                                PREFACE.


The ‘Duff Lectures’ for 1888 were delivered by me at Edinburgh in the
month of March. In introducing my subject, I spoke to the following
effect:—

‘I wish to express my deep <span class="t0 t1 t7 t12 t13 t14 t17 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">sense</span> of the responsibility which the writing
of these Lectures has laid <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> me, and my earnest <span class="t0 t10 t11 t17 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">desire</span> that they may,
by their usefulness, prove in some degree worthy of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> missionary
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> name they bear.

‘Dr. Duff was a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> of power, who <span class="t1 t7 t12 t29 hoverable">left</span> his own foot-print so deeply
impressed on the soil of Bengal, that its traces are never likely to be
effaced, and still serve to encourage less ardent spirits, who are
striving to imitate his example in the same field of labour.

‘But not only is the impress of his vigorous personality still fresh in
Bengal. He has earned an enduring reputation throughout India and the
United Kingdom, as the prince of educational missionaries. He was in all
that he undertook an enthusiastic and indefatigable workman, of whom, if
of any <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> being, it might be truly said, that, when <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> to
quit the sphere of his labours, “he needed not to be ashamed.” No one
can have travelled much in India <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> having observed how wonderfully
the results of his indomitable energy and fervid eloquence in the cause
of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Truth</span> wait on the memory of his <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> everywhere. Monuments may be
erected and lectureships founded to perpetuate his name and testify to
his victories over difficulties which few other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> could have overcome,
but better than these will be the living testimony of successive
generations of Hindu <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> and women, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> growth and progress in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span>
enlightenment will be due to the seed which he planted, and to which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span>
has given the increase.’

I said a few more <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> expressive of my hope that the ‘Life of Dr.
Duff’[1] <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be read and pondered by every student destined for <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span>
of any <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> in our Indian empire, and to that biography I refer all who
are unacquainted with the particulars of the labours of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> to whom
Scotland has assigned a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> in the foremost rank of her most eminent
Evangelists.

I now proceed to explain the process by which these Lectures have
gradually outgrown the limits required by the Duff Trustees.

When I addressed myself to the carrying out of their wishes—communicated
to me by Mr. W. Pirie Duff—I had no intention of undertaking more than a
concise <span class="t1 t11 t12 t13 t16 t18 t21 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of a subject which I had been studying for many years. I
conceived it possible to compress into six Lectures a scholarly sketch
of what may be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> Buddhism,—that is, the Buddhism of the
Pi?akas or Pali <span class="t9 t12 t13 t25 hoverable">texts</span> which are now being edited by the Pali <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Text</span>
Society, and some of which have been translated in the ‘Sacred Books of
the East.’ It soon, however, became apparent to me that to write an
<span class="t1 t11 t12 t13 t16 t18 t21 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of Buddhism which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be worthy of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Indian
missionary, I ought to exhibit it in its connexion with Brahmanism and
Hinduism and even with Jainism, and in its contrast with Christianity.
Then, as I proceeded, I began to feel that to do justice to my subject I
should be compelled to enlarge the range of my researches, so as to
embrace some of the later phases and modern developments of Buddhism.
This led me to undertake a more careful study of Koeppen’s Lamaismus
than I had before <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> necessary. Furthermore, I felt it my duty to
study attentively numerous treatises on Northern Buddhism, which I had
before read in a cursory manner. I even <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> it incumbent on me to
look a little into the Tibetan language, of which I was before wholly
ignorant.

I need scarcely explain further the process of expansion through which
the present <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> has passed. A conviction <span class="t2 t4 t6 t9 t18 t19 t22 hoverable">took</span> possession of my mind,
that any endeavour to give even an outline of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> subject of
Buddhism in six Lectures, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be rather like the effort of a foolish
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> trying to paint a panorama of London on a sheet of note-paper. Hence
the expansion of six Lectures into eighteen, and it will be seen at once
that many of these eighteen are far too <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> to have been delivered _in
extenso_. In point of fact, by an arrangement with the Trustees, only a
certain portion of any Lecture was delivered orally. The present <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> is
rather a treatise on Buddhism printed and published in memory of Dr.
Duff.

I need not encumber the Preface with a re-statement of the reasons which
have made the elucidation of an intricate subject almost hopelessly
difficult. They have been stated in the Introductory Lecture (pp. 13,
14).

Moreover the plan of the present volume has been there <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> forth (see p.
17).

I may possibly be asked by weary readers why I have ventured to add
another tributary to the too swollen stream of treatises on Buddhism? or
some may employ another metaphor and inquire why I have troubled myself
to toil and plod over a path already <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> travelled over and trodden
down? My reply is that I think I can claim for my own <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> an
individuality which separates it from that of others—an individuality
which may probably commend it to thoughtful students of Buddhism as
helping to clear a thorny road, and introduce some little <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">order</span> and
coherence into the chaotic confusion of Buddhistic ideas.

At any rate I request permission to draw attention to the following
points, which, I think, may invest my researches with a distinctive
character of their own.

In the first <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> I have been able to avail myself of the latest
publications of the Pali <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Text</span> Society, and to consult many recent <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t7 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">works</span>
which previous writers on Buddhism have not had at their command.

Secondly, I have striven to combine scientific accuracy with a popular
exposition sufficiently readable to satisfy the wants of the cultured
English-speaking world—a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> crowded with intelligent readers who <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span>
an increasing interest in Buddhism, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> know nothing of Sansk?it,
Pali, and Tibetan.

Thirdly, I have aimed at effecting what no other English Orientalist
has, to my knowledge, ever accomplished. I have endeavoured to deal with
a complex subject as a whole, and to present in one volume a
comprehensive survey of the entire range of Buddhism, from its earliest
origin in India to its latest modern developments in other Asiatic
countries.

Fourthly, I have <span class="t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> to the study of Buddhism and its sacred
language Pali, a life-long preparatory study of Brahmanism and its
sacred language Sansk?it.

Fifthly, I have on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> occasions travelled through the sacred <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">land</span> of
Buddhism (p. 21), and have carried on my investigations personally in
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> of its origin, as <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as in Ceylon and on the borders of
Tibet.

Lastly, I have depicted Buddhism from the standpoint of a believer in
Christianity, who has shown, by his other <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t7 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">works</span> on Eastern religions, an
earnest <span class="t0 t10 t11 t17 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">desire</span> to give them credit for all the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> they contain.

In regard to this last point, I shall probably be told by some
enthusiastic admirers of Buddhism, that my prepossessions and
predilections—inherited with my Christianity—have, in spite of my <span class="t0 t10 t11 t17 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">desire</span>
to be just, distorted my <span class="t25 hoverable">view</span> of a system with which I have no sympathy.
To this I can only reply, that my <span class="t0 t1 t13 t16 t24 t25 hoverable">consciousness</span> of my own prepossessions
has made me the more sensitively anxious to exhibit Buddhism under its
best aspects, as <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as under its worst. An attentive perusal of my
last Lecture (see p. 537) will, I hope, make it evident that I have at
least done everything in my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> to dismiss all prejudice from my mind,
and to assume and maintain the attitude of an impartial judge. And to
this end I have <span class="t2 t5 t11 t18 t19 t23 t26 hoverable">taken</span> nothing on trust, or at <span class="t0 t2 t5 t13 t14 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">second</span> hand. I have
studied Pali, as I have the other Indian Prak?its, on my own account,
and independently. I have not accepted unreservedly any man’s
interpretation of the original Buddhist texts, and have endeavoured to
verify for myself all doubtful statements and translations which occur
in existing treatises. Of course I owe much to modern Pali scholars, and
writers on Buddhism, and to the translators of the ‘Sacred Books of the

opinion of my own.

The translations given in the ‘Sacred Books of the East’—good as they
generally are—have seemed to me occasionally misleading. I may mention
as an instance the constant employment by the translators of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span>
‘Ordination’ for the ceremonies of admission to the Buddhist monkhood
(see pp. 76-80 of the present volume). I have ventured in such instances
to give what has appeared to me a more suitable equivalent for the Pali.
On the same principle I have avoided all needless employment of
Christian terminology and Bible-language to express Buddhist ideas.

For example, I have in most cases excluded such <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> as ‘sin,’
‘holiness,’ ‘faith’, ‘trinity,’ ‘priest’ from my explanations of the
Buddhist creed, as wholly unsuitable.

I regret that want of space has compelled me to curtail my observations
on Jainism—the present representative of Buddhistic doctrines in India
(see p. 529.) I hope to enter more fully on this subject hereafter.

The names of authors to whom students of Buddhism are indebted are given
in my first Lecture (pp. 14, 15). We all owe much to Childers. My own
thanks are specially due to General Sir Alexander Cunningham, to
Professor E. B. Cowell of Cambridge, Professor Rhys Davids, Dr.
Oldenberg, Dr. Rost, Dr. Morris, Dr. Wenzel, who have aided me with
their opinions, whenever I have <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> it right to consult them. Dr.
Rost, C.I.E., of the India Office, is also entitled to my warmest
acknowledgments for having placed at my disposal various subsidiary
<span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t7 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">works</span> bearing on Buddhism, some of which belong to his own Library.

My obligations to Mr. Hoey’s translation of Dr. Oldenberg’s ‘Buddha,’ to
the translations of the travels of the Chinese pilgrims by Professor
Legge, Mr. Beal, M. Abel Rémusat, and M. Stanislas Julien, to M. Huc’s
travels, and to Mr. Scott’s ‘Burman,’ will be evident, and have been
generally acknowledged in my notes. I am particularly grateful to Mr.
Sarat Chandra Das, C.I.E., for the information contained in his Report
and for the instruction which I received from him personally while
prosecuting my inquiries at Darjiling.

I have felt compelled to abbreviate nearly all my quotations, and
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> occasionally to alter the phraseology. Hence I have <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> it
right to mark them by a different type <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> inverted commas.

With regard to transliteration I must refer the student to the rules for
pronunciation given at p. xxxi. They conform to the rules given in my
Sansk?it Grammar and Dictionary. Like Dr. Oldenberg, I have preferred to
substitute Sansk?it terminations in _a_ for the Pali _o_. In Tibetan I
have constantly consulted Jäschke, but have not followed his system of
transliteration.

In conclusion, I may fitly draw attention to the engravings of objects,
some of which were <span class="t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> by myself from Buddhist countries. They are
described in the list of illustrations (see p. xxix), and will, I trust,
give value to the present volume. It has seemed to me a duty to make <span class="t1 hoverable">use</span>
of every available appliance for throwing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> on the obscurities of a
difficult subject; and, as these Lectures embrace the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> range of
Buddhism, I have adopted as a frontispiece a portrait of <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> which
exhibits Buddhism in its receptivity and in its readiness to adopt
serpent-worship, or any other superstition of the races which it strove
to convert. On the other hand, the Wheel, with the Tri-ratna and the
Lotus (pp. 521, 522), is engraved on the title-page as the best
representative symbol of early Buddhism. It is <span class="t2 t5 t11 t18 t19 t23 t26 hoverable">taken</span> from a Buddhist
sculpture at Amaravati engraved for Mr. Fergusson’s ‘Tree and
Serpent-worship’ (p. 237).

The portrait which faces page 74 is <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> worthy of attention as
illustrating the connexion[2] between Buddhism and Brahmanism. It is
from a recently-taken photograph of Mr. Gauri-?a?kar Uday-?a?kar,
C.S.I.—a well-known and distinguished <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> of Bhaunagar—who (with Mr.
Percival) administered the <span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">State</span> during the minority of the present
enlightened Maha-raja. Like the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> of old, he has renounced the
world—that is, he has become a Sannyasi, and is chiefly engaged in
meditation. He has consequently dropped the title C.S.I., and <span class="t2 t5 t11 t18 t19 t23 t26 hoverable">taken</span> the
religious title—Svami ?ri Saccidananda-Sarasvati. His son, Mr.
Vijay-?a?kar Gauri-?a?kar, kindly sent me the photograph, and with his
permission I have had it engraved.

It will be easily understood that, as a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> portion of the following

repetitions and recapitulations were unavoidable, but I trust I shall
not be amenable to the charge of repeating anything for the sake of
‘padding.’ I shall, with more justice, be accused of ‘cramming,’ in the

                              POSTSCRIPT.


Since writing the foregoing prefatory remarks, I have observed with much
concern that a prevalent error, in regard to Buddhism, is still
persistently propagated. It is categorically stated in a newspaper
report of a quite recent lecture, that out of the world’s population of
about 1500 millions at least 500 millions are Buddhists, and that
Buddhism numbers more adherents than any other religion on the surface
of the globe.

Almost every European writer on Buddhism, of late years, has assisted in
giving currency to this utterly erroneous calculation, and it is <span class="t17 t29 hoverable">high</span>
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> that an attempt should be made to dissipate a serious
misconception.

It is forgotten that mere sympathizers with Buddhism, who occasionally
conform to Buddhistic practices, are not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> Buddhists. In China the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> majority are first of all Confucianists and then either Taoists or
Buddhists or both. In Japan Confucianism and Shintoism co-exist with
Buddhism. In some other Buddhist countries a <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of Shamanism is
practically dominant. The best authorities (including the Oxford
Professor of Chinese, as stated in the Introduction to his excellent
<span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> ‘The Travels of Fa-hien’) are of opinion that there are not more
than 100 millions of real Buddhists in the world, and that Christianity
with its 430 to 450 millions of adherents has now the numerical
preponderance over all other religions. I am entirely of the same
opinion. I hold that the Buddhism, described in the following pages,
contained <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">within</span> itself, from the earliest times, the germs of disease,
decay, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> (see p. 557), and that its present condition is one of
rapidly increasing disintegration and decline.

We must not forget that Buddhism has disappeared from India proper,
although it dominates in Ceylon and Burma, and although a few Buddhist
travellers <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> back to the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">land</span> of its origin and sojourn
there.

Indeed, if I were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> to give a rough comparative numerical
estimate of the six chief religious systems of the world, I should be
inclined, on the whole, to regard Confucianism as constituting, next to
Christianity, the most numerically prevalent creed. We have to bear in
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> the immense populations, both in China and Japan, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> chief creed
is Confucianism.

Professor Legge informs me that Dr. Happer—an American Presbyterian
Missionary of about 45 <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> standing, who has gone carefully into the
statistics of Buddhism—reckons only 20 millions of Buddhists in China,
and not more than 72½ millions in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> of Asia. Dr. Happer states
that, if the Chinese were required to class themselves as Confucianists
or Buddhists or Taoists, 19/20ths, if not 99/100ths, of them would, in
his opinion, claim to be designated as Confucianists.

In all probability his estimate of the <span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span> of Buddhists in China is
too low, but the Chinese ambassador Liu, with whom Professor Legge once
had a conversation on this subject, ridiculed the <span class="t25 hoverable">view</span> that they were as
numerous as the Confucianists.

Undeniably, as it seems to me, the next <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> after Christianity and
Confucianism should be given to Brahmanism and Hinduism, which are not
really <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> systems but practically one; the latter being merely an
expansion of the former, modified by contact with Buddhism.

Brahmanism, as I have elsewhere shown, is nothing but <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span>
Pantheism; that is, a belief in the universal diffusion of an impersonal
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Spirit</span> (called <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> or Brahma)—as the only really existing
Essence—and in its manifesting itself in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Mind</span> and in countless material
forces and forms, including gods, demons, men, and animals, which, after
fulfilling their course, must ultimately be re-absorbed into the one
impersonal Essence and be again evolved in endless evolution and
dissolution.

Hinduism, with its <span class="t0 t5 t11 hoverable">worship</span> of Vish?u and ?iva, is based on this
pantheistic doctrine, but the majority of the Hindus are merely
observers of Brahmanical institutions with their accompanying Hindu
caste usages. If, however, we employ the term Hindu in its widest
acceptation (omitting only all Islamized Hindus) we may safely affirm
that the adherents of Hinduism have reached an aggregate of nearly 200
millions. In the opinion of Sir William Wilson Hunter, they are still
rapidly increasing, both by excess of births over deaths and by
accretions from more backward systems of belief.

Probably Buddhism has a right to the fourth <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> in the scale of
numerical comparison. At any rate the <span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span> of Buddhists can scarcely
be calculated at less than 100 millions.

In regard to Muhammadanism, this creed should not, I think, be placed
<span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> than fifth in the enumeration. In its purest <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> it ought to be
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Islam, and in that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> it is a mere distorted copy of Judaism.

The Empress of India, as is <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> known, rules over more Muhammadans than
any other potentate in the world. Probably the Musalman population of
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> of India now numbers 55 millions.

As to the <span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span> of Muhammadans in the Turkish empire, there are no very
trustworthy data to guide us, but the aggregate is believed to be about
14 millions; while Africa can scarcely reckon more than that number,
even if <span class="t6 hoverable">Egypt</span> be included.

The sixth system, Taoism (the system of Lao-tsze), according to
Professor Legge, should rank numerically after both Muhammadanism and
Buddhism.

Of course Jainism (p. 529) and Zoroastrianism (the religion of the
Parsis) are too numerically insignificant to occupy places in the above
comparison.

It is possible that a careful census might result in a more favourable
estimate of the <span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span> of Buddhists in the world, than I have here
submitted; but at all events it may safely be alleged that, even as a
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of popular religion, Buddhism is gradually losing its
vitality—gradually loosening its hold on the vast populations once loyal
to its rule; nay, that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> is rapidly approaching when its capacity
for resistance must give <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> before the mighty forces which are destined
in the end to sweep it from the earth.

  17. Sculpture of <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> in ‘Witness-attitude’ on attaining Buddhahood,
      under the tree (an umbrella is above)                           478
      Found at Buddha-Gaya. Date about the 9th century. The original
          is remarkable for its smiling features and for the
          circular mark on the forehead. The drawing is from a
          photograph belonging to Sir A. Cunningham.

  18. Sculpture of <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> in ‘Witness-attitude’ on attaining Buddhahood
      under the tree                                                  480
      From a niche <span class="t17 t29 hoverable">high</span> up on the western side of the Buddha-Gaya
          temple. It has the ‘Ye dharma’ formula (p. 104) inscribed
          on each side. It is half the size of the original
          sculpture. Probable date about the 11th century.

  19. Sculpture found at Buddha-Gaya representing the earliest Triad,
      viz. Buddha, Dharma, and Sa?gha                                 485
      The drawing is from a photograph belonging to Sir A.
          Cunningham, described at p. 484.

  20. Votive Stupa found at Buddha-Gaya                     _To face_ 505
      Probable date about 9th or 10th century of our era.

  21. Clay model of a small votive Stupa                              506
      Selected from several which the author saw in the act of being
          made by a monk outside a monastery in British Sikkim in
          1884. This model probably contains the ‘Ye dharma’ or some
          other formula on a seal inside. The engraving is exactly
          the size of the original.

see that the _u_ in _Bud_dha, must not be pronounced like the _u_ in the

                               BUDDHISM.




                               LECTURE I.
          _Introductory. Buddhism in relation to Brahmanism._


In my recent work[3] on Brahmanism I have traced the progress of Indian
religious <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> through <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> successive stages—called by me Vedism,
Brahmanism, and Hinduism—the last including the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> subdivisions of
?aivism, Vaish?avism, and ?aktism. Furthermore I have attempted to prove
that these systems are not really separated by sharp lines, but that
each almost imperceptibly shades off into the other.

I have striven also to show that a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> Hindu of the orthodox school is
able quite conscientiously to accept all these developments of religious
belief. He holds that they have their authoritative exponents in the
successive bibles of the Hindu religion, namely, (1) the four
Vedas—?ig-veda, Yajur-veda, Sama-veda, Atharva-veda—and the Brahma?as;
(2) the Upanishads; (3) the Law-books—especially that of Manu; (4) the
Bhakti-?astras, including the Ramaya?a, the Maha-bharata, the
Pura?as—especially the Bhagavata-pura?a—and the Bhagavad-gita; (5) the
Tantras.

The chief <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t7 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">works</span> under these five heads represent the principal periods
of religious development through which the Hindu <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> has passed.

Thus, in the first place, the hymns of the Vedas and the ritualism of
the Brahma?as represent physiolatry or the <span class="t0 t5 t11 hoverable">worship</span> of the personified
forces of nature—a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of religion which ultimately became saturated
with sacrificial ideas and with ceremonialism and asceticism. Secondly,
the Upanishads represent the pantheistic conceptions which terminated in
philosophical Brahmanism. Thirdly, the Law-books represent caste-rules
and domestic usages. Fourthly, the Ramaya?a, Maha-bharata, and Pura?as
represent the principle of personal devotion to the personal gods, ?iva,
Vish?u, and their manifestations; and fifthly, the Tantras represent the
perversion of the principle of <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> to polluting and degrading practices
disguised under the name of religious rites. Of these five phases of the
Hindu religion probably the first <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> only prevailed when Buddhism
arose; but I shall try to make clear hereafter that Buddhism, as it
developed, accommodated itself to the fourth and even ultimately to the
fifth phase, admitting the Hindu <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> into its own creed, while Hinduism
also received ideas from Buddhism.

At any rate it is clear that the so-called orthodox <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> admits all
five series of <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t7 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">works</span> as progressive exponents of the Hindu
system—although he scarcely likes to confess openly to any adoption of
the fifth. Hence his opinions are of necessity Protean and multiform.

The root ideas of his creed are of course Pantheistic, in the <span class="t0 t1 t7 t12 t13 t14 t17 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">sense</span> of
being grounded on the identification of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> external world—which
he believes to be a mere illusory appearance—with one eternal,
impersonal, <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> Essence; but his religion is capable of presenting
so many phases, according to the stand-point from which it is viewed,
that its pantheism appears to be continually sliding into forms of
monotheism and polytheism, and even into the lowest types of animism and
fetishism.

We must not, moreover, forget—as I have pointed out in my recent
work—that a large <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> of the Hindus are unorthodox in respect of their
interpretation of the leading doctrine of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> Brahmanism.

Such unorthodox persons may be described as sectarians or dissenters.
That is to say, they dissent from the orthodox pantheistic doctrine that
all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> and men, all <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> souls, and all material
appearances are mere illusory manifestations of one impersonal <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span>
Entity—called Atman or Purusha or Brahman—and they believe in one
supreme personal god—either ?iva or Vish?u or K?ish?a or Rama—who is not
liable (as orthodox Brahmans say he is) to lose his personality by
subjection to the universal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">law</span> of dissolution and re-absorption into
the one <span class="t0 t28 hoverable">eternal</span> impersonal Essence, but exists in a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heaven</span> of his own,
to the bliss of which his worshippers are admitted[4].

And it must be borne in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> that these sectarians are very far from
resting their belief on the Vedas, the Brahma?as, and Upanishads.

Their creed is based entirely on the Bhakti-?astras—that is, on the
Ramaya?a, Maha-bharata, and Pura?as (especially on the Bhagavata-pura?a)
and the Bhagavad-gita, to the exclusion of the other scriptures of
Hinduism.

Then again it must always be borne in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> that the terms ‘orthodox’ and
‘unorthodox’ have really little or no application to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> majority
of the inhabitants of India, who in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> are wholly innocent of any
theological opinions at all, and are far too apathetic to trouble
themselves about any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of religion other than that which has belonged
for centuries to their families and to the localities in which they
live, and far too ignorant and dull of intellect to be capable of
inquiring for themselves <span class="t0 t5 t8 t10 t14 t15 t21 t24 t28 hoverable">whether</span> that religion is likely to be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> or
false.

To classify the masses under any one definite denomination, either as
Pantheists or Polytheists or Monotheists, or as simple idol-worshippers,
or fetish-worshippers, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be wholly misleading.

Their faculties are so enfeebled by the debilitating effect of early
marriages, and so deadened by the drudgery of daily toil and the dire
necessity of keeping <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> together, that they can scarcely be
said to be capable of holding any definite theological creed at all.

It <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be nearer the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> to say that the religion of an ordinary
Hindu consists in observing caste-customs, local usages, and family
observances, in holding what may be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the Folk-legends of his

and superscription of the Empress of India, impressed on the current
coin of the country.

As a rule such a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> gives himself no uneasiness whatever about his

What he really troubles himself about is the necessity for securing the
present favour of the inhabitants of the unseen world, supposed to
occupy the atmosphere everywhere around him—of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> demons
and spirits of the soil—generally represented by rude and grotesque
images, and artfully identified by village priests and Brahmans with
alleged forms of Vish?u or ?iva.

It follows that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> of the ordinary Hindu, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> indifferent about
all definite dogmatic religion, is steeped in the <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of religiousness
best expressed by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> {deisidaimonia}. He lives in perpetual dread
of invisible <span class="t0 t1 t15 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> who are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> to be exerting their mysterious
influences above, below, around, in the immediate vicinity of his own
dwelling. The very winds which sweep across his homestead are believed
to swarm with spirits, who unless duly propitiated will blight the
produce of his fields, or <span class="t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t27 t29 hoverable">bring</span> down <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> him injury, disease, and
death.

Then again, besides the orthodox and besides the sectarian Hindu and
besides the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> demon-worshipping, idolatrous, and superstitious
majority, another class of the Indian community must also be <span class="t2 t5 t11 t18 t19 t23 t26 hoverable">taken</span> into
account—the class of rationalists and free-thinkers. These have been
common in India from the earliest times.

First came a class of conscientious doubters, who strove to solve the
riddle of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> by microscopic self-introspection and sincere searchings
after truth, and these did their best not to break with the Veda, Vedic
revelation, and the authority of the Brahmans.

Earnestly and reverently such <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> applied themselves to the difficult
task of trying to answer such questions as—What am I? Whence have I
come? Whither am I going? How can I explain my <span class="t0 t1 t13 t16 t24 t25 hoverable">consciousness</span> of personal
existence? Have I an immaterial <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> distinct from, and independent
of, my material frame? Of what <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> in which I <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span>
myself? Did an all-powerful Being create it out of nothing? or did it
evolve itself out of an <span class="t0 t28 hoverable">eternal</span> protoplasmic germ? or did it come
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> by the combination of <span class="t0 t28 hoverable">eternal</span> atoms? or is it a mere illusion?
If created by a Being of infinite <span class="t7 t8 t12 hoverable">wisdom</span> and love, how can I <span class="t1 t11 t12 t13 t16 t18 t21 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> for
the co-existence in it of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> and evil, happiness and misery? Has the
Creator form, or is He formless? Has He qualities and affections, or has
He none?

It was in the effort to solve such insoluble enigmas by their own
unaided intuitions and in a manner not too subversive of traditional
dogma, that the systems of philosophy founded on the Upanishads
originated.

These have been described in my <span class="t6 t8 t10 t11 t16 t20 t21 t27 t28 hoverable">book</span> on Brahmanism. They were gradually
excogitated by independent thinkers, who claimed to be Brahmans or
twice-born men, and nominally accepted the Veda with its Brahma?as,
while they covertly attacked it, or at least abstained from denouncing
it as absolutely untrue. Such <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> tacitly submitted to sacerdotal
authority, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> they really propounded a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> of salvation based
entirely on self-evolved knowledge, and quite independent of all Vedic
sacrifices and sacrificing priests. The most noteworthy and orthodox of
the systems propounded by them was the Vedanta[5], which, as I have
shown, was simply <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> Pantheism, and asserted that the one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Spirit</span>
was the only real Being in the Universe.

But the origin of the more unorthodox systems, which denied the
authority of both the Veda and the Brahmans, must also be traced to the
influence of the Upanishads. For it is undeniable that a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> of
atheistic infidelity grew up in India almost _pari passu_ with dogmatic
Brahmanism, and has always been prevalent there. In <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be
easy to show that periodical outbursts of unbelief and agnosticism have
<span class="t2 t5 t11 t18 t19 t23 t26 hoverable">taken</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> in India very much in the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> as in Europe; but the
tendency to run into extremes has always been greater on Indian soil and
beneath the glow and glamour of Eastern skies. On the one side, a far
more unthinking respect than in any other country has been paid to the
authority of priests, who have declared their supernatural revelation to
be the very breath of God, sacrificial rites to be the sole instruments
of salvation, and themselves the sole mediators between <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> and
heaven; on the other, far greater latitude than in any other country has
been conceded to infidels and atheists who have poured contempt on all
sacerdotal dogmas, have denied all supernatural revelation, have made no
secret of their disbelief in a personal God, and have maintained that
even if a Supreme Being and a <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> exist they are unknowable
by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> and beyond the cognizance of his faculties.

We learn indeed from certain passages of the Veda (?ig-veda II. 12. 5;
VIII. 100. 3, 4) that even in the Vedic age some denied the existence of
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">god</span> Indra.

We know, too, that Yaska, the well-known Vedic commentator, who is
believed to have lived before the grammarian Pa?ini (probably in the
fourth century B.C.), found himself obliged to refute the sceptical
arguments of Kautsa and others who pronounced the Veda a tissue of
nonsense (Nirukta I. 15, 16).

Again, Manu—whose law-book, according to Dr. Bühler, was composed
between the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t13 t14 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">second</span> century B.C. and the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t13 t14 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">second</span> A.D., and, in my opinion,
possibly earlier—has the following remark directed against sceptics:—

‘The twice-born <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> who depending on rationalistic treatises
(hetu-?astra) contemns the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> roots of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">law</span> (?ruti and sm?iti), is to be
excommunicated (vahish-karya?) by the righteous as an atheist (nastika)
and despiser of the Veda’ (Manu II. 11).

Furthermore, the Maha-bharata, a poem which contains many <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span>
legends quite as <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> as those of early Buddhism, relates
(?anti-parvan 1410, etc.) the story of the infidel Carvaka, who in the
disguise of a mendicant <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> uttered sentiments dangerously
heretical.

This Carvaka was the supposed founder of a materialistic school of
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Lokayata. Rejecting all instruments of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span>
(prama?a) except perception by the senses (pratyaksha), he affirmed that
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> did not exist separately from the body, and that all the
phenomena of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> were spontaneously produced.

The following abbreviation of a <span class="t28 hoverable">passage</span> in the Sarva-dar?ana-sa?graha[6]
will give some <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> of this school’s infidel doctrines, the very name of
which (Lokayata, ‘generally current in the world’) is an evidence of the
popularity they enjoyed:—

  No <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heaven</span> exists, no final liberation,
  No soul, no other world, no rites of caste,
  No recompense for acts; let <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> be spent,
  In merriment[7]; let a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> borrow money
  And live at ease and feast on melted butter.
  How can this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> when reduced to dust
  Revisit earth? and if a ghost can <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t11 t12 t19 t22 hoverable">pass</span>
  To other worlds, why does not strong affection
  For those he leaves behind attract him back?
  Oblations, funeral rites, and sacrifices
  Are a mere means of livelihood devised
  By sacerdotal cunning—nothing more.
  The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> composers of the triple Veda
  Were rogues, or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> spirits, or buffoons.
  The recitation of mysterious <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span>
  And jabber of the priests is simple nonsense.

Then again, the continued prevalence of sceptical opinions may be shown
by extracts from other portions of the later literature. For example, in
the Ramaya?a (II. 108) the infidel <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> Javali gives utterance to
similar sentiments thus:—

‘The books composed by theologians, in which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> are enjoined to
worship, give gifts, offer sacrifice, practise austerities, abandon the
world, are mere artifices to draw forth donations. Make up your <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span>
that no one exists hereafter. Have regard only to what is visible and
perceptible by the senses (pratyaksham). Cast everything beyond this
behind your back.’

Furthermore, in a parallel <span class="t28 hoverable">passage</span> from the Vish?u-pura?a, it is
declared that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Deceiver, practising illusion, beguiled other
demon-like <span class="t0 t1 t15 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> to embrace many sorts of heresy; some reviling the
Vedas, others the gods, others the ceremonial of sacrifice, and others
the Brahmans[8]. These were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Nastikas.

Such extracts prove that the worst forms of scepticism prevailed in both
early and mediæval times. But all phases and varieties of heretical
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> were not equally offensive, and it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> certainly be unfair and
misleading to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> Buddhism and Jainism on the same level with the
reckless Pyrrhonism of the Carvakas who had no code of morality.

And indeed it was for this very reason, that when Buddhism and Jainism
began to make their presence felt in the fifth century B.C. they became
far more formidable than any other phase of scepticism.

Whether, however, Buddhism or Jainism be entitled to chronological
precedence is still an open question, about which opinions may
reasonably differ. Some hold that they were always quite distinct from
each other, and were the products of inquiry originated by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span>
independent thinkers, and many scholars now consider that the weight of
evidence is in favour of Jainism being a little antecedent to Buddhism.
Possibly the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> systems resulted from the splitting up of one sect into
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> divisions, just as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> Brahma-Samajes of Calcutta are the
product of the Adi-Samaj.

One point at least is certain, that notwithstanding much community of
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> between Buddhism and Jainism, Buddhism ended in gaining for
itself by far the more important position of the two. For although
Jainism has shown more tenacity of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> in India, and has lingered on
there till the present day, it never gained any hold on the masses of
the population, whereas its rival, Buddhism, radiating from a central
point in Hindustan, spread itself first over the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> of India and then
over nearly all Eastern Asia, and has played—as even its most hostile
critics must admit—an important rôle in the history of the world.

To Buddhism, therefore, we have now to direct our attention, and at the
very threshold of our inquiries we are confronted with this difficulty,
that its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> popularity and its wide diffusion among many peoples have
made it most difficult to answer the question:—What is Buddhism? If it
were possible to reply to the inquiry in one word, one might perhaps say
that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> Buddhism, theoretically stated, is Humanitarianism, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> by
that term something very like the gospel of humanity preached by the
Positivist, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> doctrine is the elevation of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> through man—that is,

differs toto cælo from the Positivist’s, and consists in the
renunciation of all personal existence, even to the extinction of
humanity itself. The Buddhist’s perfection is destruction (p. 123).

But such a reply <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have only reference to the truest and earliest

of a subject which, as it grew, became multiform, multilateral, and
almost infinite in its ramifications.

Innumerable writers, indeed, during the past thirty <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> have been

developments have varied in every country; while lecturers, essayists,
and the authors of magazine articles are constantly adding their
contributions to the mass of floating ideas, and too often propagate
crude and erroneous conceptions on a subject, the depths of which they
have never thoroughly fathomed.

It is to be hoped that the annexation of Upper Burma, while giving an
impulse to Pali and Buddhistic studies, may help to throw <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> on some
obscure points.

Certainly Buddhism continues to be little understood by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>
majority of educated persons. Nor can any misunderstanding on such a
subject be matter of surprise, when writers of <span class="t17 t29 hoverable">high</span> character colour
their descriptions of it from an examination of one part of the system
only, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> due regard to its other phases, and in this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> either
exalt it to a far <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> position than it deserves, or depreciate it
unfairly.

And Buddhism is a subject which must continue for a <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> to present
the student with a boundless field of investigation. No one can <span class="t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t27 t29 hoverable">bring</span> a
proper capacity of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> to such a study, much less write about it
clearly, who has not studied the original documents both in Pali and in
Sansk?it, after a <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> course of preparation in the study of Vedism,
Brahmanism, and Hinduism. It is a system which resembles these other
forms of Indian religious <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> variety of its aspects.
Starting from a very simple proposition, which can only be described as
an exaggerated truism—the truism, I mean, that all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> involves sorrow,
and that all sorrow results from indulging desires which ought to be
suppressed—it has branched out into a vast <span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span> of complicated and
self-contradictory propositions and allegations. Its teaching has become
both negative and positive, agnostic and gnostic. It passes from
apparent atheism and materialism to theism, polytheism, and
spiritualism. It is under one aspect mere pessimism; under another pure
philanthropy; under another monastic communism; under another <span class="t17 t29 hoverable">high</span>
morality; under another a variety of materialistic philosophy; under
another simple demonology; under another a mere farrago of
superstitions, including necromancy, witchcraft, idolatry, and
fetishism. In some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> or other it may be held with almost any
religion, and embraces something from almost every creed. It is founded
on philosophical Brahmanism, has much in common with Sa?khya and Vedanta
ideas, is closely connected with Vaish?avism, and in some of its phases
with both ?aivism and ?aktism, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> is, properly speaking, opposed to
every one of these systems. It has in its moral code much common ground
with Christianity, and in its mediæval and modern developments presents
examples of forms, ceremonies, litanies, monastic communities, and
hierarchical organizations, scarcely distinguishable from those of Roman
Catholicism; and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> a greater contrast than that presented by the
essential doctrines of Buddhism and of Christianity can scarcely be
imagined. Strangest of all, Buddhism—with no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> than the perfect

word, and is wholly destitute of the vivifying forces necessary to give
vitality to the dry bones of its own morality; and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> it once existed
as a real <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> over at least a <span class="t26 hoverable">third</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> race, and even at the
present moment claims a vast <span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span> of adherents in Asia, and not a few
sympathisers in Europe and America.

Evidently, then, any Orientalist who undertakes to give a clear and
concise <span class="t1 t11 t12 t13 t16 t18 t21 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of Buddhism in the compass of a few lectures, must <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span>
himself engaged in a very venturesome and difficult task.

Happily we are gaining acquaintance with the Southern or purest <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of
Buddhism through editions and translations of the <span class="t9 t12 t13 t25 hoverable">texts</span> of the Pali
Canon by Fausböll, Childers, Rhys Davids, Oldenberg, Morris, Trenckner,
L. Feer, etc. We owe much, too, to the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t7 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">works</span> of Turnour, Hardy, Clough,
Gogerly, D’Alwis, Burnouf, Lassen, Spiegel, Weber, Koeppen, Minayeff,
Bigandet, Max Müller, Kern, Ed. Müller, E. Kuhn, Pischel, and others.
These enable us to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> a fair estimate of what Buddhism was in its
early days.

But the <span class="t5 t16 t21 t24 t25 hoverable">case</span> is different when we turn to the Northern Buddhist
Scriptures, <span class="t2 t11 t15 t19 t25 t27 hoverable">written</span> generally in tolerably correct Sansk?it (with
Tibetan translations). These continue to be little studied,
notwithstanding the materials placed at our command and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span>
done, first by the distinguished ‘founder of the study of Buddhism,’
Brian Hodgson, and by Burnouf, Wassiljew, Cowell, Senart, Kern, Beal,
Foucaux, and others. In fact, the moment we <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t11 t12 t19 t22 hoverable">pass</span> from the Buddhism of
India, Ceylon, Burma, and Siam, to that of Nepal, Kashmir, Tibet,
Bhutan, Sikkim, China, Mongolia, Manchuria, Corea, and Japan, we seem to
have entered a labyrinth, the clue of which is continually slipping from
our hands.

Nor is it possible to classify the varying and often conflicting systems
in these latter countries, under the one general title of Northern
Buddhism.

For indeed the changes which religious systems undergo, even in
countries adjacent to each other, not unfrequently amount to an entire
reversal of their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> character. We may illustrate these changes by
the variations of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> derived from one and the same root in
neighbouring countries. Take, for example, the German <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> selig,
‘blessed,’ and knabe, ‘a boy,’ which in England are represented by
‘silly’ and ‘knave.’

A similar <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">law</span> appears to hold <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> in the <span class="t5 t16 t21 t24 t25 hoverable">case</span> of religious ideas. Their
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> character seems to change by a change of latitude and longitude.
This is even <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> of Christianity. Can it be maintained, for instance,
that the Christianity of modern Greece and Rome has much in common with
early Christianity, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> any casual observer believe that the
inhabitants of St. Petersburg, Berlin, Edinburgh, London, and Paris were
followers of the same religion?

It cannot <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> surprise us if Buddhism developed into apparently
contradictory systems in different countries and under varying climatic
conditions. In no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> countries did it preserve the same features. Even
in India, the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">land</span> of its birth, it had greatly changed during the first
ten centuries of its prevalence. So much so that had it been possible
for its founder to reappear <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> in the fifth century after
Christ, he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have failed to recognize his own child, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have
found that his own teaching had not escaped the operation of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">law</span> which
experience proves to be universal and inevitable.

It is easy, therefore, to understand how difficult it will be to give
any semblance of unity to my present subject. It will be impossible for
me to treat as a consistent <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> a system having a perpetually varying
front and no settled form. I can only give a series of somewhat rough,
though, I hope, trustworthy outlines, as far as possible in methodical
succession.

And in the carrying out of such a design, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> objects that will at
first naturally present themselves for delineation will be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> which
constitute the well-known triad of early Buddhism—that is to say, the
<span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> himself, His <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Law</span> and His <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Order</span> of Monks.

Hence my aim will be, in the first place, to give such a historical
<span class="t1 t11 t12 t13 t16 t18 t21 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> and of his earliest teaching as may be gathered
from his legendary biography, and from the most trustworthy parts of the
Buddhist canonical scriptures. Secondly, I shall give a brief
description of the origin and composition of those scriptures as
containing the Buddha’s ‘Law’ (Dharma); and thirdly, I shall endeavour
to explain the early constitution of the Buddha’s <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Order</span> of Monks
(Sa?gha). After treating of these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> preliminary topics, I shall next
describe the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Law</span> itself; that is, the philosophical doctrines of
Buddhism, its code of morality and theory of perfection, terminating in
Nirva?a. Lastly, I shall attempt to trace out the confused outlines of
theistic, mystical, and hierarchical Buddhism, as developed in Northern
countries, adding an <span class="t1 t11 t12 t13 t16 t18 t21 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of sacred objects and places, and
contrasting the chief doctrines of Christianity. In regard to the
Buddhism of Tibet, I shall chiefly base my explanations on Koeppen’s
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> work—a <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> never translated into English and now out of print—as

India bordering on that country.

And here I ought to <span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> that my explanations and descriptions will, I
fear, be wholly deficient in picturesqueness. My simple aim will be to
convey clear and correct information in unembellished language; and in
doing this, I shall often be compelled to expose myself to the reproach
contained in the expressions, _carvita-carva?am_, ‘chewing the chewed,’
and _pish?a-pesha?am_, ‘grinding the ground.’ I shall constantly be
obliged to tread on ground already <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> trodden.

To begin, then, with the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> himself.




                              LECTURE II.
                  _The <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> as a personal Teacher._


It is much to be regretted that among all the sacred books that
constitute the Canon of the Southern Buddhists (see p. 61)—the only <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span>
Canon of Buddhism—there is no trustworthy biography of its Founder.

For Buddhism is nothing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> Buddha, just as Zoroastrianism is
nothing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> Zoroaster, Confucianism nothing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> Confucius,
Muhammadanism nothing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> Muhammad, and I may add with all
reverence, Christianity nothing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> Christ.

Indeed, no religion or religious system which has not emanated from some
one heroic central personality, or in other words, which has not had a
founder <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> strongly marked personal character constituted the very
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> of his teaching and the chief factor in its effectiveness,
has ever had any chance of achieving world-wide acceptance, or ever
spread far beyond the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> of its origin.

Hence the barest outline of primitive Buddhism must be incomplete
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> some sketch of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> and character of Gautama <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> himself.
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> it is difficult to <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> any sure basis of <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> on which we may
construct a fairly credible biography.

In all likelihood legendary histories of the Founder of Buddhism were
current in Nepal and Tibet in the early centuries of our era; but
unhappily his too enthusiastic and imaginative admirers have <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> it
right to testify their admiration by interweaving with the probable
facts of Gautama Buddha’s life, fables so extravagant that some modern
critical scholars have despaired of attempting to sift <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> from
fiction, and have even gone to the extreme of doubting that Gautama
<span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> ever lived at all.

To believe nothing that has been recorded about him, is as unreasonable
as to accept with unquestioning <span class="t7 t13 t19 t20 t29 hoverable">faith</span> all the miraculous circumstances
which are made to encircle him as with a halo of <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> glory.

We must bear in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> that when Gautama <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> lived—about the fifth
century B.C.—the <span class="t1 t3 t4 t7 t8 t14 t15 t16 t17 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">art</span> of writing was not common in India[9]. We may point
out, too, that in all countries, European as <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as Asiatic—notably in
Greece (witness, for example, the familiar instance of Socrates)—men
have <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> more of preserving the sayings of their teachers than of
recording the facts of their lives.

And we must not forget that in India—where the imaginative faculties
have always been too active, and anything like real history is
unknown—any plain matter-of-fact biography of the most heroic personage
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have few charms for any one, and little chance of gaining
acceptance anywhere.

Hence it has happened that the ballads (gatha) and legends current about
Gautama among Northern Buddhists, bristle with the wildest fancies and
the most absurd exaggerations.

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> it is not impossible to detect a few scattered historical facts
beneath stories, however childish, and legends, however extravagant. We
shall not at least be far wrong, if, in attempting an outline of the
Buddha’s life, we begin by asserting that intense individuality, fervid
earnestness, and severe simplicity of character, combined with singular
beauty of countenance, calm dignity of bearing, and above all, almost
superhuman persuasiveness of speech, were conspicuous in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>
Teacher.

The earliest authorities, however, never claim for him anything
extraordinary or superhuman in regard to external form. It was only in
later times that Buddhist writers pandered to the superstitions of the
people, by describing the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> as possessed of various miraculous
characteristics of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> and body. He is said to have been of immense
stature—according to some, eighteen feet high—and to have had on his
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> thirty-two chief auspicious marks (maha-vyañjana), regarded as
indications of a Supreme <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> and Universal Ruler, eighty secondary
marks (anu-vyañjana), besides one hundred and eight symbols on the sole
of each foot, and a halo extending for six feet round his person.

All that can be said with any degree of probability about his personal
appearance is, that he was endowed with certain qualities, which acted
like a spell, or with a <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of irresistible magnetism, on his hearers.
These must have formed, so to speak, the foundation-stone on which the
superstructure of his vast influence rested.

ITINERATION AND PREACHING FOR FORTY-FIVE YEARS.]

Unhappily, no authoritative Buddhist scripture gives any trustworthy
clue to the exact year of the Buddha’s birth. The traditions which refer
back his _death_ to a date corresponding to 543 B.C. are now rejected by
modern European scholars. Nor can we as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> accept as infallible the
results of the latest researches, which making <span class="t1 hoverable">use</span> of various other
data, such as the inscriptions on coins, rocks, and columns, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> his
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> more than a century later. We shall not, however, be far wrong if
we assert that he was <span class="t9 t24 hoverable">born</span> about the year 500 B.C. at Kapila-vastu (now
Bhuila)—a town situated about half-way between Basti and Ajudhya
(Ayodhya) in the territory of Kosala (the modern Oudh, see pp. 29, 48),
about sixty miles from its capital <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">city</span> ?ravasti (a favourite residence
of Gautama), and about one hundred miles[10] north-west of Benares, and
near the borders of the kingdom of Magadha (now Behar).

His father, named ?uddhodana, was a land-owner of the tribe of the
?akyas (a name possibly connected with the Sansk?it root ?ak, ‘to be
powerful’), <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> territory in the Gorakh-pur district extended from the
lower Nepalese mountains to the river Rapti in Oudh. It has been
conjectured that the ?akyas may have been originally a non-Aryan tribe,
connected perhaps with certain nomad immigrants from Tibet or Northern
Asia, who may have immigrated into India at various periods; but even if
this could be proved, it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have to be admitted that the ?akyas had
become Aryanized. It is said that the chief families claimed to be
Rajputs, tracing back their origin to Ikshvaku, the first of the Solar
race. It appears, too, that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> belonging to the Kshatriya caste,
they were agriculturists, and mainly engaged in the cultivation of rice.
It is also asserted that ?akya families were in the habit of taking the
name of the family of the Brahmans who were their <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> guides and
performed religious offices for them, and that the family of ?uddhodana
<span class="t2 t4 t6 t9 t18 t19 t22 hoverable">took</span> the name Gautama, that is, descendant of the sage Gotama. It does
not, however, seem necessary to <span class="t1 t11 t12 t13 t16 t18 t21 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> for the name in this manner. It
was an auspicious name, which in <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> times might have been given to
the child of any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> land-owner as a proof of orthodoxy, or with the
view, perhaps, of pleasing the Brahmans and securing their prayers and
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> wishes on its behalf.

The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">father</span> of the Founder of Buddhism was simply a chief of the ?akya
tribe—certainly not a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> in our <span class="t0 t1 t7 t12 t13 t14 t17 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">sense</span> of the term—but rather a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>
Zamindar or landlord, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> territory was not so large in area as
Yorkshire. His name ?uddhodana, ‘one possessed of pure rice,’ probably
indicated the occupation and ordinary <span class="t0 t14 t23 t24 hoverable">food</span> of the peasantry inhabiting
the district belonging to him and subject to his authority. Those who
have travelled much in India must often have met <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> land-owners of
the ?uddhodana type—men to whom the title Maha-raja is given much as
‘Lord’ is to our aristocracy. For example, the Maha-raja of Darbhanga is
probably a more important personage than Gautama’s <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">father</span> ever was, and
his territory larger than that of ?uddhodana ever was.

The name Gautama (in Pali spelt Gotama) was the personal name
corresponding to that given to all <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">children</span> at the name-giving ceremony.
It was not till his supposed attainment of perfect <span class="t7 t8 t12 hoverable">wisdom</span> that Gautama
assumed the title of Buddha, or ‘the enlightened one.’ But from that
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> forward this became his recognized title. Every other name besides
Gautama (or Gotama), and every other title except <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> (or together,
Gautama Buddha), are simply epithets; for example, ?akya-muni, ‘sage of
the tribe of the ?akyas;’ ?akya-si?ha, ‘lion of the ?akyas;’ ?rama?a
(Samano), ‘the ascetic;’ Siddhartha, ‘one who has fulfilled the <span class="t24 t25 hoverable">object</span>
(of his coming);’ Sugata, ‘whose coming is auspicious;’ Tathagata, ‘who
comes and goes as his predecessors;’ Bhagavan (Bhagava), ‘the <span class="t2 t15 t24 hoverable">blessed</span>
lord;’ ?asta (Sattha), ‘the Teacher;’ A?ara?a-?ara?a, ‘Refuge of the
refugeless;’ Aditya-bandhu, ‘Kinsman of the Sun;’ Jina, ‘conqueror;’
Maha-vira, ‘great hero;’ Maha-purusha, ‘great man;’ Cakravarti,
‘universal monarch.’ Devout Buddhists <span class="t8 t13 t21 hoverable">call</span> him ‘Lord of the World,’ ‘the
Lord,’ ‘World-honoured One,’ ‘King of the Law,’ ‘the Jewel,’ etc.; and
prefer to <span class="t1 hoverable">use</span> the titles rather than the personal name Gautama, which is
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> too familiar.

The names of previous Buddhas, supposed to have existed in previous
ages, are given at p. 136.

Little of the story of the miraculous birth of <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> is worthy of
repetition. Since, however, a white elephant is reckoned among the
sacred objects of Buddhism, as something rare and precious, it is worth
while mentioning the fable, that when the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> came for the Bodhi-sattva

Buddha, he descended into the womb of his mother in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of a white
elephant. He was <span class="t9 t24 hoverable">born</span> under a ?al tree and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">god</span> Brahma received him
from his mother’s side. His mother, Maya, died seven <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">days</span> afterwards,
and the infant was committed to her sister (Maha-prajapati), a <span class="t0 t2 t5 t13 t14 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">second</span>
wife of ?uddhodana.

It is not related of Gautama that, as he grew up, any efforts were made
to imbue him with sacred learning; though, as a Kshatriya, he was
privileged to receive instruction in certain portions of the Veda.

Nor are we told of him that as a Kshatriya he was trained to the
profession of a soldier. It is more probable, that his <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> of
contemplation developed itself very early, and that from a <span class="t0 t10 t11 t17 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">desire</span> to
humour this not uncommon Oriental propensity, he was allowed to <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t11 t12 t19 t22 hoverable">pass</span>
most of his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> in the open air.

There is a well-known legend, which relates how Gautama’s relations came
in a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> to his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">father</span> and complained that the youth’s deficiency in
martial and athletic exercises <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> incapacitate him, on reaching
manhood, from taking part in warlike expeditions. This might be reckoned
among the few trustworthy historical incidents, were the story not
marred by the legendary addition, that on a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> of trial being fixed,
the youth, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> any previous practice, and of course to the surprise
of all present, proved his superiority in archery and in ‘the twelve
arts.’

One statement may certainly be accepted <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> much qualification. It
is said that Gautama was made to marry early, according to the universal
custom throughout India in the present day. No <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> of any respectable
<span class="t0 t4 t5 t10 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">person</span> in modern times could remain unmarried at the age of sixteen or
seventeen, without, so to speak, tarnishing the family escutcheon, and
exposing the youth himself to a serious social stigma, likely to cling
to him in after-life. In <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> times marriage was equally universal,
and there is no <span class="t1 t11 t16 t20 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">reason</span> to suppose that among Kshatriyas it was delayed
to a much later period of life.

No doubt, therefore, the future <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> had at least one wife (whose name
was Ya?odhara, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> often <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Rahula-mata, ‘Rahula’s mother’), and
probably at least one son, named Rahula. It is said that this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> was

The story of the four visions, which led to his final renunciation of
the world, is profusely overlaid with fanciful hyperbole, but, however
slight the basis of <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> on which it may reasonably be held to rest, it
is too picturesque and interesting to be passed over <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> notice. I

the Chinese version of the Abhi-nishkrama?a-sutra, varying (for the sake
of brevity) the phraseology, but retaining the expression ‘prince’:—

One <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> the prince Gautama resolved to visit the gardens in the
neighbourhood of his father’s city, desiring to examine the beautiful
trees and flowers.

Then there appeared before his <span class="t2 t6 t19 t20 t26 t29 hoverable">eyes</span> in one of the streets the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of a
decrepid[**decrepit] old man, his skin shrivelled, his <span class="t1 t4 t9 t16 hoverable">head</span> bald, his
teeth gone, his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> infirm and bent. A staff supported his tottering
limbs, as he stood right across the path of the prince’s advancing
chariot.

Seeing this aged person, Siddhartha inquired of his charioteer:—‘What
<span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> is this, so miserable and so distressing, the like of which I
have never seen before?’

The charioteer replied:—‘This is what is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> an old man.’

The prince again inquired:—‘And what is the exact <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> of this
expression “old”?’

The charioteer answered:—‘Old age implies the loss of bodily power,
decay of the vital functions, and failure of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> and memory. This poor
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> before you is old and approaching his end.’

Then asked the prince:—‘Is this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">law</span> universal?’

‘Yes,’ he replied, ‘this is the common lot of all living creatures. All
that is <span class="t9 t24 hoverable">born</span> must die.’

Soon afterwards another strange sight presented itself—a sick man, worn
by disease and suffering, pale and miserable, scarcely able to draw his
breath, was seen tottering on the road.

Then the prince inquired of his charioteer:—‘Who is this unhappy being?’

The charioteer replied:—‘This is a sick man, and such sickness is common
to all.’

Soon afterwards there passed before them a corpse, borne on a bier.

Then asked the prince:—‘Who is this borne onwards on his bed, covered
with strangely-coloured garments, surrounded by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> weeping and
lamenting?’

‘This,’ replied the charioteer, ‘is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> a dead body; he has ended his
life; he has no further beauty of form, and no desires of any kind; he
is one with the stones and the felled tree; he is like a ruined wall, or
fallen leaf; no more shall he see his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">father</span> or mother, brother or
sister, or other relatives; his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> is dead, and your <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> also must
come to this.’

Next <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> on his going out by a different gate there appeared advancing
with measured steps a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> with a shaven crown, and monk’s robe—his right
shoulder bare, a religious staff in his right hand, and a mendicant’s
alms-bowl in his left.

‘Who is this,’ the prince inquired, ‘proceeding with slow and dignified
steps, looking neither to the right <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> nor to the left, absorbed in
thought, with shaven <span class="t1 t4 t9 t16 hoverable">head</span> and garments of reddish colour?’

‘This man,’ said the charioteer, ‘devotes himself to charity, and
restrains his appetites and his bodily desires. He hurts nobody, but
does <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> to all, and is <span class="t10 t16 hoverable">full</span> of sympathy for all.’

Then the prince asked the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> himself to give an <span class="t1 t11 t12 t13 t16 t18 t21 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of his own
condition.

He answered:—‘I am <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> a homeless ascetic; I have forsaken the world,
relatives, and friends; I seek deliverance for myself and <span class="t0 t10 t11 t17 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">desire</span> the
salvation of all creatures, and I do harm to none.’

After hearing these words, the prince <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> to his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">father</span> and said, ‘I
wish to become a wandering ascetic (parivrajika) and to seek Nirvana;
all worldly things, O king! are changeable and transitory.’

Such is an epitome of the legendary story of the ‘four visionary
appearances,’ so <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> because they are supposed to have been <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span>
visions or appearances, miraculously produced. The remainder of the
legendary <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of Gautama <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> is interesting and here and there not

abridged form.

Very shortly after the occurrences just described, Gautama receives
<span class="t5 t15 t21 t27 hoverable">intelligence</span> of the birth of his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> Rahula. This is the first momentous
crisis of his life, and Gautama remains for a <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> lost in profound
thought. He sees in his child the strongest of all fetters, binding him
to family and home. But his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> is made up. He must fly at once, or be
for ever held in bondage. Around him gather the beautiful women of his
father’s household, striving by their blandishments to divert him from
his purpose; but in vain. He seeks the chamber of his wife, and finds
her asleep with her <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> on the <span class="t1 t4 t9 t16 hoverable">head</span> of his infant son. He longs for a
last embrace; but fearing to arouse her suspicions hurries away.
Outside, his favourite horse is waiting to aid his flight. He
accomplishes the first stage of what Buddhists <span class="t8 t13 t21 hoverable">call</span> with pride the
Mahabhinishkrama?a, ‘the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> going forth from home;’ but not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span>
overcoming other still more formidable trials. For Mara, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> deity
who tempts <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> to indulge their passions (see p. 120), makes himself
visible, and promises the prince all the glories of empire if he will
return to the pleasures of worldly life.

Finding all his allurements disregarded, Mara alters his method of
attack; he fills the air with mighty thunderings, and creates on the
road before the youthful fugitive’s <span class="t2 t6 t19 t20 t26 t29 hoverable">eyes</span> apparitions of torrents, lofty
mountains, and blazing conflagrations. But nothing alarms or deters him.
‘I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> rather,’ he exclaims, ‘be torn to pieces limb by limb, or be

Arrived at a safe distance from his father’s territory, he exchanges
garments with a passing beggar, cuts off his own hair with a sword, and
assumes the outward aspect and character of a wandering ascetic. The
hair does not fall to the ground but is <span class="t2 t5 t11 t18 t19 t23 t26 hoverable">taken</span> up to the Trayastri??as

Magadha, which, with Kosala (Oudh, pp. 21, 48), afterwards became the

There he attaches himself as a disciple to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span>

and theory of salvation. Sufficient evidence exists to warrant a belief
in this part of the story.

No <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> in India abounds in more interesting Buddhistic remains than
Raja-g?iha (about 40 miles south-east of Patna), proving that it was one
of the most sacred places of Buddhism, consecrated by some of its most
cherished associations. Its Pali name is Raja-gaha. It may be
conjectured that the connexion between the metaphysics of Buddhism and
those of Brahmanism was due to Gautama’s intercourse with the Brahmans
of this district, and to the ideas he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> imbibed at the earliest stage
of his career.

But to resume our story. Gautama fails to <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> in Brahmanical philosophy
that rest and peace for which his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> was craving when he <span class="t1 t7 t12 t29 hoverable">left</span> his
home.

Still there was another <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> of emancipation and union with the Universal
Soul, taught by the Brahmans. This was the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> of Tapas[11], or
self-inflicted bodily pain and austerity.

From the earliest times a favourite doctrine of Brahmanism has been,
that self-inflicted bodily suffering is before all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> efficacious
for the accumulation of religious merit, for the acquirement of
supernatural powers, and for the spirit’s release from the bondage of
transmigration and its re-absorption into the One Universal Spirit.

Among other forms of self-inflicted pain, religious devotees (Tapasvis)
sometimes <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> through the process of sitting all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> unmoved
during the hottest months on a prepared platform or plot of ground,
surrounded by five fires, or by four blazing fires, with the burning <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t21 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">sun</span>
above their heads as a fifth[12]. Even <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> (and notably ?iva) are
described as mortifying themselves by bodily austerities (_tapas_), so
as not to be outdone by men; for according to the theory of Hinduism,
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> themselves might be supplanted and even ousted from their rank
and position as divinities by the omnipotence acquirable by <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span>
devotees through a protracted endurance of severe bodily suffering.

Hence we are not surprised to <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> it recorded of Gautama Buddha, that
seeking in vain for rest in the teaching of Brahmanical philosophy, and
eager to try the effect of a course of self-mortification, he wandered
forth from Raja-g?iha to a wood in the district of Gaya, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Uruvilva
(or Uruvela).

There, in company with five other ascetics, he began his celebrated
sexennial fast. Sitting down with his legs folded under him on a raised
seat in a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> unsheltered from sun, wind, rain, dew, and cold, he
gradually reduced his daily allowance of <span class="t0 t14 t23 t24 hoverable">food</span> to a single grain of rice.
Then holding his breath, he harassed and macerated his body, but all in
vain. No peace of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> came, and no <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> enlightenment. He became
convinced of his own folly in resorting to bodily austerity as a means
of attaining supreme enlightenment, and delivering himself from the
evils and sufferings of life.

Rousing himself, as if from a troubled dream, he <span class="t2 t4 t6 t9 t18 t19 t22 hoverable">took</span> <span class="t0 t14 t23 t24 hoverable">food</span> and
nourishment in a natural way, thereby incurring the temporary
disapproval of his five companions in self-mortification. Then, when
sufficiently refreshed, he moved away to another spot in the same
district. There, under the shelter of a sacred fig-tree (A?vattha,
_Ficus religiosa_, known as the Pippala or Pipal), in a village,
afterwards <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Buddha-Gaya, he gave himself up to <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span>
forms of meditation (Jhana = Dhyana). In this he merely conformed to the
Hindu Yoga,—a method of attaining mystic union with the Deity, which
although not then formulated into a system, was already in vogue among
the Brahmans. There can be little doubt that the Dhara?a, Dhyana (see p.
209), and Samadhi of the Yoga were resorted to, even in Gautama’s time,
as a means for the attainment of perfect <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> illumination, as <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span>
as of final absorption in the Deity.

In Manu VI. 72 it is said:—‘Let him purge himself from all taints
(doshan) by suppression of breath, from <span class="t2 t5 t8 t17 t18 t19 hoverable">sin</span> by restraints of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span>
(dhara?abhi?), from sensual attachments by control, and from unspiritual
qualities by meditation (dhyanena).’

In the later <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Bhagavad-gita (see p. 95 of this volume) it is
declared:—‘holding his body, head, and neck quite immovable, seated on a
firm seat in a pure spot with Ku?a grass around, the devotee (Yogi)
should look only at the tip of his nose, and should meditate on the
Supreme Being’ (VI. 11, 12). Further on he is directed to meditate so
profoundly as to think about nothing whatever (VI. 25).

The very Gayatri or <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> Vedic prayer (?ig-veda III. 62. 10, see p.
78 of this volume)—which is to Hindus what the Lord’s Prayer is to
Christians, and is still repeated by millions of our Indian
fellow-subjects at their daily devotions—was originally an act of
meditation, performed with the very <span class="t24 t25 hoverable">object</span> Gautama had in view—supreme
enlightenment of mind:—‘Let us meditate (Dhimahi, root _dhyai_) on the
excellent <span class="t3 t22 t28 hoverable">glory</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> vivifying Sun, may he enlighten our
understandings.’ Even the selection of a seat under an A?vattha tree was
in keeping with Brahmanical ideas (see ‘Brahmanism and Hinduism,’ p.
335).

The first result, however, of his engaging in abstract meditation, was
that he seemed to himself to be as far as ever from the emancipation
which was the one aim of his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> renunciation. Why not then return to
the world? Why not indulge again in the pleasures of sense? Why not go
back to home, wife, and child? Thoughts of this <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> passed through his
mind, while all his old affections and feelings seemed to revive with
tenfold intensity. Then on one particular night, during this mental
struggle, Mara, the Destroyer and personification of carnal desire,
seized his opportunity. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> had bided his time; had
waited to assail the sage at the right moment, when protracted
self-mortification had done its work—when with exhausted strength he had
little <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of resistance.

It is certainly remarkable that a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> struggle between <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> and evil,

darkness, is recognized in all religious systems, however false. (See a
notable allusion to this in ?a?kara’s Commentary to Chandogya Upanishad,
p. 26, ll. 2-8.)

The legendary description of the Buddha’s temptation, and of the assault
made <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> him by Mara (the deadly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> of sensuous desire[13]), and by
all his troop of attendants, is so interesting and curious,
notwithstanding its extravagance, that I here abridge it:—

Fiends and demons swarmed about him in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of awful monsters,
furies, vampires, hobgoblins, armed to the teeth with every implement of
destruction. Their million faces were frightful to behold, their limbs
encircled by myriads of serpents, their heads enveloped in a blaze of
fire. They surrounded the saint and assailed him in a <span class="t6 hoverable">thousand</span> different
ways. Missiles of all kinds were hurled against him; poison and <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span>
were showered over him—but the poison changed into flowers, the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span>
formed a halo round his head.

The baffled <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> one now shifted his ground. He summoned his sixteen
enchanting daughters, and sent them to display their charms in the
presence of the youthful saint. But the resolute young ascetic was not
to be lured by their wiles. He remained calm and impassive, and with a
stern <span class="t3 hoverable">face</span> rebuked the maidens for their boldness, forcing them to
retire discomfited and disgraced.

Other forms of temptation followed, and the debilitated ascetic’s
strength seemed to be giving way. But this was merely the crisis. After
rising to <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> stages of abstract meditation at the end of
a <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> night he shook off his foe. The victory was won, and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> of
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> broke <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> his mind. A legend relates that in the first
night-watch he gained a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of all his previous existences; in the
second—of all present states of being; in the third—of the chain of
causes and effects (p. 102); and at the dawn of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> he knew all things.

The dawn on which this remarkable struggle terminated was the birthday
of Buddhism. Gautama was at that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> about thirty-five <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> of age. It
was then, and not till then, that his Bodhi-sattvaship (see p. 135)
ended and he gained a right to the title Buddha, ‘the Enlightened.’ No
wonder that the tree under which he sat became celebrated as ‘the tree
of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> and enlightenment.’ It is remarkable, too, that just as the
night on which the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> attained perfect enlightenment is the most
sacred night with Buddhists, so the Bodhi-tree (in familiar language,
Bo-tree) is their most sacred symbol—a symbol as dear to Buddhists as
the Cross is to Christians.

And what was this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> knowledge, evolved out of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> sublimated by
intense meditation?

This is, perhaps, the strangest point of all in this strange story. It
was after all a mere partial one-sided truth—the outcome of a single
line of thought, dwelt <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> with morbid intensity, to the exclusion of
every other line of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> which might have modified and balanced it.
It was an ultra-pessimistic <span class="t25 hoverable">view</span> of the miseries of life, and a
determination to ignore all its counterbalancing joys. It was the
doctrine that this present <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> is only one link in a chain of countless
transmigrations—that existence of all kinds involves suffering, and that
such suffering can only be got rid of by self-restraint and the
extinction of desires, especially of the <span class="t0 t10 t11 t17 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">desire</span> for continuity of
personal existence.

For let it be made clear at the outset, that whatever may be said of the
Christian-like self-renunciation enjoined by the Buddhist code of
morality, the only self it aims at renouncing is the self of
personality, and the chief self-love it deprecates is the self-love
which consists in craving for continuous <span class="t22 t25 hoverable">individual</span> life.

To those who have never travelled or resided much in the East,
indulgence in such a morbid <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of pessimism, under glowing skies and
amid bright surroundings, may seem almost an impossibility. But those
who know India by personal experience are aware that its climate is not
conducive to optimistic views of life, and that even in the present <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span>
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> of the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> type, who seek in various ways to impress their
pessimistic theories of existence on their fellow-men, are not uncommon.

In the course of my travels I frequently met ascetics who had given up
family and friends, and were leading a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of morose seclusion, and
pretended meditation, undergoing <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> courses of bodily mortification.
Nay, I have even seen <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> who, to prove their utter contempt for the
pleasures of worldly existence, and to render themselves fit for the
extinction of all personality by absorption into the Universal Soul,
have sat in one posture, or held up one arm for years, or allowed
themselves no bed but a bed of spikes, no shelter but the foliage of
trees[14]. Gautama’s course of protracted cogitation <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> had in it
nothing peculiar or original.

Nor need we doubt that certain historical facts underlie the legendary
narrative. We cannot admit with the learned Senart and Kern that the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of Gautama was based on a mere solar myth. To us it is more
difficult not to believe than to believe that there lived in the fifth
century B.C. the youthful <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> of a petty Raja or land-owner in Oudh,
distinguished from ordinary <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> by many remarkable qualities of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> and
body—notably by a thoughtful and contemplative disposition; that he
became impressed with a <span class="t0 t1 t7 t12 t13 t14 t17 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">sense</span> of the vanity of all earthly aims, and of
the suffering caused by disease and death; that he often said to
himself, ‘Life is but a troubled dream, an incubus, a nightmare,’ or,
like the Jewish sage of old, ‘All the <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">days</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> are sorrow,’ ‘Man
walketh in a vain shadow and disquieteth himself in vain;’ and that like
many other of the world’s philosophers, instead of acquiescing in the
<span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> around him, and striving to make the best of them, or to
improve them, he <span class="t2 t4 t6 t9 t18 t19 t22 hoverable">took</span> refuge from the troubles of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> in abandoning all
its ties, renouncing all its joys, and suppressing all its affections
and desires.

And again, it is more difficult not to believe than to believe that in
such a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> introspection and abstinence, protracted for many years,
induced a condition of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> favourable to ecstatic visions, which were
easily mistaken for flashes of inner enlightenment.

We know, indeed, that eleven centuries later another <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> thinker arose
among the Semitic races in Western Asia, who <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> through the same <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span>
of mental struggle, and that Muhammad, like Gautama, having by his <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span>
fasts and austerities <span class="t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> himself into a highly wrought condition of
the nervous system, became a fanatical believer in the reality of his
own delusions and in his own <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> commission as a teacher.

But the parallel between the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> and Muhammad cannot be carried on
much further. And indeed, in point of fact, no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> characters could be
more different. For the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> never claimed to be the channel of a
supernatural revelation; never represented the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> that burst on
his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> as springing from any but an internal source; never taught that
a <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> force operating from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> compelled him to communicate that
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> to mankind; never dreamed of propagating that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> to
others by compulsion, much less by the sword. On the contrary, he always
maintained that the only revelation he had received was an illumination
from within—due entirety to his own intuitions, assisted by his
reasoning powers and by severe purgatorial discipline protracted through
countless previous births in every variety of bodily form.

But how did this internal self-enlightenment[15]—the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>
distinguishing feature of Buddhism—first <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> expression? It is said
that the first <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> uttered by the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> at the momentous crisis when
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> burst <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> him, were to the following effect:—

‘Through countless births have I wandered, seeking but not discovering
(anibbisan) the maker of this my mortal dwelling-house (gaha-karaka),
and still again and again have birth and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> and pain returned. But now

gained at last’ (Dhamma-pada 153, 154, Suma?gala 46).

Contrast with these first utterances of Gautama <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> the first <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span>
of <span class="t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t15 t18 t19 t22 t26 t27 hoverable">Jesus</span> Christ:—

‘Wist ye not that I must be about My Father’s business?’ (St. Luke ii.
49.)

The Buddha’s first exclamations, as <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as the <span class="t1 t11 t12 t13 t16 t18 t21 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of his
subsequent sayings and doings, are the more worthy of credit as <span class="t2 t5 t11 t18 t19 t23 t26 hoverable">taken</span>
from the Southern Canon.

The Maha-vagga (I. 1) tells us that after attaining complete
intelligence, the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> sat cross-legged on the ground under the
Bodhi-tree for seven days, absorbed in meditation and enjoying the bliss
of enlightenment. At the end of that period, during the first <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span>
watches of the night, he fixed his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> on the causes of existence. Then
having <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> out the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">law</span> of causation (p. 102), he exclaimed: ‘When
the laws of being become manifest to the earnest thinker, his doubts
vanish, and, like the Sun, he dispels the hosts of Mara.’

Next he meditated for another seven <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">days</span> under a banyan tree, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the
tree of goat-herds (aja-pala). It was there that a haughty <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span>
accosted him with the question, ‘Who is a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> Brahman?’ and was told,
‘One <span class="t1 t8 hoverable">free</span> from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> and pride; self-restrained, learned, and pure.’

Then he meditated under another tree for a <span class="t26 hoverable">third</span> period of seven days.
There the serpent (Naga) Mucalinda (or Mucilinda) coiled his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> round
the Buddha, and formed a canopy to protect him from the raging of a
storm—this being one of the trials he had to go through. When it was
over the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> exclaimed, ‘Happy is the seclusion of the satisfied <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span>
(tush?a) who has learned and seen the truth.’

A fourth period of meditation was passed under the tree Rajayatana,
making four times seven days. May not these symbolize the four stages of
meditation (p. 209)? Later legends, however, reckon seven times seven
days.

During the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> of the interval between the first acquisition of
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> and the setting forth to proclaim it, the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> fasted, being
too elated to seek food, and only once receiving it from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> merchants,
named Tapussa (Trapusha) and Bhallika. These became his first
lay-reverers (p. 89) by repeating the _double_ formula of reverence for
the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> and for his doctrine (the Sa?gha not being then instituted,
Maha-v° I. 4. 5). A later legend relates that they received in return
eight of his hairs which they preserved as relics.

In connexion with the legend of a forty-nine days’ fast, I may mention
that an <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> carving of Gautama was pointed out to me at Buddha-Gaya,
which represents him as holding a bowl of rice-milk divided into
forty-nine portions, one for each day.

With these legends we may contrast the simple Gospel narrative of
Christ’s forty days’ fast in the wilderness.

The Buddha’s first resolution to come forth from his seclusion and
proclaim his gospel to mankind is of course a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> epoch with all
Buddhists.

And here it should be observed, that, strictly, according to Gautama’s
own teaching he ought to have ceased from all action on arriving at
perfect enlightenment. For had he not attained the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> <span class="t24 t25 hoverable">object</span> of his
ambition—the end of all his struggles—the goal of all his
efforts—carried on through hundreds of existences? He had, therefore, no
more lives to lead, no more misery to undergo. In short he had achieved

passions and desires—and had only to enjoy the well-earned peace
(nirv?iti) of complete Nirva?a. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> the <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> of his fellow-men impelled
him to action (prav?itti). In <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> it was characteristic of a supreme
<span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> that he should belie, by his own activity and compassionate
feelings, the utter apathy and indifference to which his own doctrines
logically led (p. 128).

But he did not carry out his benevolent design <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> going through

To counteract these malevolent suggestions, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">god</span> Brahma Sahampati

was only natural that the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> should think of wending his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> in the
first instance to Benares, even if special considerations had not drawn
him there; for that <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">city</span> was the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> centre of Eastern <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> and
life, the Indian Athens, where all peculiar doctrines were most likely
to gain a hearing.

On his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> thither, Upaka, a member of the Ajivaka sect of naked
ascetics, met him and inquired why his countenance was so bright
(pari?uddha)? He replied, ‘I am the all-subduer, the all-wise, the
stainless, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t22 t23 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">highest</span> teacher, the conqueror (p. 135); I go to Benares
to dissipate the world’s darkness’ (Maha-vagga I. 6. 7).

The five ascetics (Kau??inya = Ko??añño, A?vajit = Assaji, Vashpa,
Mahanama, and Bhadrika) were soon converted by his words, and by merely
repeating the triple formula were admitted at once to his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Order</span> of

Sa?gha, or fraternity of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> seeking release from the misery of
existence by cœnobitic monasticism.

And of what <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> were Gautama Buddha’s first didactic utterances? His
first sermon, delivered in the Deer-park at Benares, is held in as much
reverence by Buddhists as the first <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> of <span class="t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t13 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">Christ</span> are by Christians.

The following is the substance of it, as given in the Maha-vagga (I. 6.
17). It is important to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">note</span> that the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> spoke in the vernacular of

‘There are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> extremes (anta), O monks (Bhikkhus), to be avoided by one
who has given up the world—a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> devoted to sensual pleasures (kama),
which is degrading, common, vulgar, ignoble, profitless; and a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span>
given to self-mortification (atma-klamatha)—painful, ignoble,
profitless. There is a middle path, avoiding both extremes—the noble
eightfold path discovered by the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> (Tathagata)—which leads to
insight, to wisdom, to quietude (upa?ama), to knowledge, to perfect
enlightenment (sambodhi), to final extinction of <span class="t0 t10 t11 t17 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">desire</span> and suffering
(Nirva?a).’

So far there is nothing very explicit in the discourse. Doubtless such
precepts as ‘virtue is a mean’ and that ‘medio tutissimus ibis’ are
useful, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> trite, truths; but the difficulty is to prove that the
Buddha’s eightfold path is really a middle course of the <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> described;
for the most fanatical enthusiasts will always regard their own creed,
however extravagant, as moderate.

The Buddha, therefore, goes on to propound what he calls the four noble
truths (ariya-saccani = arya-satyani), which are the key to his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span>
doctrine. They may be stated thus:—

1. All existence—that is, existence in any form, <span class="t0 t5 t8 t10 t14 t15 t21 t24 t28 hoverable">whether</span> on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> or in
heavenly spheres—necessarily involves pain and suffering (dukkha). 2.
All suffering is caused by lust (raga) or craving or <span class="t0 t10 t11 t17 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">desire</span> (ta?ha =
trish?a, ‘thirst’) of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> kinds—for sensual pleasure (kama), for
wealth (vibhava), and for existence (bhava). 3. Cessation of suffering
is simultaneous with extinction of lust, craving, and <span class="t0 t10 t11 t17 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">desire</span> (p. 139).
4. Extinction of lust, craving, and desire, and cessation of suffering
are accomplished by perseverance in the noble eightfold path (ariyo
a??hangiko maggo), viz. right belief or views (samma di??hi), right
resolve (sa?kappo), right speech, right <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> (kammanto), right
livelihood (ajivo), right exercise or training (vayamo = vyayama), right
mindfulness (sati, p. 50), right mental concentration (samadhi).

And how is all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> mere suffering (I.6.19)?—

  ‘Birth is suffering. Decay is suffering. Illness is suffering. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Death</span>
  is suffering. Association with (samprayogo) objects we hate is
  suffering. Separation from objects we <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> is suffering. Not to obtain
  what we <span class="t0 t10 t11 t17 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">desire</span> is suffering. Clinging (upadana) to the five elements
  (p. 109) of existence is suffering. Complete cessation of thirst
  (ta?ha) and desires is cessation of suffering. This is the noble <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span>
  of suffering.’

This sermon (called in Ceylon the first Ba?a = Bha?a, ‘recitation,’ p.
70) was addressed to monks, and however unfavourably it must compare
with that of <span class="t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t13 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">Christ</span> (St. Luke iv. 18), addressed not to monks but to
suffering sinners—and however obvious may be the <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> that pain must
result from giving <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> to lust and the <span class="t0 t10 t11 t17 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">desire</span> for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> through countless
existences—is of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> interest because it embodies the first teaching
of one, who, if not worthy to be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> ‘the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Light</span> of Asia,’ and
certainly unworthy of comparison with the ‘Light of the World,’ was at
least one of the world’s most successful teachers.

Bear in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> that, as the result of his earliest meditation (pp. 39, 56,
102), the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> made ignorance precede lust as the primary cause of
life’s misery.

Of course the real significance of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> sermon depends on the
interpretation of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> ‘right’ (samma = samyak) in describing the
eightfold path, and the plain explanation is that ‘right belief’ means
believing in the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> and his doctrine; ‘right resolve’ means
abandoning one’s wife and family as the best method of extinguishing the
fires of the passions; right speech is recitation of the Buddha’s
doctrine; right <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> (Karmanta) is that of a monk; right livelihood is
living by alms as a monk does; right exercise is suppression of the
<span class="t22 t25 hoverable">individual</span> self; right mindfulness (Sm?iti) is keeping in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> the
impurities and impermanence of the body; right mental concentration is
trance-like quietude.

Mark, too, that in describing the misery of life, association with loved
objects is not mentioned as compensating for the pain of connexion with
hateful objects.

The Buddha’s early disciples were not poor men; for the sixth to be
admitted to the Sa?gha was a high-born youth named Yasa. Then this
youth’s father, a rich merchant, became the first lay-disciple by
repeating the _triple_ formula (pp. 40, 78), and his mother and wife
became the first lay-sisters. Next, four high-born friends of Yasa, and
subsequently fifty more became monks. Thus, not <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> after the first
sermon, Gautama had sixty enrolled monks; all from the upper classes.

In sending forth these sixty monks to proclaim his own gospel of
deliverance, he addressed them thus:—

‘I am delivered from all fetters (p. 127), <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> and divine. You too, O
monks, are freed from the same fetters. Go forth and wander everywhere,
out of compassion for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> and for the welfare of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> and men. Go
forth, one by one, in different directions. Preach the doctrine
(Dharmam), salutary (kalya?a) in its beginning, middle, and end, in its
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> (artha) and in its letter (vyañjana). Proclaim a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of perfect
restraint, chastity, and celibacy (brahmacariyam). I will go also to

When his monk-missionaries had departed, Gautama himself followed,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> not till Mara (p. 41) had again tempted him. Quitting Benares he
journeyed back to Uruvela, near Gaya. There he first converted thirty
rich young <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> and then one <span class="t6 hoverable">thousand</span> orthodox Brahmans, led by Ka?yapa
and his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> brothers, who maintained a sacred <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> (‘Brahmanism,’ p.
364). The fire-chamber was haunted by a fiery snake-demon; so <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span>
asked to occupy the room for a night, fought the serpent and confined
him in his own alms-bowl. Next he worked other miracles (said to have
been 3500 in number), such as causing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> to recede, fire-wood to
split, fire-vessels to appear at his word. Then Ka?yapa and his
brothers, convinced of his miraculous powers, were admitted with the
other Brahmans to the Sa?gha. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> gathered round him about a
<span class="t6 hoverable">thousand</span> monks.

To them on a hill Gayasisa (Brahma-yoni), near Gaya, he preached his
‘burning’ fire-sermon (Maha-v° I. 21): ‘Everything, O monks, is burning
(adittam = adiptam). The eye is burning; visible <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> are burning. The
sensation produced by contact with visible <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> is burning—burning
with the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> of lust (desire), enmity and delusion (ragaggina dosaggina
mohaggina), with birth, decay (jaraya), death, grief, lamentation, pain,
dejection (domanassehi), and despair (upayasehi). The ear is burning,
sounds are burning; the nose is burning, odours are burning; the tongue
is burning, tastes are burning; the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> is burning, objects of <span class="t0 t1 t7 t12 t13 t14 t17 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">sense</span>
are burning. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> is burning, thoughts are burning. All are burning
with the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> of passions and lusts. Observing this, O monks, a <span class="t5 t8 hoverable">wise</span> and
noble disciple becomes weary of (or disgusted with) the eye, weary of
visible things, weary of the ear, weary of sounds, weary of odours,
weary of tastes, weary of the body, weary of the mind. Becoming weary,
he frees himself from passions and lusts. When free, he realizes that
his <span class="t24 t25 hoverable">object</span> is accomplished, that he has lived a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of restraint and
chastity (brahma-cariyam), that re-birth is ended.’

It is said that this fire-sermon—which is a key to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> of
Nirva?a—was suggested by the sight of a conflagration. It was Gautama’s
custom to impress ideas on his hearers by pointing to visible objects.
He compares all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> to a flame; and the gist of the discourse is the
duty of extinguishing the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> of lusts, and with it the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> of all
existence, and the importance of monkhood and celibacy for the
attainment of this end.

Contrast in Christ’s Sermon on the Mount the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> addressed to the
multitude (not to monks), ‘Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall
see God.’

The <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> and his followers next proceeded to Raja-g?iha. Among them
were two, afterwards <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> ‘chief disciples’ (Agra-?ravakas), Sariputta
and Moggallana (or Maudgalyayana), who died before the Buddha, and
sixteen leaders among the so-called eighty ‘_great_ disciples’
(Maha-?ravakas); the chief of these being Ka?yapa (or Maha-ka?yapa),
Upali, and Ananda (a cousin), besides Anuruddha (another cousin), and
Katyayana. Of course among the eighty are reckoned the five original
Benares converts. At a later <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> chief female disciples
(Agra-?ravikas) named Khema and Uppala-va??a (Utpala-var?a) were added
(see p. 86). Each leading disciple was afterwards <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Sthavira, ‘an
elder,’ or Maha-sthavira, ‘great elder’ (Pali Thera, Mahathera; fem.
Theri). Mark, too, that Bimbi-sara, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> of Magadha, and Prasenajit
(Pasenadi), <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> of Kosala, were Gautama’s lay-disciples and constant
patrons.

It was not <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> before the Buddha’s followers were more formally
incorporated into a monastic <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Order</span> (Sa?gha), and rules of discipline
drawn up (see pp. 61, 72, 73, 83). And doubtless the success of Buddhism
was due to the carrying out of this <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> of establishing a brotherhood
<span class="t6 hoverable">offering</span> a haven of rest to all.

About forty-five <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> elapsed between Gautama’s attainment of
Buddhahood and his death. During that period he continued teaching and
itinerating with his disciples; only going ‘into retreat’ during the
rains. A list of 45 places of residence is given. He seems to have
resided oftenest at ?ravasti (p. 21) in the monastery Jetavana given by
Anatha-pi??ika; but the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> region between ?ravasti and Raja-g?iha (p.
29), for nearly 300 miles, was the scene of his itineration. Favourite
resorts near Raja-g?iha were the ‘Vulture-peak’ and Bambu-grove
(Ve?u-vana); but continual itineration was one chief means of
propagating Buddhism.

It is said that his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> occurred at Ku?i-nagara[16] (Kusinara), a town
about eighty miles east of Kapila-vastu—the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> of his birth—when he
was eighty <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> of age, and probably about the year 420 B.C.[17]

The story is that Gautama died from eating too much pork (or dried
boar’s flesh[18]). As this is somewhat derogatory to his dignity it is
not likely to have been fabricated. A fabrication, too, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> scarcely
make him guilty of the inconsistency of saying ‘Kill no living thing,’
and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> setting an example of eating flesh-meat.

These were his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> when he felt his end near:—

‘O Ananda, I am now grown old, and <span class="t10 t16 hoverable">full</span> of years, and my journey is
drawing to its close; I have reached eighty years—my sum of days—and
just as a worn-out cart can only with much care be made to move along,
so my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> can only be kept going with difficulty. It is only when I
become plunged in meditation that my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> is at ease. In future be ye to
yourselves your own light, your own refuge; seek no other refuge. Hold
fast to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> as your lamp. Hold fast to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> as your refuge;
look not to any one but yourselves as a refuge’ (Maha-parinibbana-sutta
II. 32, 33).

Afterwards he gave a summary of every monk’s duties, thus:—‘Which then,
O monks, are the truths (=the seven jewels, p. 127) it behoves you to
spread abroad, out of pity for the world, for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> and men?
They are: 1. the four earnest reflections (Sm?iti, Sati-pa??hana, on the
impurities of the body, on the impermanence of the sensations, of the
thoughts, of the conditions of existence, p. 127); 2. the four right
exertions (Sammappadhana, viz. to prevent demerit from arising, get rid
of it when arisen, produce merit, increase it); 3. the four paths to
supernatural <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> (Iddhi-pada, viz. will, effort, thought, intense
thought); 4. the five forces (Pañca-bala, viz. faith, energy,
recollection, self-concentration, reason); 5. the proper <span class="t1 hoverable">use</span> of the five
organs of sense; 6. the seven ‘limbs’ of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> (Bodhy-a?ga, viz.
recollection, investigation, energy, joy, serenity, concentration of
mind, equanimity); 7. the noble ‘eightfold path’ (p. 44). See
Maha-parinibbana III. 65.

Then shortly before his decease, he said, ‘It may be, Ananda, that in
some of you the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> may arise:—The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> of our Teacher are ended;
we have lost our Master. But it is not thus. The truths and the rules of
the Order, which I have taught and preached, let these be your teacher,
when I am gone’ (VI. 1).

‘Behold now, O monks, I exhort you:—Everything that cometh into being
passeth away; <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> out your own perfection with diligence’ (III. 66).

Not <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> after his last utterances the Buddha, who had before through
intense meditation attained Nirva?a or extinction of the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> of
desires, passed through the four stages of meditation (p. 209) till the
moment came for his Pari-nirva?a, whereby the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> also was
extinguished. A couch had been placed for him between <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> ?al trees (p.
23), with the <span class="t1 t4 t9 t16 hoverable">head</span> towards the north. In sculptures he is represented as
lying on his right side at the moment of death, and images of him in
this position are highly venerated.

The chief <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> of Ku?i-nagara burnt his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> with the ceremonies usual at
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> of a Cakravartin or Universal Ruler, which the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> claimed
to be.

Then his ashes were distributed among eight princes, who built Stupas
over them (Buddha-va?sa 28).

A legend states that when the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> died there was an earthquake. Then
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> Brahma and Indra appeared and the latter exclaimed: ‘Transient
are all the elements of being; birth and decay are their nature; they
are <span class="t9 t24 hoverable">born</span> and dissolved; then only is happiness when they have ceased to
be’ (Maha-p° VI. 16).

Contrast with Buddha’s last <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> the last <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> of Christ: ‘Father,

A greater contrast than that presented by the <span class="t1 t11 t12 t13 t16 t18 t21 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the Buddha’s
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> and the Gospel narrative of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> of <span class="t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t13 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">Christ</span> can scarcely be
imagined.

Of course as a result of discourses during forty-five years, a large
<span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span> were gathered into Gautama’s monastic Order. His first aim was
the founding of this Order, and his chief sermons were to his monks; but
he accepted all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> and ultimately multitudes attached themselves to him
as lay-brethren (p. 87).

In <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> Gautama’s doctrine of a universal brotherhood, open to all,
constituted the corner-stone of his popularity. He spoke to them in
their own provincial dialect, which could not have differed much from
the Pali of the texts—and he enforced his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> by dialogues, parables,
fables, reiterations, and repetitions. Probably he was the first
introducer of real preaching into India, and by his practical method he
seemed to <span class="t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t27 t29 hoverable">bring</span> down <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> from the clouds to every man’s door.

The following parable is an example: ‘As the peasant sows the seed but
cannot say: the grain shall swell to-day, to-morrow germinate, so also
it is with the disciple; he must obey the precepts, practise meditation,
study the doctrine; he cannot say to-day or to-morrow, I shall be
delivered. Again: as when a herd of deer lives in a forest a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> comes
who opens for them a false path and the deer suffer hurt; and another
comes who opens a safe path and the deer thrive; so when <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> live among
pleasures the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> one comes and opens the false eightfold path. Then
comes the perfect one and opens the safe eightfold path of right belief,
etc.’ (p. 44, Oldenberg, 191, 192).

Six rival heretical teachers are alluded to. His chief opponent was his
cousin Devadatta, who <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> up a school of his own, and is said to have
plotted against the Buddha’s life. His efforts failed (Culla-vagga VII),
and he himself came to an untimely end. Possibly he may have belonged to
the rival Jaina sect (Niga??ha) of naked ascetics, of which the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>
leader was Vardhamana Mahavira Nata-putta (=Jñati-putra).

Gautama’s teaching gained the day. It claimed universality, and was
aptly symbolized by a wheel rolling among all alike. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> at first it had
no attractions for the poor and the child-like.

By degrees, a fuller system, adapted in an ascending scale to laymen,
novices, monks, nuns, and Arhats, was developed—a system which had its
abstruse doctrines suited to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> of philosophical minds, as <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as its
plain practical side. This constituted the Buddhist Dharma, which was
ultimately collected in certain sacred books to be next described.




                              LECTURE III.
         _The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Law</span> (Dharma) and Sacred Scriptures of Buddhism._


Probably most educated persons are aware that Buddhists have their own
sacred scriptures, like Hindus, Parsis, Confucianists, Muhammadans,
Jews, and Christians. It is not, however, so generally known that in one
important particular these Buddhist scriptures, constituting the
Tri-pi?aka (p. 61), differ wholly from other sacred books. They lay no
claim to supernatural inspiration. Whatever doctrine is found in them
was believed to be purely human—that is, was held to be the product of
man’s own natural faculties working naturally.

The Tri-pi?aka was never like the Veda of the Brahmans, believed to be
the very ‘breath of God’[19]; the same care, therefore, was not <span class="t2 t5 t11 t18 t19 t23 t26 hoverable">taken</span> to
preserve every sound; and when at last it was <span class="t2 t11 t15 t19 t25 t27 hoverable">written</span> down the result
was a more scholastic production than the Veda.

Moreover, it was not composed in the Sansk?it of the Veda and ?astras—in
the sacred language, the very grammar and alphabet of which were
supposed to come from heaven—but in the vernacular of the part of India
in which Buddhism flourished. Indeed, it is a significant <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> that
while the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> sages of Sansk?it literature and philosophy, such as
Vyasa, Kumarila, and ?a?kara, in all probability spoke and taught in
Sansk?it[20], the Founder of Buddhism preferred to communicate his
precepts to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> in their own vernacular, afterwards <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Pali.
Nevertheless, he never composed a single <span class="t6 t8 t10 t11 t16 t20 t21 t27 t28 hoverable">book</span> of his own. In all
probability he never wrote down any of his own precepts; for if writing
was then invented, it was little practised, through the absence of
suitable materials. This is the more remarkable as Buddhism ultimately
became an instrument for introducing literary culture among uncivilized
races.

All that Gautama did was to preach his Dharma, ‘Law,’ during forty-five
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> of itineration, and oral teaching. It was not till some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> after
his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> that his sayings were collected (p. 97), and still longer
before they were <span class="t2 t11 t15 t19 t25 t27 hoverable">written</span> down. Itineration, recitation of the Law, and
preaching were the chief instruments for the propagation of Buddhism.

At present the Buddhist Canon is about as extensive as the
Brahmanical[21], and in both cases we are <span class="t1 t7 t12 t29 hoverable">left</span> in doubt as to the date
when the books were composed. How, then, did their composition <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span>
place?

All that can be said is that at <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> successive epochs after the
Buddha’s death, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> gatherings of his followers were held for the
purpose of collecting his sayings and settling the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> Canon, and that
a fourth assembly <span class="t2 t4 t6 t9 t18 t19 t22 hoverable">took</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> much later in the North.

The first of these assemblages can scarcely with any fitness be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> a
Council. Nor can the <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> of its meeting <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> in any formal manner
be established on any trustworthy historical basis. It is said that a
<span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span> of monks (about five hundred, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Maha-sthavira?, ‘the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>
elders,’ Pali Maha-thera) assembled in a cave <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Sattapa??i, near
the then capital <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">city</span> of Magadha—Raja-g?iha, now Raj-gir—under the
sanction of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> Ajata-?atru, during the rainy season immediately
succeeding the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> of Gautama, to think over, put together, and
arrange the sayings of their Master, but not, so far as we know, to
write them down.

There, in all likelihood, they made the first step towards a methodical
arrangement. But even then it is doubtful <span class="t0 t5 t8 t10 t14 t15 t21 t24 t28 hoverable">whether</span> any systematic
collections were composed. The assembled monks chose Ka?yapa (or
Maha-ka?yapa, p. 47), the most esteemed of all the Buddha’s surviving
disciples, as their leader, and chanted the Thera-vada (Sthavira-v°),
‘words of the elders,’ or precepts of their Founder preserved in the
memory of the older men; the rules of discipline (Vinaya) being recited
by Upali[22], and the ethical precepts (Sutra), which constituted at
first the principal Dharma[23] (_par excellence_, in contradistinction
to the Vinaya), being imparted by Gautama’s favorite Ananda (p. 47);
while the philosophical doctrines—then undeveloped—were communicated by
the president, Ka?yapa. If any arrangement was then made it was probably
in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> collections—the Vinaya and Dharma (say about 400 B.C.)

In regard to the Dharma, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> main lines were, in all likelihood, laid
down as the basis of all early teaching. The first consisted of the four
sublime verities, as they are called—that is, of the four fundamental
truths originally taught by the Founder of Buddhism, namely, the
inevitable inherence of suffering in every <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of life, the connexion
of all suffering with indulgence of desires, especially with craving for
continuity of existence, the possibility of the cessation of suffering
by restraining lusts and desires, and the eightfold course leading to
that cessation (see p. 44).

The <span class="t0 t2 t5 t13 t14 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">second</span> line of doctrine probably consisted of an outline of the
twelve-linked chain of causality (nidana), which traced back all
suffering to a still deeper origin than mere lusts and desires—namely,
to ignorance (p. 103).

It is not, however, at all likely that any philosophical or metaphysical
doctrines were clearly and methodically formulated at the earliest
assembly which <span class="t2 t4 t6 t9 t18 t19 t22 hoverable">took</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> soon after Gautama’s death. It is far more
probable that the first outcome of the gathering <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> of the
Buddha’s disciples was simply the enforcing of some strict rules of
discipline for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Order</span> of monks, and this may have <span class="t2 t5 t11 t18 t19 t23 t26 hoverable">taken</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> soon
after 400 B.C.

After a time, certain relaxations of these rules or unauthorized
departures from them (ten in number, such as reception of money-gifts,
eating a <span class="t0 t2 t5 t13 t14 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">second</span> meal in the afternoon, drinking stimulating beverages,
if pure as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> in appearance[24]), began to be common. The question as
to <span class="t0 t5 t8 t10 t14 t15 t21 t24 t28 hoverable">whether</span> liberty should be allowed in these points, _especially in the
first_, shook the very foundations of the community. In <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span>
<span class="t5 t11 hoverable">society</span> became split up into <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> contending parties, the strict and the
lax, and a <span class="t0 t2 t5 t13 t14 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">second</span> Council became necessary for the restoration of order.
All ten points were discussed at this Council, said to have consisted of
700 monks and held at Vai?ali (Vesali, now Besarh), 27 miles north of
Patna, about 380 B.C.[25] The discussions were protracted for eight
months, and all the ten unlawful relaxations were finally prohibited.

It has been observed that this <span class="t0 t2 t5 t13 t14 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">second</span> Council stands in a relation to
Buddhism very similar to that which the Council of Nicæa bears to
Christianity.

The exact date, however, of either the first or <span class="t0 t2 t5 t13 t14 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">second</span> assemblies cannot
be determined with precision.

Not <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> afterwards occurred the political revolution caused by the
well-known Candra-gupta (= Sandra-kottus)—sometimes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the first
A?oka (or disparagingly, Kala?oka). This man, who was a low-born ?udra,
usurped the throne and founded the Maurya dynasty, after killing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span>
Nanda and taking possession of Pa?aliputra (or Palibothra, now Patna,
the then metropolis of Magadha or Behar), about 315 B.C. He extended the
kingdom of Magadha over all Hindustan, and became so powerful that when
Alexander’s successor, Seleukos Nikator (whose reign commenced about 312
B.C.), invaded India from his kingdom of Bactria, so effectual was the
resistance offered by Candra-gupta, that the Greek <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> it politic to
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> an alliance with the Hindu king, and sent his own countryman,
Megasthenes, as an ambassador to reside at his court.

To this circumstance we owe the earliest authentic <span class="t1 t11 t12 t13 t16 t18 t21 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of Indian
customs and usages, by an intelligent observer who was not a native; and
Megasthenes’ narrative, preserved by Strabo, furnishes a basis on which
a fair inference may be founded that Brahmanism and Buddhism existed
side by side in India on amicable terms in the fourth and <span class="t26 hoverable">third</span>
centuries B.C. There is even ground for believing that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> Candra-gupta
himself favoured the Buddhists, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> outwardly he never renounced his
<span class="t7 t13 t19 t20 t29 hoverable">faith</span> in Brahmanism.

Candra-gupta’s reign is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> to have lasted until 291 B.C., and that
of his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> and successor, Vindusara, from 291 to (say) about 260 B.C.
Then came Candra-gupta’s grandson, the celebrated A?oka (sometimes
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Dharma?oka), who, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> of ?udra origin, was perhaps the
greatest Hindu monarch of India.

It was about this period that Gautama Buddha’s followers began to
develope his doctrines, and to make additions to them in such a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> that
the Abhi-dharma or ‘further Dharma’ had to be added to the ?utra which
constituted the original Dharma (p. 56). Even in Gautama’s <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> there
were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> dissensions. Afterwards differences of opinion increased, so
that before <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> eighteen schools of schismatic <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> (p. 158) were
established. The resulting controversies were very disturbing, and a
<span class="t26 hoverable">third</span> Council became necessary. It consisted of a <span class="t6 hoverable">thousand</span> oldest
members of the Order, and was held in the 16th or 17th year of A?oka’s
reign at Patna (Pa?ali-putra), about 244-242 B.C.

This <span class="t26 hoverable">third</span> Council was, perhaps, the most important; for through its
deliberations the decision was arrived at to propagate Buddhism by
missions. Hence missionaries, supported by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> A?oka (see p. 66), were
sent in all directions; the first being Mahinda (Mahendra), the king’s
son, who carried the doctrine into Ceylon.

Dr. Oldenberg has shown that in a part of the Tri-pi?aka now extant, the
first and <span class="t0 t2 t5 t13 t14 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">second</span> Councils are mentioned but not the third. The plain
inference is that the portion of the Buddhist Canon in which the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t13 t14 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">second</span>
Council is described cannot be older than that Council. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> in all
likelihood a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> part of the Vinaya (including the Patimokkha and the
Khandhaka, p. 62) was composed before the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t13 t14 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">second</span> Council—possibly as
early as about 400 B.C.—and the rest of the Canon during the succeeding
century and a half before the <span class="t26 hoverable">third</span> Council—that is, from 400 to 250
B.C. It was composed in the then vernacular language of Magadha
(Magadhi), where all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> Councils were held.

It seems, however, probable that in each district to which Buddhism
spread the doctrine of its founder was taught in the peculiar dialect
understood by the inhabitants. It even appears likely that when Gautama
himself lived in Kosala (Oudh) he preached in the dialect of that
province just as he taught in Magadhi when he resided in Magadha. The
Culla-vagga (V. 33. I) makes him direct that his precepts should be
learnt by every convert in the provincial dialect, which doubtless
varied slightly everywhere. In <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> it became necessary to give fixity
to the sacred texts, and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> they finally assumed may have
represented the prevalent dialect of the time, and not necessarily the
original Magadhi Prak?it[26]. This final <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of the language was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span>
Pali[27] (or Tanti), and no doubt differs from the earlier A?oka
inscription dialect, and from Magadhi Prak?it as now known.

Some think that the Pali resulted from an artificial infusion of
Sansk?it. It is said that nearly two-fifths of the Pali vocabulary
consists of unmodified Sansk?it.

At any rate, it was in this language that the Buddhist <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Law</span> was carried
(probably by Mahendra) into Ceylon, and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> Canon is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> by
some to have been handed down orally till it was <span class="t2 t11 t15 t19 t25 t27 hoverable">written</span> down there
about 85 B.C. Oral transmission, we know, was common in India, but if
edicts were <span class="t2 t11 t15 t19 t25 t27 hoverable">written</span> by A?oka (p. 67), why should not the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Law</span> have been
<span class="t2 t11 t15 t19 t25 t27 hoverable">written</span> down also?

As, however, Pali was not spoken in Ceylon, the Pali commentaries
<span class="t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> by Mahendra were translated by him into Sinhalese, and the Pali
originals being lost, were not retranslated into Pali till about the
beginning of the fifth century of our era.

Turning next to the final arrangement of the Pali Canon, we <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> that it
resolved itself into <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> collections (called Tri-pi?aka, Pali
Tipi?aka, ‘Three baskets,’ the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> pi?aka, however, not occurring in
the early texts), namely: 1. Yinaya, ‘discipline’ for the Order; 2.
Sutra-(Pali Sutta), ‘precepts,’ which at first constituted the principal
Dharma, or moral <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Law</span> (p. 56); 3. Abhi-dharma (Abhi-dhamma), ‘further
Dharma,’ or additional precepts relative to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">law</span> and philosophy.

This division was not logical, as each collection may treat of the
subjects belonging to the others.

Taking, then, in the first place, the Vinaya or discipline portion of
the Buddhist bible, we ought to observe that a portion of it (the
Patimokkha) is not only the oldest, but also the most important in its
bearing on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> theory of Buddhism. For, as we shall point out more
fully hereafter, the Buddha’s paramount aim was to convince others that
to get rid of ignorance, gain knowledge, practise morality, and obtain
deliverance, it was incumbent on a <span class="t5 t8 hoverable">wise</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> to renounce married <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> and
become a member of a monastic Order.

Pure Buddhism, in fact, was pure monachism—implying celibacy, poverty,
and mendicancy—and this could not be maintained <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> rules for
discipline and outward conduct, which, as adopted by the Buddha, were
simply a modification of the rules for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> religious orders of the
Brahma-cari and Sannyasi, already existing in Brahmanism.

With regard to the classification of the Vinaya rules, they were divided
into <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> sets: _a._ the Khandhaka, in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> collections <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span>

modern summary of the above <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> divisions.

Mark, however, that the Vinaya abounds in details of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> and

ethical doctrines which at first constituted the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> Buddhist Law. It
consists of five Nikayas, or collections, viz. _a._ the Digha, or
collection of 34 <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> suttas, among which is the Maha-parinibbana-sutta
(one of the oldest parts of the Canon after the Patimokkha); _b._ the
Majjhima, or collection of 152 suttas of middling length; _c._ the
Sa?yutta, or collection of 55 groups of joined suttas, some of them very
short; _d._ the A?guttara, or miscellaneous suttas in divisions, which
go on increasing by one (a?ga); _e._ the Khuddaka, or minor collection,
consisting of fifteen works.

According to one school, this fifth Nikaya is more correctly referred to
the Abhi-dhamma Pi?aka. In character, however, it conforms more to the
Sutta. Of its fifteen works, perhaps the most important are the
following six:—

The Khuddaka-pa?ha, ‘short readings;’ the Dhamma-pada, ‘precepts of the
Law’ (or ‘verses of the Law,’ or ‘footsteps of the Law’); the Jataka
(with their commentaries), a series of stories relating to about 550[28]
previous births of the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> (p. 111), which have formed the basis of
many stories in the Pañca-tantra, fables of Æsop, etc.; the
Sutta-nipata, ‘collection of discourses;’ the Thera-gatha ( =
Sthavira-g°), ‘verses or stanzas by elder monks;’ Theri-gatha, ‘verses
by elder nuns.’

The other nine are the Udana, containing 82 short suttas and joyous
utterances of the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> at crises of his life; the Itivuttaka, ‘thus it
was said’ ( = ity ukta), 110 sayings of the Buddha; the Vimana-vatthu,
on the mansions of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> (which move about at will and sometimes
descend on earth); the Peta-vatthu ( = Preta-vastu, Peta standing for
Preta and Pit?i), on departed spirits; the Niddesa, a commentary on the
Sutta-nipata; the Pa?i-sambhida, on the supernatural <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of
Arhats; the Apadana (Sansk?it Avadana), ‘stories about the achievements’
of Arhats; the Buddha-va?sa, or history of the 24 preceding Buddhas (the
Digha mentions only six) and of Gautama; the Cariya-pi?aka, ‘treasury of
acts,’ giving stories based on the Jatakas, describing Gautama’s
acquisition of the ten transcendent virtues (p. 128) in former births.

The <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t7 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">works</span> included in this Sutta-pi?aka frequently <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of
conversations on doctrine and morality, between Gautama, or one of his
chief disciples, and some inquirer. As constituting the ethical Dharma,
they are the most interesting portion of the Canon.

With regard to the <span class="t26 hoverable">third</span> Pi?aka, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Abhi-dhamma (Abbhi-dharma,
‘further dharma’), which is held by modern scholars to be of later

works[29]. Moreover, it was once <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> to relate entirely to
metaphysics and philosophy; but this is now held to be an error, for all

and ethics. Metaphysical discussions occur, but it is probable that
originally <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> kept clear of metaphysics (see p. 98).

Besides the numerous <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t7 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">works</span> we have <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> described as constituting the

doctrine <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Visuddhi-magga, ‘path of purity,’ and a commentary on

was instrumental in spreading Buddhism throughout Burma.

It may be noted that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> important Pali works, Maha-va??a and
Dipa-va??a (Dvipa-va??a), perhaps the oldest extant histories of Ceylon,
are also fairly authentic sources for Buddhistic history before Christ.

Turn we now to the Mahayana or ‘Great Vehicle.’ This cannot be said to
possess any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> Canon distinct from the Tri-pi?aka, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> certain

To understand this part of the subject we must revert to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span>
A?oka. It is usual to <span class="t8 t13 t21 hoverable">call</span> this <span class="t0 t2 t5 t13 t14 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">second</span> and more celebrated A?oka the
Constantine of Buddhism. Being of ?udra origin he was the more inclined
to favour the popular teaching of Gautama, and, as he was the first <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span>
who adopted Buddhism openly (about 257 B.C.) he doubtless did for
Buddhism very much what Constantine did for Christianity.

The Buddhist system then spread over the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> kingdom of A?oka, and
thence over other portions of India, and even to some outlying
countries. For gradually during this period most of the petty princes of
India, from Peshawar and Kashmir to the river Kistna, and from Surat to
Bengal and Orissa, if not actually <span class="t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> under subjection to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span>
of Magadha, were compelled to acknowledge his paramount authority.

This is proved by A?oka’s edicts, which are inscribed on rocks and stone
pillars[32] (the earliest dating from about 251 B.C.), and are found in
frontier districts separated from each other by enormous distances.

These inscriptions are of the greatest interest and value, as furnishing
the first authentic records of Indian history. They are <span class="t2 t11 t15 t19 t25 t27 hoverable">written</span> in a
more <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> language than the Pali of Ceylon, and in at least <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span>
different dialects. Ten of the most important are found on six rocks and
five pillars (La?s), <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> numerous other monuments are scattered over

Vindhya range on the south to the Khaibar <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t11 t12 t19 t22 hoverable">Pass</span> on the north[33].

In these proclamations and edicts (one of which was addressed to the
<span class="t26 hoverable">third</span> Buddhist Council), <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> A?oka, who calls himself Priya-dar?i (Pali

appoints missionaries for the propagation of Buddhist doctrines,
inculcates peace and mercy, charity and toleration, morality and
self-denial, and what is still more remarkable, enjoins quinquennial
periods of national humiliation and confession of sins by all classes,
accompanied by a re-proclamation of the Buddha’s precepts. A?oka, in
fact, became so zealous a friend of Buddhism, that he is said to have
maintained 64,000 Buddhist monks in and around the country of Magadha,
which was on that <span class="t1 t11 t12 t13 t16 t18 t21 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">land</span> of monasteries (Vihara = the
modern Bihar or Behar).

No doubt it was A?oka’s propagation of Buddhism by missions in various
countries—where it came in contact with and partly adopted various
already existing indigenous faiths and superstitions—that led to the
ultimate separation of the Buddhist system into the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> divisions
of Southern and Northern.

Indeed, the formation of a Northern School, as distinct from a Southern,
became inevitable after the conversion of Kanishka, the Indo-Scythian
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> of Kashmir, who came from the North, and became a zealous Buddhist.
He probably reigned in the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t13 t14 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">second</span> half of the first century (A.D.), and
extended his dominions as far as Gujarat, Sindh, and even Mathura (see
p. 167, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">note</span> 2).

It was during Kanishka’s reign that a fourth Council[34] was held at
Jalandhara in Kashmir, under Par?va and Vasu-mitra. It consisted of 500
monks, who composed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> Sansk?it <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t7 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">works</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of commentaries
(Upade?a, Vinaya-vibhasha, Abhidharma-vibhasha) on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> Pali
Pi?akas. These were the earliest books of the Maha-yana or Northern
School, which afterwards formulated its more developed doctrines on the
Indus, while the Pali Canon of the South represented the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> doctrine
promulgated on the Ganges.

Kashmir was a centre of Sansk?it learning, and Kanishka, who was a
patron of it, became to Northern Buddhism what A?oka had been to
Southern. Hence in process of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> other Northern Buddhist books were
<span class="t2 t11 t15 t19 t25 t27 hoverable">written</span> in Sansk?it, with occasional Gathas or stanzas in an irregular
dialect, half Sansk?it, half Prak?it.

It is usual to enumerate nine Nepalese canonical scriptures
(Dharmas):—1.Prajña paramita, ‘transcendent knowledge,’ or an abstract
of metaphysical and mystic philosophy; 2. Ga??a-vyuha; 3.
Da?a-bhumi?-vara (describing the ten stages leading to Buddhahood); 4.
Samadhi-raja; 5. La?kavatara; 6. Saddharma-pu??arika, ‘Lotus of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">True</span>

Lalita-vistara (giving a legendary <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of Buddha); 9. Suvar?a-prabhasa.
The eighth is probably as old as the 2nd century of our era, and next
comes the sixth. Tibetan translations were made of all of them. These
extend to 100 volumes and are collectively <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Ka’gyur or Kan’gyur

traveller, Alexander Csoma de Körös.

Copies of the Sanskrit <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t7 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">works</span> were <span class="t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> to England by Mr. B. H.
Hodgson. The sixth has been translated by Burnouf and recently by H.
Kern. Dr. Rajendralala-mitra has edited the eighth. As to the

Professor E. B. Cowell and Mr. R. A. Neil, the Divyavadana. They contain
interesting old legends—some about the achievements of A?oka, some about
<span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> himself, some perhaps from lost Vinaya books.

As to the Pali <span class="t2 t11 t15 t19 t25 t27 hoverable">written</span> character, it is a question <span class="t0 t5 t8 t10 t14 t15 t21 t24 t28 hoverable">whether</span> that current

Burma—that is, Devanagari, Sinhalese, Kambodian, or Burmese—should be
used. Many think Burmese most suited to it, and in Europe the Roman
character is preferred.

It should be added that the recitation (Bha?a, Sansk?it root Bha?, ‘to
speak;’ in Sinhalese spelt Ba?a) of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Law</span> is one of the principal
duties of monks, the reciter being <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Bha?aka. A peculiar mode of
intoning is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Sara-bhañña (sara = svara). The Buddha, they say, is
not extinct, for he lives in the Dharma and in the Sa?gha, in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Law</span>
and in the monks who recite it. Hence the importance of recitation in
the Buddhist system (p. 84).




                              LECTURE IV.
                _The Sa?gha or Buddhist <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Order</span> of Monks._


Perhaps the first point made clear by the study of the Buddhist
Scriptures is, that the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> never seriously <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> of founding a new
system in direct opposition to Brahmanism and caste. Even his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Order</span> or
fraternity of Monks, which attained a world-wide celebrity and spread
through a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> part of Asia, was a mere imitation of an institution
already established in India. He himself was a Hindu of the Hindus, and
he remained a Hindu to the end. His very name, Gautama, connected him
with one of the most celebrated Hindu sages, and was significant of his
original connexion with orthodox Brahmanism. It is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> he was a
determined opponent of all Brahmanical sacerdotalism and ceremonialism,
and of all theories about the supernatural character of the Vedas (see
p. 53); but, being himself a Hindu, he never required his adherents to
make any formal renunciation of Hinduism, as if they had been converted
to an entirely new faith; just as, if I may say so with all reverence,
the Founder of the Christian Church, being Himself a Jew, never required
His followers to give up every Jewish usage.

Nor had the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> any <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> of courting popularity as a champion of
social equality and denouncer of all distinctions of rank and <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span>
traditions—a <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of Tribune of the people, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> mission was to protect
them from the tyranny of the upper classes.

There was, no doubt, at one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> a prevalent opinion among scholars that
Gautama aimed at becoming a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> social reformer. It was generally
supposed that he began by posing before his fellow-countrymen in a
somewhat _ad captandum_ manner as a popular leader and liberator, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span>
mission was to deliver them from the tyranny of caste. But such an
opinion is now known to be based on mistaken assumptions. What ought
rather to be claimed for him is that he was the first to establish a
universal brotherhood (Sa?gha) of cœnobite monks, open to all persons of
all ranks. In other words, he was the first founder of what may be
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> a <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of universal monastic communism (for Buddhist monks never,
as a rule, lived alone), and the first to affirm that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span>
enlightenment—the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t22 t23 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">highest</span> path leading to saintship—was
not confined to the Brahmans, but open to all the members of all castes.
This was the only <span class="t0 t1 t7 t12 t13 t14 t17 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">sense</span> in which he abolished caste. His <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> followers,
however, constituted a caste of their own, distinguished from the laity.
From the want of a more suitable term we are forced to <span class="t8 t13 t21 hoverable">call</span> them
‘monks[35].’

And this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Order</span> of monks was not a hierarchy. It had no ecclesiastical
organization under any centralized authority. Its first Head, Gautama,
appointed no successor. It was not the depository of theological
learning. Nor was it a mediatorial caste of priests, claiming to mediate

all were under certain obligations of celibacy, moral restraint,
fasting, poverty, itineration and confession to each other—all were
dominated by one idea, and pledged to the propagation of the one
doctrine, that all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> was in itself misery, and to be got rid of by a

brotherhood of this <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> which made personal extinction its final aim,
and might be co-extensive with the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> world, was the Buddha’s
principal object.

In point of fact, the so-called enlightenment of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> which entitled him
to Buddhahood, led him at the early stage of his career into no abstruse
or transcendental region of thought, but <span class="t2 t4 t6 t9 t18 t19 t22 hoverable">took</span> a very practical
direction. It led him to see that an association of monks <span class="t6 hoverable">offering</span>
equality of condition to <span class="t17 t29 hoverable">high</span> and low, rich and poor, and a haven of
refuge to all oppressed by the troubles of life, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> soon become

original members (see p. 45), but its growth soon surpassed all
anticipations, and its ramifications extended to distant countries,
where, like the branches of the Indian fig-tree, they sent down roots to

In brief, a carefully regulated monastic brotherhood, which opened its
arms to all comers of all ranks, and enforced on its members the duty of
extending its boundaries by itinerancy, and by constantly rolling onward

the very essence, the very backbone of Buddhism, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> which it could
never have been propagated, nor even have held its own.

But we repeat that in this, his main design, Gautama was after all no
innovator; no introducer of novel ideas.

Monachism had always been a favourite adjunct of the Brahminanical
system, and respect for monastic <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> had <span class="t2 t5 t11 t18 t19 t23 t26 hoverable">taken</span> deep root among the

become a Sannyasi, ‘ascetic,’ or Bhikshu, ‘mendicant,’ wandering from
door to door. In fact, it was through these very states of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> that
Gautama himself, as a Kshatriya, was theoretically bound to have passed.

Hindu monks, therefore, were numerous before Buddhism. They belonged to
various sects, and <span class="t2 t4 t6 t9 t18 t19 t22 hoverable">took</span> various vows of self-torture, of silence, of
fasting, of poverty, of mendicancy, of celibacy, of abandoning caste,
rank, wife and family. Accordingly they had various names. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span>

Vairagi, ‘free from affections;’ Yogi, ‘seeking mystic union with the

austerities;’ Yati, ‘restraining desires;’ Jitendriya, ‘conquering
passions;’ ?rama?a, ‘undergoing discipline;’ Bhikshu, ‘living by alms;’
Nirgrantha, ‘without ties.’ Such names prove that asceticism was an
<span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> institution. The peculiarity about Gautama’s teaching in regard
to monachism was that he discouraged[36] solitary asceticism, severe
austerities, and irrevocable vows, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> he enjoined moral restraint in
celibate fraternities, conformity to rules of discipline, upright
conduct, and confession to each other.

                             the Preface).

His usual mode of designating his monks was by the old term Bhikshu
(Pali Bhikkhu), ‘living by alms,’ to indicate their poverty. They were
also <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> ?rama?era and ?rama?a (Pali Sama?era, Sama?a), as subject to
monastic discipline[37]. Those who entered the stream leading to
Arhatship (p. 132) were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Arya.

The term ?ravaka, ‘hearers,’ seems to have been <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">used</span> in the Hina-yana
system to denote <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> disciples only, and especially those ‘great
disciples’ (p. 47) of Gautama who <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t18 hoverable">heard</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Law</span> from his own lips, and
were afterwards <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Sthaviras and became Arhats (p. 133). They had
also the title Ayushmat, ‘possessing life.’

We perceive again the close connexion between Brahmanism and Buddhism;
for clearly the Brahma-cari and Sannyasi of the one became the ?rama?era
or junior monk, and ?rama?a or senior monk of the other.

As to the name ?rama?a (from root ?ram, ‘to toil’), bear in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> that,
although Buddhism has acquired the credit of being the easiest religious
system in the world, and its monks are among the idlest of men—as having
no laborious ceremonies and no <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> to do for a livelihood—yet in
reality the carrying out of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> <span class="t24 t25 hoverable">object</span> of extinguishing lusts, and
so getting rid of the burden of repeated existences, was no sinecure if
earnestly undertaken. Nor was it possible for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> to lead sedentary

As to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of admission, there was no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> strictness in early
times, when all applicants were admitted <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> inquiry. It was only
when the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Order</span> increased that murderers, robbers, debtors, soldiers and
others in the King’s service, lepers, cripples, blind, one-eyed, deaf
and dumb, and consumptive persons, and all subject to fits were
rejected[38].

Originally it was enough for the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> to have said, ‘Come (ehi),
follow me.’ This alone conferred discipleship. In time, however, he
commissioned those he had himself admitted to admit others. Then the

The youthful layman who desired admission to the first degree, or that
of a novice, had to be at least fifteen <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> old[39] (Maha-v° I. 50);

  ‘I go for refuge to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Order</span> (Sa?gha? ?ara?a? gacchami).’

Very remarkably, this, the only prayer of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> Buddhism, resembled the
Gayatri or sacred prayer of the Veda (repeated by the Brahma-cari) in
consisting of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> times eight syllables. But if the Buddhist novice
had a right to the Brahma-cari’s sacred cord (upavita), this was
probably abandoned on admission. He was then instructed in the Ten
Precepts (Dasa-sila or sikkha-pada), which were really ten prohibitions
(Maha-vagga I. 56), requiring ten abstinences (verama?i):—

1. from destroying <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> (pa?atipato = pra?atipata); 2. from taking
anything not given (adinnadana); 3. from unchastity (abrahmacariya); 4.
from speaking falsely (musa-vada = m?isha-vada); 5. from drinking strong
drinks (sura); 6. from eating at forbidden times (vikala-bhojana); 7.
from dancing, singing, music, and worldly spectacles (visuka); 8. from
garlands, scents, unguents or ornaments; 9. from the <span class="t1 hoverable">use</span> of a <span class="t17 t29 hoverable">high</span> or
broad bed; 10. from receiving gold or silver. The prohibition not to
receive money, even in return for religious teaching or any supposed
<span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> benefits conferred, was held to be most important, and was for
a <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> obeyed, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> in the end monasteries became owners of large
property and landed estates.

Of course the Upasampada, or admission to <span class="t10 t16 hoverable">full</span> monkhood (described
Maha-vagga I. 76), was a more formal ceremony. A conclave (Sa?gha) of at
least ten monks was required. The candidate had to appear before them,
but was first instructed by some competent and learned monk as to the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of the rite and the questions he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have to answer. This
instructor also directed him to choose some other monk competent to act
as his Upadhyaya (upajjhaya) or teacher for five <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> after his
admission, and made him provide himself with an alms-bowl and with the
usual yellow monkish vestments. Then his first instructor presented
himself before the conclave and informed them that the candidate was
ready to be admitted. Thereupon the novice came forward, adjusted his
upper garment so as to cover the <span class="t1 t7 t12 t29 hoverable">left</span> shoulder, bowed down before the
feet of the assembled monks, seated himself on the ground, and, raising
his joined hands, asked <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> times for admission to the <span class="t10 t16 hoverable">full</span> monkhood,
thus:—‘I entreat the Sa?gha for <span class="t10 t16 hoverable">full</span> monkhood (Upasampada), have
compassion on me and uproot me (ullumpatu mam) from the world,’ repeated
thrice.

Thereupon he was questioned [not, as in our Ordination Service: ‘Are you
inwardly moved by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">Holy</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Spirit</span> to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> you this office?’ Not:
‘Will you apply all your diligence to frame and fashion your own <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span>
and that of your family so as to be wholesome examples?’ but] thus:—Are
you <span class="t1 t8 hoverable">free</span> from leprosy, boils, consumption, fits, etc. Are you a male?
Are you a <span class="t1 t8 hoverable">free</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> and not in the royal service? Are you <span class="t1 t8 hoverable">free</span> from
debts? Have you the consent of your parents? Are you <span class="t10 t16 hoverable">full</span> twenty <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span>
old? Have you an alms-bowl and vestments? What is your name? What is
your teacher’s name?

If the answers were satisfactory the candidate was admitted. After
admission no prayer was pronounced [such as in our Ordination Service:
‘We beseech Thee, merciful Father, send on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thy</span> servant <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thy</span> heavenly
blessing that he may be clothed with righteousness’[40]]; but he was
informed that he was to trust to only four Resources (nissaya), and to
abstain from four chief forbidden acts (akara?iyani). These four
Resources and four Prohibitions were then communicated to him thus:—

First the four Resources as follow:—(1) Broken morsels given in alms for
food; (2) Rags from a dust-heap for clothes; (3) Roots of trees for an
abode; (4) Liquid putrefying excreta of cows for medicine. Note,
however, that, in practice, indulgences (atirekha-labha) were in all
four cases allowed; such as, better <span class="t0 t14 t23 t24 hoverable">food</span> when it happened to be given,
or when invited to dinner by rich laymen; linen, cotton, or woollen
garments, if dyed yellow and in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> pieces (but only one change was
allowed); houses, huts, or caves to dwell in, when not itinerating;
ghee, honey, or molasses when out of health (Maha-v° I. 30. 4).

Next the four chief Prohibitions (compare the Ten Prohibitions, p. 78),
viz.:—(1) Unchastity and sexual acts of any kind; (2) Taking anything
not given, even a blade of grass; (3) Killing any living thing, even an
ant, or worm, or plant; (4) Falsely claiming the extraordinary powers of
a perfected saint (uttarimanussa-dhamma. Maha-v° I. 78. 2).

Clearly there were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> temptations to gain celebrity by claiming such
powers, or else this fourth prohibition <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> not have terminated the
ceremony.

So soon as a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> was admitted to <span class="t10 t16 hoverable">full</span> monkhood, he <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> through a five
years’ course of instruction in the entire doctrine and discipline,
under the preceptor (Upadhyaya, Acarya) who had been previously chosen
and was required to be of at least ten years’ standing.

This was a modification of the Brahmanical rule that a student
(Brahma-cari) should study under his preceptor for thirty-six years, or
less, until he knew the Veda.

The <span class="t10 t16 hoverable">full</span> Buddhist monk had in theory to dwell under trees or in huts
formed of leaves (pa?-sala = pa??a-sala = par?a-?ala); but practically
he resided in collections of simple mud or brick tenements, in cells, or
in rows of caves hewn out of rocky hills. At any rate, collections of
monastic dwellings, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Viharas[41], were his usual abode during
Vassa (or the rainy season, see p. 82); and at such times he had
fellow-monks (saddhiviharika) living in companies around him, or in the
same monastery.

Strict discipline was supposed to be enforced, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> there was no
central authority, no Chief Hierarch, no Archbishop whom he was bound
‘reverently to obey.’

Offences against the four forbidden acts were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Parajika apatti,
‘offences meriting expulsion from the community of monks (Sa?gha).’

Then there were thirteen Sa?ghadisesa apatti, as <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as certain Dukkata
or less serious offences, requiring only confession before the Sa?gha,
and dealt with by a Sa?gha-kamma, or act of a conclave of monks imposing
some penance. There were penances (Praya?-citta) for lying,
prevarication, abusive language, destroying vegetable or animal life,
etc. (see Patimokkha, Pacittiya dhamma, and pp. 62, 84). The following
practices were also incumbent on all monks:—

(1) The wearing vestments given by laymen (not purchased) and consisting
of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> lengths of yellow-coloured rags; or, if entire lengths of
cotton cloths were given, the saleable value had to be destroyed by
tearing them into at least <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> pieces, and then sewing them together;
(2) The owning no possessions except the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> cloths, a girdle, bowl,
razor, needle, and water-strainer to prevent the swallowing of
animalculæ; (3) The living only on <span class="t0 t14 t23 t24 hoverable">food</span> collected in a wooden bowl by
daily going from <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> to house, but <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> ever asking for it; (4) The
eating at mid-day the one meal so collected and at no other time; (5)
The fasting on four prescribed days; (6) The abiding in one spot for
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> or four months during Vassa, ‘the rains’ (from middle of June to
middle of October), when itineration <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> involve trampling on
vegetable and insect life; (7) The refraining from a recumbent posture
under all circumstances; (8) The visiting cremation-grounds for
meditation on the corruption of the body.

In <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> it might almost be said that in every movement and action, in
waking and sleeping, in dressing and undressing, in standing and
sitting, in going out and coming in, in fasting and eating, in speaking
and not speaking, the Buddhist monk had to submit to the most stringent
regulations.

It was a noteworthy feature in Buddhist monachism that monks were never
allowed to appear in public in a <span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> of even semi-nudity. ‘Properly
clad,’ says the Sekhiya dhamma (4), ‘must the monk itinerate.’ ‘Not
nakedness,’ says the Dhamma-pada (141), ‘can purify a mortal who has not
overcome desires.’ The monk’s <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> garments (ticivara = tri-civara)
were an inner one (antara-vasaka), another wound about the thighs
(sa?gha?i) and an upper robe (uttarasa?ga) worn loosely and <span class="t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span>
round over the <span class="t1 t7 t12 t29 hoverable">left</span> shoulder. This constituted an important distinction
between the Buddhist monks and the Jaina and other naked ascetics <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span>
want of decency the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> condemned.

The Buddhist monk’s daily <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> probably began by meditation and by his
reciting or intoning (Bha?a, Sarabhañña) portions of the Law, or by
hearing it recited, followed perhaps by lessons in doctrine, or by
discussions or by confessions. Next came itineration for food, followed
by the one noon-day meal. Then came rest and further meditation and
recitation, while possibly the senior monks preached to laymen. Such
preaching <span class="t2 t4 t6 t9 t18 t19 t22 hoverable">took</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> especially during Vassa. In later times the daily
duties included <span class="t6 hoverable">offering</span> flowers, etc., at sacred shrines, and repeating
so-called prayers, which were merely forms of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">used</span> as charms.

To illustrate the immensely meritorious efficacy of constant recitation
of the Law, a story is told of five hundred bats that lived in a cave
where <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> monks daily recited the Dharma. These bats gained such merit
by simply hearing the sound that when they died they were all re-born as
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> and ultimately as gods.

Doubtless quarrels and faults of omission and commission occurred among
the monks, especially during their residence <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> in Vassa
(miscalled the Buddhist Lent). We read of six monks named Chabbaggiya
who were constantly committing offences. Hence a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Pavara?a
(Pravara?a), ‘invitation,’ was kept at the end of Vassa, when all were
invited to assemble for confession and for felicitation, if harmony had
been preserved.

An important part of every monk’s duties was confession on Uposatha
(Upavasatha) or fast-days (miscalled the Buddhist sabbaths)—which were
kept at first on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">days</span> in each month, at <span class="t10 t16 hoverable">full</span> and new moon
(corresponding to the Dar?a and Paur?amasa <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">days</span> of Brahmanism), and
afterwards also at the intermediate <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">days</span> of quarter-moon. On these four
Uposatha <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">days</span> the Patimokkha or general confession (p. 62) was recited.
The confession was by monks to each other, not by laymen to monks,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> the four <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">days</span> were also observed by laymen, and we know that
A?oka enjoined periodical ceremonies, and expression of sorrow for sins
on the part of all his subjects. Such confession did not cause remission
of <span class="t2 t5 t8 t17 t18 t19 hoverable">sin</span> or absolution in our sense, but only release from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span>
consequences by penances (p. 62).

We have learnt, then, that Buddhist monks were not under irrevocable
vows. They undertook to obey rules of discipline, but <span class="t2 t4 t6 t9 t18 t19 t22 hoverable">took</span> no actual
vows—not even of obedience to a superior. Buddhist monkhood was purely
voluntary, so that all were <span class="t1 t8 hoverable">free</span> to come and go. It had nothing
hereditary about it like the rank of a Brahman.

We have also learnt, that the term ‘priest’ is not suitably applied to
Buddhist monks. For <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> Buddhism has no ecclesiastical hierarchy, no
clergy, no priestly ordination; no <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> revelation, no ceremonial
rites, no prayer, no <span class="t0 t5 t11 hoverable">worship</span> in the proper <span class="t0 t1 t7 t12 t13 t14 t17 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">sense</span> of these terms. Each
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> was a priest to himself in so far as he depended on himself alone
for internal sanctification.

Evidently, too, all Buddhist monks were integral parts of one organic
whole. It is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> that in the end they were collected in various
monasteries, each of which practically became an independent Sa?gha
(each under one Head). But in theory all were parts of one and the same
brotherhood, which was republican and communistic in its constitution.
And this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> Sa?gha cannot be correctly rendered by ‘church,’ if by
that term is meant an ecclesiastical <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> with legislative functions,
embracing clergy and _laity_ united in a common <span class="t7 t13 t19 t20 t29 hoverable">faith</span> and under one
Head; for as founded by the Buddha, it was not this. It was simply a
vast fraternity intended to embrace all monks of the four quarters
(caturdi?a) of the world, from the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> himself and the perfected
Arhat (p. 133), to every monk of the lowest degree, but not a single
layman. Indeed in its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t22 t23 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">highest</span> <span class="t0 t1 t7 t12 t13 t14 t17 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">sense</span> the Sa?gha comprised only <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span>
Nirva?a-seeking monks who had entered the paths of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> sanctification
(p. 132).

And here observe that, notwithstanding the stigma attached to unmarried
women in India, Gautama in the end permitted an <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Order</span> of Nuns (Pali
Bhikkhuni) and female novices (Sama?eri, p. 47). The Culla-vagga (X. I.
3) relates how women were indebted to the intercession of a monk,
Gautama’s cousin Ananda, for permission to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> an Order, and how
Maha-prajapati, the Buddha’s nurse (p. 24), became the first nun; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span>
when Ananda first asked: ‘How are we monks to behave when we see women?’
Gautama replied: ‘Don’t see them.’ ‘But if we should see them, what are
we to do?’ ‘Don’t <span class="t6 t9 t11 t19 t20 t22 hoverable">speak</span> to them.’ ‘But if they <span class="t6 t9 t11 t19 t20 t22 hoverable">speak</span> to us, what then?’
‘Let your thoughts be fixed in deep meditation’ (Sati upa??hapetabba.
Maha-parin° V. 23).

Clearly the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> was originally a misogynist as <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as a misogamist,
and wished his followers to be misogynists also. Even when he had been
induced to admit the justice of the plea for women’s rights, he placed
his nuns under the direction of monks. They could only be admitted by
monks, and were subject to the male <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Order</span> in all matters of discipline.
They were under eight special obligations, one of which was to rise up
in the presence of a monk, even if a novice.

The Buddha’s exhortation to the first nun is noteworthy:—‘Whatsoever, O
Gotami (Maha-prajapati), conduces to absence of passion, to absence of
pride, to wishing for little and not for much, to seclusion and not to
<span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> of society, to earnest effort and not to indolence, to contentment
and not to querulousness, verily that is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> doctrine’ (Culla-v° X.
5).

It was certainly a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> gain for a woman when she was permitted to
become a nun (or a Theri); for, as a nun, she could even attain
Arhatship. This is clearly laid down in Culla-vagga X. 1. 3. 4. No
woman, however, could attain to Buddhahood <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> being <span class="t9 t24 hoverable">born</span> as a man,
so that it could scarcely be said that in <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> there is ‘neither male
nor female.’

Such, then, was the monachism which constituted the very pith and marrow
of Buddhism. All truly enlightened disciples of <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> were monks or
nuns.

Let us not forget, however, that in practice Buddhism admitted
lay-brothers, lay-sisters, married householders and working-men, as
necessary adjuncts.

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> they were only appendages. Of course the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> knew very <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> that
it was not possible to enforce celibacy on all his followers. He knew
that having prohibited his monks from making or taking money or holding
property, they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have to depend on lay-associates and householders
for food, clothing, and habitation, and that, if every layman were to
become a monk, there <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be no <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> done, no <span class="t0 t14 t23 t24 hoverable">food</span> produced, no

Universal monkhood, in short, might have been a consummation to be aimed
at in some Utopia; but was practically unattainable. In <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> Gautama had
to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> as he found it, and the very <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span>
perpetuating itself—according to his own theory of a constant succession
of birth, decay, and reproduction—implied that a youth, on reaching
manhood, married, had children, worked and earned a livelihood for their
support. He could not impose this burden on others.

Besides, the generality of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> were in Gautama’s <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> what they are in
India now-a-days—bent on early marriage, and resolute in working hard
for a livelihood. Even Manu only enjoined celibacy on young religious
students and on old men, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> there were occasional cases of perpetual
(naish?hika) Brahma-carins.

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Without</span> doubt, celibacy in instances of extraordinary sanctity has
always commanded respect in India; but in no country of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> has
married <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> been so universally honoured. It is not very likely, then,
that the following sentiments, enunciated by the Buddha, could have met
with general approval:—

‘A <span class="t5 t8 hoverable">wise</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> should avoid married <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> (abrahma-cariyam) as if it were a
burning pit of live coals’ (Dhammika-Sutta 21).

‘Full of hindrances is married life, defiled by passion. How can one who
dwells at home live the <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> in all its purity?’ (Tevijja-Sutta
47).

And in reality Buddha’s anti-matrimonial doctrines _did_ excite
opposition. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> murmured and said, ‘He is come to <span class="t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t27 t29 hoverable">bring</span>
childlessness among us, and widowhood, and destruction of family-life.’
Indeed, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> facts—first, that the foundations of Buddhism were not
laid (as those of Christianity notably are), on the hallowed hearth of
home and on the sacred rock of family-life with its daily round of
honest work; and—secondly, that the precept enjoining monkhood and
abstinence from marriage was not combined with any organized
ecclesiastical hierarchy under a central government, are sufficient to
<span class="t1 t11 t12 t13 t16 t18 t21 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> for the circumstance that Buddhism never gained any real
stability in India.

No doubt lay-brethren were always welcomed; but they were bound to
Buddhism by very slender ties in regard to dogma, and were only expected
to conform to the simplest possible code of morality.

Probably the only <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of admission for a layman was the repetition of
the 24 syllables of the three-refuge (tri-?ara?a) formula:—‘I go for
refuge to the Buddha, his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Law</span> and his Order’ (p. 78). It was of course
understood that he was to abstain from the five gross sins (p. 126), but
he was already bound to do so by the rules of Hindu caste and
family-religion. The chief test of his Buddhism was his readiness to
serve the monks. It was for this reason, I think, that lay-adherents
were not called, as might have been expected, ?ravakas, ‘Hearers,’ but
simply Upasakas, ‘Servers,’ and in the <span class="t5 t16 t21 t24 t25 hoverable">case</span> of women Upasikas. They
could not be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> disciples of <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> in the _truest sense_, unless
they entered his monastic Order.

Of course the majority of Buddhist householders never cared to do this.
Their chief religion consisted in giving <span class="t0 t14 t23 t24 hoverable">food</span> and clothing, earned by
daily toil, to the monks[42]. If they failed in this, there was only one
punishment. They were forbidden the privilege of giving at all, and so
of accumulating a store of merit. No monk was allowed to ask them for a
single thing. Of course, too, the majority of Buddhist householders were
worldly-minded; they were no believers in ultra-pessimistic views of
life. They looked for a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> in some heaven, not Nirva?a. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> in theory
all laymen might enter the paths of sanctification (p. 132), and
thousands of earnest <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> are said to have done so[43].

A layman’s progress, however, towards Arhatship, except through monkhood
and abandoning the world, was almost hopelessly barred. At page 264 of
the Milinda-pañha it is implied that an earnest layman might become an
Arhat, even while still a layman, but he had either to enter monkhood or
else to <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t11 t12 t19 t22 hoverable">pass</span> away in Pari-nirva?a (p. 140) at the moment of becoming so.

The best proof of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> of this <span class="t25 hoverable">view</span> of the matter is, that after a
layman had attached himself to the Buddha, the Law, and the Order, he
was not required to undergo any initiatory ceremony, like baptism, or to
receive any stamp of membership, or to assume a peculiar dress, or to
give up all belief in his family religion, or caste-customs. In short,
he did not as a lay-brother break entirely with Hinduism.

That universal tolerance was of the very essence of Buddhism is
indicated by A?oka’s twelfth edict:—‘The beloved of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> honours all
forms of religious faith—there ought to be reverence for one’s own <span class="t7 t13 t19 t20 t29 hoverable">faith</span>
and no reviling of that of others.’ Compare p. 126.

Nor did Gautama himself ever <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> an example of intolerance. He never
railed at the Brahmans. He treated them with respect, and taught others
to do so; and even adopted the title Brahma?a for his own saints and
Arhats (Dhamma-pada 383-423).

What he opposed was priestcraft and superstition, not Brahmanism; as
indeed other reformers had done before him. Probably the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>
receptivity of Buddhism was one of the causes that led to its decay in
India.

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> Gautama’s victory over one of the most inveterate propensities in
<span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> nature—the tendency to seek salvation through a mediatorial caste
of priests—was a wonderful achievement. This is proved by the <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> that
his followers in other countries became re-entangled in a network of
priestcraft, even more enslaving than that out of which he had rescued
them.

Koeppen, Rhys Davids, and other writers have <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> shown that the
Buddhism of Tibet, with its Pope-like grand Lamas—its cardinals and
abbots, monks and mendicant friars, nuns and novices, canonized saints
and angelic hosts, temples and costly shrines, monasteries and
nunneries, images and pictures, altars and relics, robes and mitres,
rosaries and consecrated water, litanies and chants, processions and
pilgrimages, confessions and penances, bell-ringing and incense—is in
everything, except doctrine, almost a counterpart of the Romish system.
How little could the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> have foreseen such a development of his
brotherhood of monks, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> chief duties were meditation and
itineration!

And what is to be said of the present condition of the Buddhist
monkhood? Do we see anywhere evidences of that enlightenment of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span>
which Buddhism claims as its chief characteristic?

When I was travelling in Ceylon, I met a few learned monks, but the
majority seemed to me idle, ignorant, and indifferent.

In Burma the monks are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Pungis (Phongies), and are a little more
active. Every youth in Burma is supposed for a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> to inhabit a
monastery.

In Tibet the monks are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Lamas (a lower title being Gelong) and
constitute a large proportion of the population. They are slaves to
gross superstitions. Some are mere devil-charmers, a belief in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span>
of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> spirits being the chief religion of the people.

In China the monks are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Ho-shang (or Ho-sang). They constitute the
only section of the population who have a right to be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Buddhists,
though, after all, they are mere pseudo-Buddhists. Professor Legge
informs me that he has known a few learned <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> among them, and learned
<span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t7 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">works</span> have been <span class="t2 t11 t15 t19 t25 t27 hoverable">written</span> by them. But the general testimony of Europeans
in China is that the mass of the monks there are simply drones, or
aimless dreamers, who go through their repetitions by rote. Almost all
are conspicuous for apathy, inertness, and a vacant idiotic expression
of countenance.

Clearly we have in their condition an example of the <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> that even
moral restraint, if carried to the extreme of extinguishing all the
natural affections and desires, must inevitably be followed by a
Nemesis. Surely we have in these monkish fraternities an illustration of
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> that any transgression of the laws of nature, common-sense,
and reason—any suppression of the primary instincts of humanity, must in
the end incur the penalty attached to every violation of the <span class="t0 t28 hoverable">eternal</span>
ordinances of God.




                               LECTURE V.
               _The Philosophical Doctrines of Buddhism._


One of the most noteworthy points in the early history of Buddhistic
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> is that while Gautama <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> denied the existence of Brahma as a
personal Creator, and repudiated the Veda and all Vedic sacrifices and
ceremonial observances, he at the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> made the philosophical
teaching of the Brahmans the point of departure for his own peculiar
philosophical teaching.

Another noteworthy point is that while Buddhism was undoubtedly a
modification of philosophical Brahmanism, the latter was also modified
by an interchange with Buddhistic ideas.

It may certainly be questioned <span class="t0 t5 t8 t10 t14 t15 t21 t24 t28 hoverable">whether</span> Gautama himself, in the early
stages of his career, ever caused much offence to the most orthodox
Brahmans by the <span class="t1 t8 hoverable">free</span> expression of his opinions. He did not spare either
his criticism or sarcasm, but it is <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> known that the Brahmans were
not only tolerant of criticism; they were equally critical themselves,
and delighted in controversial discussions, as they do to this day.

In the Tevijja-Sutta an <span class="t1 t11 t12 t13 t16 t18 t21 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> is given of a discussion in which,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> Gautama expressed himself strongly, he does not seem to have
excited any wrath in his opponent—a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> named Vasettha.

The argument attributed to the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> is so remarkable that a portion of
it may be given here:—

‘Then you say, Vasettha, that not one of the Brahmans, or of their
teachers, or of their pupils, even up to the seventh generation, has
ever seen <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> (the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> of the Brahmans) <span class="t3 hoverable">face</span> to face. And that even
the ?ishis of old, the utterers of the <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> verses, which the
Brahmans of to-day so carefully intone and recite precisely as they have
been handed down—even they did not pretend to know or to have seen where
or whence or whither <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> is. So that the Brahmans versed in the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> Vedas have forsooth said thus: “To a <span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> of union with that
which we know not and have not seen, we can show the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> and can say:
‘This is the straight path, this is the direct <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> which leads him who
acts according to it, into a <span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> of union with Brahman[44].’”

‘Now what think you, Vasettha? Does it not follow, this being so, that
the talk of the Brahmans, versed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> they be in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> Vedas, is
foolish talk?

‘Verily, Vasettha, that Brahmans versed in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> Vedas should be
able to show the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> to a <span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> of union with that which they do not
know, neither have seen—such a condition of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> has no existence.

‘As when a string of blind <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> are clinging one to the other, neither
can the foremost see, nor can the middle one see, nor can the hindmost
see, just so is the talk of the Brahmans versed in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> Vedas[44].’

These no doubt were trenchant words, but it might easily be shown that
the Brahmans themselves did not scruple to <span class="t1 hoverable">use</span> almost as strong language
against their own revelation. For instance, the Chandogya Upanishad (p.
473) speaks of the Veda as ‘mere name’ (nama eva). The B?ihadara?yaka
Upanishad declares that when a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> is in a condition of knowledge, ‘the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> are no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> to him, and the Veda no Veda;’ and the Mu??aka
describes the sacrificial Veda as inferior to Brahma-vidya.

And in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> every Hindu was allowed to choose one of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> ways of
securing his own salvation.

The first was ‘the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> of works’ (Karma-marga), that is to say, of
sacrifices (Yajña), of ceremonial rites, of lustral washings, penances
and pilgrimages, as enjoined in the Mantra and Brahma?a portion of the
Veda, in Manu, the Law-books and parts of the Pura?as.

The <span class="t0 t2 t5 t13 t14 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">second</span> was ‘the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> of faith’ (bhakti), <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> by that term
devotion to one or other of certain commonly worshipped personal
deities,—a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> leading in later times to the <span class="t0 t5 t11 hoverable">worship</span> of ?iva and Vish?u
(unfolded in the Pura?as), and involving merely heart-devotion, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span>
sacrificial or ceremonial acts.

The <span class="t26 hoverable">third</span> was ‘the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> of knowledge’ (Jñana), as <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> forth in the
Upanishads.

The mediæval <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> Kumarila—a really historical teacher—advocated the
first way; another teacher of less note, ?a??ilya, advocated the second;
another celebrated historical teacher, ?a?kara, advocated the third.

Even in Gautama’s <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> any one of these ways or all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> might
be chosen, so <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> as the authority of the Brahmans was not impugned.

This, at least, is the general teaching of the Bhagavad-gita—an eclectic
<span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> which is the most popular exponent of the Hindu creed[45].

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> even the Author of the Bhagavad-gita had a preference for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> of
knowledge. In one <span class="t28 hoverable">passage</span> (II. 42) he describes the Veda as ‘mere
flowery doctrine’ (pushpita vac), and is careful to point out that <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t7 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">works</span>
must be performed as acts of devotion leading to absorption into the
Supreme (Brahma-nirva?am).

Indeed there can be no doubt that it was generally held by the Brahmans
of Buddha’s <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> was the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t22 t23 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">highest</span> way. But this
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> was not open to all. It was reserved for the privileged few—for the
more intellectual and philosophically-minded Brahmans. The generality of
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> had to content themselves with the first and <span class="t0 t2 t5 t13 t14 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">second</span> ways.

What the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> then did was this:—First he stretched out the right <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span>
of brotherhood to all mankind by inviting all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> exception to join
his fraternity of celibate monks, which he wished to be co-extensive
with the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> itself. Then he abolished the first and <span class="t0 t2 t5 t13 t14 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">second</span> ways of
salvation (p. 95), that is, Yajña, ‘sacrifices,’ and Bhakti, ‘devotion
to personal gods,’ and substituted for these meditation and moral
conduct as the only road to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> and emancipation. And then,
lastly, he threw open this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t22 t23 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">highest</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> to all who

might be, not excepting the most degraded.

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Without</span> doubt the distinguishing feature in the Buddha’s gospel was that
no living being, not even the lowest, was to be shut out from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span>
enlightenment.

And here it will be necessary to inquire more closely into the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of
that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> which the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> made accessible to every creature
in the universe.

Was it some deep mystery? Some occult doctrine of <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> or
metaphysical science? Some startling revelation of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">law</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> never
before imparted to the world? Was the Buddha’s open <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> very different
from the old, well-fenced-off Brahmanical way?

Of one point we may be certain. He was too sensible to cast aside all
<span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> traditions. Nor was he a mere enthusiast claiming to be the sole
possessor of a new secret for regenerating society.

Unhappily, however, we are here met by a difficulty. The <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> never,
like Muhammad, wrote a book, or, so far as we know, a line. He was the
Socrates of India, and we are obliged to trust to the record of his
sayings (see p. 38). Still we have no <span class="t1 t11 t16 t20 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">reason</span> to doubt the genuineness of
what was for some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> handed down orally in regard to the doctrines he
taught, and we are struck with the <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> that Gautama <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> his own
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> _Bodhi_ (from _budh_, ‘to understand’), and not _Veda_ (from
_vid_, ‘to know’). Probably by doing so he wished to imply that his own
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> was attainable by all through their own intuitions, inner
consciousness, and self-enlightening intellect, and was to be
distinguished from _Veda_ or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> obtainable through the Brahmans
alone, and by them through supernatural revelation only. Hence, too, he
gave to every being destined to become a <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> the title Bodhi-sattva
(Bodhi-satta), ‘one having <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> derived from _self-enlightening
intellect_ for his essence.’

But it should be noted, that even in the choice of a name derived from
the Sanskrit root _budh_, the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> only adopted the phraseology of the
Sa?khya philosophy and of the Brahma?as. The Sa?khya system made Buddhi,
‘intellect,’ its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> principle (Mahat), and the ?atapatha-brahma?a
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> who had attained to perfect <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of Self
prati-buddha[46]. It may be pointed out, too, that Manu (IV. 204) uses
the same root when he calls his <span class="t5 t8 hoverable">wise</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> Budha.

Moreover, the doctrines which grew out of his own special <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span>
Gautama still <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> _Dharma_ (Dhamma), ‘law,’ using the very same term
employed by the Brahmans—a term expressive of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">law</span> in its most
comprehensive sense, as comprising under it the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> laws of the
Universe, as <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as moral and social duties.

In what, then, did the Buddha’s Dharma differ from that of the Brahmans?
One <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> distinction certainly was that it contained no esoteric
(rahasya) and metaphysical doctrines in regard to matter and spirit,
reserved for the privileged few; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> some of its root-ideas were after
all mere modifications of the Sa?khya, Yoga, and Vedanta systems of
philosophy. His <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> of knowledge, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> it developed into many paths,
had the same point of departure. It was a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of the truth, that
all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> was merely one link in a series of successive existences, and
inseparably bound up with misery. Moreover as there were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> causes of
that misery—lust and ignorance—so there were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> cures.

The first cure was _the suppression of lust and desire_, especially of
all <span class="t0 t10 t11 t17 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">desire</span> for continuity of existence.

The <span class="t0 t2 t5 t13 t14 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">second</span> cure was _the removal of ignorance_. Indeed Ignorance was,
according to Gautama, the first factor in the misery of life, and stands
first in his chain of causation (p. 102). Not, however, the Vedantist’s
ignorance—not ignorance of the <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> and the universe are
identical with God, but ignorance of the four truths of Buddhism (p.
43):—ignorance that all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> is misery, and that the misery of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> is
caused by indulging lusts, and will cease by suppressing them.

It <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be easy to show how all Indian philosophy was a mere scheme for
getting rid of the bugbear of metempsychosis, and how common was the
doctrine that everything is for the worst in the worst of all possible
worlds. This was taught by the Brahmans five centuries B.C., and
continued to be a thoroughly Hindu <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> after the disappearance of
Buddhism. Witness the following from the Maitraya?i Upanishad:—

  In this weak body, ever liable
  To wrath, ambition, avarice, illusion,
  To fear, grief, envy, hatred, separation
  From those we hold most dear, association
  With those we hate; continually exposed
  To hunger, thirst, disease, decrepitude,
  Emaciation, growth, decline and death,
  What relish can there be for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> enjoyment?

Also the following, from Manu (VI. 77):—

  This body, like a <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> composed of the (five) elements, with bones
  for its rafters, tendons for its connecting links, <span class="t6 t20 hoverable">flesh</span> and blood for
  its mortar, skin for its covering; this <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> filled with impurities,
  infested by sorrow and old age, the seat of disease, <span class="t10 t16 hoverable">full</span> of pain and
  passion, and not lasting—a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> ought certainly to abandon.

Also Bhart?i-hari (Vairagya-?ataka III. 32. 50):—

  Enjoyments are alloyed by <span class="t9 t19 hoverable">fear</span> of sickness,
  <span class="t17 t29 hoverable">High</span> rank may have a fall, abundant wealth
  Is subject to exactions, dignity
  Encounters risk of insult, strength is ever
  In danger of enfeeblement by foes,
  A handsome <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> is jeoparded by women,
  Scripture is open to assaults of critics,
  Merit incurs the spite of wicked men,
  The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> lives in constant dread of death—
  One course alone is proof against alarm,
  Renounce the world, and safety may be won.

  One hundred years[47] is the appointed span
  Of <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> life, one half of this goes by
  In sleep and night; one half the other half
  In childhood and old age; the rest is passed
  In sickness, separation, pain, and service—
  How can a <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> being <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> delight
  In such a life, vain as a watery bubble?

No doubt this <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of pessimism has always found advocates in all ages,
and among all nations in Europe as <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as in Asia. It was a favourite
<span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> with the Stoics, and it has found favour with Schopenhauer, Von
Hartmann, and other modern philosophers; and Shakespeare makes Hamlet
give expression to it.

Happily the general tone of European philosophical <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> is in another
key, and the admirers of Aristotle still constitute a majority in
Europe. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Stagirite described <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> as ‘Energy,’ and in dealing
with Solon’s dictum that ‘no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> can be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> happy while he lives,’
gave expression to a different belief. A <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> man’s virtuous energies,
he asserted, are in this present <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> a genuine source of happiness to
him; misfortunes cannot shake his well-balanced character; he surmounts
the worst sufferings by generous magnanimity[48].

Even in the East a greater than Aristotle and no less an Authority than
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> ‘Light of the world’—bade <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> rejoice and leap for joy under
the most trying circumstances of life, and prize His gift of <span class="t0 t28 hoverable">Eternal</span>

In India, on the contrary, the Upanishads and systems of philosophy
which followed on them, all harped on the same string. They all dwelt on
the same minor key-note. Their real <span class="t24 t25 hoverable">object</span> was not to investigate truth,
but to devise a scheme for removing the misery believed to result from
repeated bodily existence and from all action, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> or bad, in the
present, previous, and future births.

The Sa?khya (I. 1) defines the chief aim of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> to be deliverance from
the pain incident to bodily <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> and energy; or according to the Nyaya
(I. 2), from the pain resulting from birth, actions, and false
knowledge; while the Vedanta considers that ignorance alone fetters the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> to a body, and the Yoga defines the <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> Purusha (= the
perfect <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> of Buddhism) as a being unaffected by pain (kle?a), acts,
consequences of acts, and impressions derived from acts done in previous
births (a?aya = sa??kara).

Gautama’s sympathy with these ideas is shown by the twelve-linked chain
of causation, put forth by him as an accompaniment to his four
fundamental truths (p. 43), and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> expressed (Maha-vagga I. 1. 2):—

From Ignorance comes the combination of formations or tendencies
(instincts derived from former births[49]); from such formations comes
<span class="t0 t1 t13 t16 t24 t25 hoverable">consciousness</span> (vijñana); from consciousness, <span class="t22 t25 hoverable">individual</span> being
(nama-rupa, name and form); from <span class="t22 t25 hoverable">individual</span> being, the six organs of
<span class="t0 t1 t7 t12 t13 t14 t17 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">sense</span> (including mind); from the six organs, contact (with objects of
sense); from contact, sensation (vedana); from sensation, <span class="t0 t10 t11 t17 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">desire</span> (lust,
thirst, ta?ha = t?ish?a); from desire, clinging to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> (upadana); from
clinging to life, continuity of becoming (bhava); from continuity of
becoming, birth; from birth, decay and death; from decay and death,
suffering.

It is difficult to discover a strictly logical sequence in this curious
twelve-linked chain. The first link is a cause, the ten following are
both causes and effects, while the last is an effect only. The <span class="t0 t2 t5 t13 t14 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">second</span>
(sa?khara) is presented to us afterwards as one of the Skandhas (p.
109), and we have the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> inverted in a <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of circular chain in the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of question and answer, thus:—

What is the cause of misery and suffering? _Answer_—Old age and death.
What is the cause of old age and death? _Answer_—Birth. Of birth?
_Answer_—Continuity of becoming. Of continuity of becoming?
_Answer_—Clinging to life. Of clinging to life? _Answer_—Desire. Of
desire? _Answer_—Sensation or perception. Of sensation? _Answer_—Contact
with the objects of sense. Of contact with objects? _Answer_—The organs
of sense. Of the organs? _Answer_—Name and form, or <span class="t22 t25 hoverable">individual</span> being. Of
<span class="t22 t25 hoverable">individual</span> being? _Answer_—Consciousness (viñña?a = vijñana). Of
consciousness? _Answer_—Combination of formations or tendencies (or
those material and mental predispositions derived from previous births
which tend to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> character, compare p. 109). Of such formations?
_Answer_—Ignorance.

In making Ignorance (Avidya) the first cause of the misery of life,
Gautama agreed with the Vedanta (though he explained Ignorance
differently, see p. 99), while in the remaining chain of causes (Nidana)
we detect his sympathy with the Sa?khya theory of a chain of producers
and products.

His own scheme of causation (often <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Pa?icca-samuppado) occupies an
important <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> in Buddhistic philosophy, as supplementary to, and
complementary of, the four truths (p. 43). It was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> out before
them (see p. 39) and is equally revered.

It is on this <span class="t1 t11 t12 t13 t16 t18 t21 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> that the following celebrated formula is
constantly repeated like a short creed, and is found carved on numerous
Buddhist monuments:—

‘Conditions (or laws) of existence which proceed from a cause, the cause
of these <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hath</span> the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> explained, as also the cessation (or
destruction) of these. Of such truths is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Great</span> ?rama?a the
teacher[50].’

This was the formula repeated by Assaji to Sariputta and Moggallana (p.
47), when they wished to join the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> and asked for a summary of the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> (artha), not the letter (vyañjana), of his doctrine (Maha-v° I.
23. 5). Certainly the sorites-like <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of statement in the scheme of
causation had charms for Oriental thinkers.

Moreover the Buddha’s method of clothing old truths in a new dress,
or—to adopt another metaphor—his plan of putting new wine into old
bottles, had in it something very attractive to all Indian minds.

Of what kind, then, was the new dress in which Gautama clothed the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>
central doctrine of Indian philosophy—the doctrine of metempsychosis,
involving the perpetuation of the misery of life?

The Buddha, like all Indians, was by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> a metaphysician. He had
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> sympathy with the philosophy of the Upanishads. How was it that he
disbelieved in the existence of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Spirit</span> as distinct from bodily organism?
A little consideration will perhaps make clear how he was <span class="t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> to his
own peculiar agnostic view.

Probably before his so-called enlightenment and attainment of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span>
knowledge, he was as firm a believer in the real existence of one
Universal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Spirit</span> as the most orthodox Brahman. He had become imbued with
Brahmanical philosophy while sitting at the feet of his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> teachers
A?ara and Uddaka (p. 29). At that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> there were no definite or
formulated philosophical systems, separated from each other by sharp
lines. But the Sa?khya, Yoga, and Vedanta systems were assuming shape,
and the doctrines they embodied had been foreshadowed in the Upanishads,
and were orally current.

In short, it had been repeatedly stated in the Upanishads, that nothing
really existed but the one universally present impersonal Spirit, and
that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> visible <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> was really to be identified with that
Spirit.

Then it followed as an article of <span class="t7 t13 t19 t20 t29 hoverable">faith</span> that man’s spirit, deluded into
a temporary false <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> of separate independent personal existence by the
illusion of ignorance, was also identical with that One Spirit, and
ultimately to be re-absorbed into it.

Further, it followed that man’s spirit, while so deluded and so
separated for a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> from the One Spirit, was compelled to migrate
through innumerable bodily forms, and that such migration entailed
misery, from which there was no escape except by a process of
disillusionment, that is, by dissipating the illusion of separate
individuality, through the acquisition of perfect <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> leading to
re-union with the One Spirit, as the river blends with the ocean. And
such <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> was best gained by suppression of the passions,
abandonment of all worldly connexions, and abstinence from all action.
Finally, it was held, with apparent inconsistency, that the storing up
of merit by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t7 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">works</span> assisted in effecting this <span class="t24 t25 hoverable">object</span> by raising a
man, not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> fit for union with the supreme Spirit, to forms of
existence in which such union might be accomplished.

Now it is obvious that to believe in the ultimate merging of man’s
personal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> in One impersonal Spirit, is virtually to deny the
ultimate existence of any <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> at all. Nay more—it is virtually
to deny the existence of a supreme universal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Spirit</span> also.

For how can a merely abstract universal Spirit, which is unconscious of
personality, be regarded as possessing any real existence worth being
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> life?

To assert that such a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Spirit</span> is pure abstract Entity or (according to
Vedanta phraseology) pure Existence (without anything to exist for),
pure <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">Thought</span> or even pure <span class="t0 t1 t13 t16 t24 t25 hoverable">Consciousness</span> (without anything to think
about, or be conscious about), pure Joy (without anything to rejoice
about), is practically to reduce it to pure non-entity.

All that Gautama did, therefore, was to purge Brahmanism of a dogma
which appeared to him to be a mere sham (Brahma-jala I. 26).

He simply eliminated as incapable of proof the doctrine of a purely
abstract, incorporeal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> or self, <span class="t0 t5 t8 t10 t14 t15 t21 t24 t28 hoverable">whether</span> <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> or divine. The
assertion that any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> or self or Ego really existed (Atta-vado) was an
error. It formed one of the constituents of Upadana (p. 109), and was
the first of the ten fetters (Sakkaya-di??hi, p. 127).

And with the rejection of this dogma, as incapable of demonstration, he
found himself compelled to reject also, as beyond the range of man’s
cognizance, the doctrine of any Supreme Being <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> than the perfectly
enlightened man. Like Kapila in the Sa?khya aphorisms (I. 92, V. 10) he
felt bound to admit: ‘It is not proved that there is a God.’

This, indeed, is the chief foundation on which rests the assertion that
Buddhism is a mere system of atheistic negations. And there can be no
doubt that from one point of <span class="t25 hoverable">view</span> its statements are steeped in
negations, or rather perhaps in evasions. Its morality has been
described as more negative than positive; but this is scarcely correct,
and it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be fairer to say that it delights in telling <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> to abstain
from doing evil, rather than in urging them to active exertions for the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> of others. It has many positive precepts.

But if there was no probability of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> existing separately from a
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> after death, how could there be any soul-transmigration? How could
there be any agreement between the teaching of the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> and that of
the Brahmans, in regard to this important central dogma? The real <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span>
was that the divergence of the Buddhist doctrine from the Brahmanical,
as stated in the Upanishads, was not greater than was to be expected
from the difference of belief between the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> systems in regard to the
existence of soul.

Plato, we know, held that souls ‘found their prisons in the same
natures’ at death, so that an effeminate <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> might be re-born as a
woman, a tyrannical <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> as a wolf, and so on. In Manu’s Law-book is <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span>
forth a triple <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">order</span> of soul-transmigration through lower, middle, and
<span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> planes of existence, resulting from good, middling, and bad acts,
words, and thoughts. Thus—to instance only the lower—the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span>
who spoke ill of his teacher was destined to <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t11 t12 t19 t22 hoverable">pass</span> into an ass or a dog
(II. 201), the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> of a thief might occupy a mouse (XII. 62), the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span>
of one who neglected his caste-duties might <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t11 t12 t19 t22 hoverable">pass</span> into a demon (XII. 71,
72); and greater crimes might lead to the soul’s being condemned to
occupy plants, stones, and minerals. Then there was also an intermediate
condition of the soul. According to one <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> it <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> to the moon;
according to another it became a hungry ghost which required <span class="t0 t14 t23 t24 hoverable">food</span> to be
offered to it at the ?raddha ceremonies.

This theory of transmigration, according to the Hindus, explained the
origin of evil. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Evil</span> must proceed from antecedent evil, and the
resulting penalty must be borne by the evil-doer in succeeding
existences. This was the terrible incubus which it was the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> <span class="t24 t25 hoverable">object</span>
of Indian philosophers to remove. It was equally Gautama’s object, but
how could he accept soul-transmigration, denying as he did the existence

forth a <span class="t25 hoverable">view</span> of his own, thus:—Every being is composed of five

source in Upadana (p. 103) and are continually combining, dissolving,

3. Perception (_sañña_ = _sañjña_) of ideas through the same sixfold
contact. 4. Aggregate of formations (_sa?khara_ = _sa?skara_, i.e.
combination of properties or faculties or mental tendencies, fifty-two

<span class="t0 t1 t13 t16 t24 t25 hoverable">Consciousness</span> (_viñña?a_ = _vijñana_) or thought[51]. This fifth is the
most important. It is the only <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> recognized by Buddhists.
Theoretically it perishes with the other Skandhas, but practically is
continued, since its exact counterpart is reproduced in a new body.

For although, when a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> dies, all the five constituents of existence

combined with _Upadana_, ‘clinging to existence’ (one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of the

the dominant faculty, starts into being. The process of the new <span class="t0 t1 t5 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">creation</span>
is so instantaneous that it is equivalent to the continuance of the same
personality, pervaded by the same consciousness; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> each personality
is only really connected with the previous by the force of acts done and
character formed in each—such force operating through Upadana. In short,
to <span class="t6 t9 t11 t19 t20 t22 hoverable">speak</span> of transmigration of souls in Buddhism gives a wrong idea.
Metempsychosis with Buddhists resolves itself into continuous
metamorphosis or Palingenesis. For no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> Buddhist believes in the

of what may be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> act-force, or of the merit and demerit resulting
from a man’s acts, so as to cause a continuous succession of
transformations—a succession which may be compared to the rolling on of
a wheel through different scenes and over every variety of ground; or to
the burning on, through <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> and night, of a flame which is not the same
flame at the beginning of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> and end of the night, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> is not
different. It is this act-force (Karma), combined with Upadana,
‘clinging to existence’ (=abhi-nive?a in the Yoga II. 9), which is the
connecting link between each man’s past, present, and future bodies.

In its subtle and irresistible operation it may be compared to stored-up
chemical or electric energy. It is a force which continually creates and
re-creates the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> man, and perpetuates his personal identity through
separate forms, <span class="t0 t5 t8 t10 t14 t15 t21 t24 t28 hoverable">whether</span> it compels him to ascend or descend in the scale
of being.

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> to say that personality is transmitted, when there is no
<span class="t0 t1 t13 t16 t24 t25 hoverable">consciousness</span> of any continuity of identity, amounts, after all, to
denial of continuous existence.

Be it observed, too, that the scale of existence is limited in Buddhism
to six classes of beings—gods, men, demons, animals, ghosts, and
dwellers in hell (p. 121). Transmigration is not extended, as in the
Brahmanical system, to plants, stocks, and stones; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> could be
<span class="t9 t24 hoverable">born</span> as a tree-god (p. 112).

Gautama <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> himself was merely the last link in a <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> chain of
corporeal forms, and he had been preceded by twenty-four Buddhas, who
were to previous ages of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> what he was to the present. Every one
of these Buddhas was gifted with the faculty of recollecting his
previous personalities, and Gautama often gave an <span class="t1 t11 t12 t13 t16 t18 t21 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of his own
former existences. The stories of about five hundred and fifty of his
births (Jatakas) are even now daily repeated to eager listeners in every
Buddhist country, and are believed to convey important lessons, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span>
<span class="t10 t16 hoverable">full</span> of puerilities.

The interchange of ideas between Brahmanism and Buddhism is <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span>
exemplified not only by the twenty-five Buddhas, who correspond to the
fourteen Manus, or representative men, in each world-period (Antara),
but also by the birth-stories, many of which are mere modifications of
old fables <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> current in India, while others have been imported from
Buddhism into Sansk?it literature. They constantly remind one of similar
stories in the Pañca-tantra, Hitopade?a, Ramaya?a, and Maha-bharata. The
noteworthy point about the repeated births of Gautama <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> is, that
there appears to have been no Darwinian rise from lower to <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> forms;
but a mere jumble of metamorphoses. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> we <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> him <span class="t9 t24 hoverable">born</span> four times as
Maha-brahma, twenty times as Indra, once as a hare, eighty-three times
as an ascetic, fifty-eight as a king, twenty-four as a Brahman, once as
a gamester, eighteen times as a monkey, six as an elephant, eleven as a
deer, once as a dog, four times as a serpent, six as a snipe, once as a
frog, twice as a fish, forty-three times as a tree-god, twice as a pig,
ten times as a lion, four as a cock, twice as a thief, once as a
devil-dancer, and so on. He was never <span class="t9 t24 hoverable">born</span> as a woman, nor as an insect,
nor as a Preta, nor an inhabitant of hell (p. 119), and in all his
births he was a Bodhi-sattva (pp. 98, 135). And in all he suffered and
sacrificed himself for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> of the world.

Here is the substance of an <span class="t1 t11 t12 t13 t16 t18 t21 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of Gautama’s birth as a hare, given
by himself (Cariya-Pi?aka I. 10, translated by Dr. Oldenberg):—

‘In one of my lives I was a hare living in a forest. I ate grass and did
no one any harm. An ape, a jackal, and an otter dwelt with me. I <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">used</span> to
teach them their duties and tell them to abstain from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> and give alms
on the four fast-days in every month. They did as I told them, and gave
beans, corn, and rice. Then I said to myself:—Suppose a worthy <span class="t24 t25 hoverable">object</span> of
charity passes by, what can I give him? I live on grass only; I cannot
offer a starving <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> grass; I must give him myself. Thereupon the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">god</span>
?akra, wishing to test my sincerity, came in a Brahman’s <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> and asked
me for food. When I saw him I said joyfully:—“A noble gift will I give
thee, O Brahman; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thou</span> observest the precepts; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thou</span> painest no creature;
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thou</span> wilt not kill me for food. But go, collect wood, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> it in a
heap, and kindle a fire. Then I will roast myself, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thou</span> may’st <span class="t6 hoverable">eat</span>
me.”

‘He said:—“So be it,” and <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> and gathered wood and kindled a fire.

‘When the wood began to send forth flame, I leaped into the midst of the
blazing fire.

‘As <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> quenches heat, so the flames quelled all the sufferings of
life. Cuticle and skin, <span class="t6 t20 hoverable">flesh</span> and sinews, bones, ligaments, and heart—my
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> with all its limbs—I gave to the Brahman.’

Perhaps the best and most often recited Jataka is the last birth but
one, in which he was <span class="t9 t24 hoverable">born</span> as prince Vessantara (Vai?yantara). This is
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the Maha-jataka, ‘great birth.’ It may be summarized thus:—

‘Vessantara (afterwards Buddha) was so liberal that he gave to every one
who asked. Among his possessions was a white elephant, which had the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of bringing down rain whenever it was needed. At last he gave away
this also to a neighbouring country suffering from drought. This so
incensed his own <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> that they persuaded the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">father</span> to
banish him with his wife and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">children</span> to the forest. They <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> out in
a chariot drawn by horses. First he gave away the horses and next the
chariot to Brahmans who begged for them. Then when another <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> asked
for the children, Vessantara gave them up too, saying: “May I for this
act become a Buddha!” In short his sufferings and theirs in banishment,
and his generosity to every one, led to his recall with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>
rejoicings. When he died he was <span class="t9 t24 hoverable">born</span> again in the Tushita heaven, whence
he descended as a white elephant into the womb of Maya, and was <span class="t9 t24 hoverable">born</span> as
Gautama’ (p. 23).

Another <span class="t5 t8 hoverable">wise</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> of the East, who lived <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> before Gautama, spoke of
‘the path of the just shining more and more <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">unto</span> the perfect day.’ Of
this <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of progressive advance towards <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> planes of perfection,
the Indian sage knew nothing. Nor to the Buddha, of course, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> the

holiness and sin, were the product of a man’s own acts. They were
produced by no one but himself, and they were merely troublesome forces
(see p. 124) causing, in the one case, a man’s re-birth either in one of
the heavens or in <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> earthly corporeal forms, and, in the other, his
re-birth in one of the hells or in lower corporeal forms. ‘Not in the

Here also is the substance of a <span class="t28 hoverable">passage</span> in the Deva-duta-sutta
(translated by Dr. Oldenberg):—

‘Do not relatives and friends welcome a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> who has been <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span>

‘Then <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> Yama pronounces his doom:—“These <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thy</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> deeds are not the

of hell drag him to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> of torment, rivet him to red-hot iron,
plunge him in glowing seas of blood, torture him on heaps of burning
coal; and he dies not, till the last residue of his guilt has been
expiated.’

And this Buddhist theory of every man’s destiny being dependent on his
own acts is quite in keeping with Brahmanical ideas. ‘In that (new body)
he is united with the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> gained in the former body, and then
again goes on working for perfection; for even against his will he is
forced on (from one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> to another) by his former works’ (Bhagavad-gita
VI. 43, 44). And again:—‘The act committed in a former birth
(purva-janma-k?ita? karma), that is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> one’s destiny;’ and again,
‘As from a lump of clay a workman makes what he pleases, even so a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span>

Introduction). In Brahmanism the influence of Karma or ‘act’ in
determining every being’s <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> at the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of his own re-birth is
universal.

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> also the Nyaya of Gautama (III. 132) affirms that the new <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span>
(after death) is produced through the irresistible force of actions done
in the previous <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> (purva-k?ita-phalanubandhat tad-utpatti?). The
cosmogony of the same philosophy (Vai?eshika branch), taught that the
concurrence of <span class="t0 t28 hoverable">eternal</span> atoms to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> was the result of
Ad?ish?a or the ‘unseen force’ derived from the acts of a previous
world.

We are reminded, too, of our poet’s own sentiment: ‘Our deeds still
travel with us from afar, And what we have been makes us what we are;’
and of Don Quixote’s saying, ‘Every <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> of his own works;’
and of Wordsworth’s, ‘The child is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">father</span> of the man;’ and of
Longfellow’s, ‘Lives of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> all remind us, we can make ourselves
sublime.’

In short, we are the outcome of ourselves. Nor can ceremonies avail
aught, nor can devotion to personal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> avail aught, nor can anything
whatever possess the slightest efficacy to save a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> from his own acts.

It is said that Buddhism leaves the will unfettered; but surely fatalism
is taught when the force of one’s own deeds in previous births is held
to be irresistible.

The only creator, then, recognized by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> Buddhists is Act-force. ‘My
action is the womb that bears me,’ says the A?guttara Nikaya. It is this
Act-force that creates worlds. It is this Act-force, in conjunction with
Upadana (p. 109), that creates all <span class="t0 t1 t15 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> in any of the six classes into
which they are divided—gods, men, demons, animals, ghosts, and the
dwellers in hell. We often talk of the force of a dead man’s acts—of his
being dead and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> speaking. It is this force which in Buddhism resists
death; for no force can ever be lost.

And what does the modern Positivist philosopher assert? He maintains
that both <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> are resolved into their elements at death. The
only immortal part of us consists in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> deeds, words, thoughts,
and influences we leave behind us, to be made <span class="t1 hoverable">use</span> of by our descendants
and improved on for the elevation of humanity. And the aggregate of
these, combined with the force of will, constitute, according to the
Buddhist, a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> strong enough to re-create not only <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t0 t1 t15 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> but
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> material world.

It was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> that the force of Gautama’s own acts had constantly
re-created him through a <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> chain of successive personalities,
terminating in the perfect Buddha, who has no further births to undergo.

Turn we now to that division of the Buddhist system which concerns
itself with the external universe, and seeks to explain its
constitution, form, and the various divisions of which it consists.

And here we must be careful to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">note</span> the peculiar views of Buddhism,
notwithstanding the large admixture of Brahmanical ideas.

For Buddhism has no cosmogony like the Sa?khya, Vedanta, and Vai?eshika.
Nor does it explain the <span class="t0 t1 t5 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">creation</span> of the universe, in our sense. It only
concerns itself with cosmology, and it dissents from Brahmanical
cosmology in declining to admit the eternity of anything whatever,
except change or revolution or a succession of revolutions. Buddhism has
no Creator, no creation, no original germ of all things, no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> of the
world, no personal, no impersonal, no supramundane, no antemundane
principle.

It might indeed have been supposed that since Gautama denied the <span class="t0 t28 hoverable">eternal</span>
existence of either a personal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> or of Spirit, he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> at least have
given <span class="t0 t28 hoverable">eternal</span> existence to matter.

But no; the only <span class="t0 t28 hoverable">eternal</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> are the Causality of Act-force and the
succession of cause and effect—the eternity of ‘Becoming,’ not of
‘Being.’

The Universe around us, with all its visible phenomena, must be
recognized as an existing entity, for we see before our <span class="t2 t6 t19 t20 t26 t29 hoverable">eyes</span> evidence of
its actual existence. But it is an entity produced out of nonentity, and
destined to lapse again into nonentity when its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> is fulfilled.

For out of nothingness it came, and into nothingness must it return—to
re-appear again, it is true, but as a new Universe <span class="t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> into being by
the accumulated force of its predecessor’s acts, and not evolved out of
any eternally existing <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> or material germ of any kind.

It is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> that Universe after Universe is like a succession of
countless bubbles for ever forming, expanding, drifting onwards,
bursting and re-forming, each bubble owing its re-formation to the force
generated by its vanished predecessor. The poet Shelley might have been
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> a Buddhist when he wrote:

  Worlds on worlds are rolling ever
    From <span class="t0 t1 t5 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">creation</span> to decay;
  Like the bubbles on a river,
    Sparkling, bursting, borne away. (Hellas.)

Or like lotuses, for ever unfolding and then decaying, each decay
containing the germ of a new plant; or like an interminable succession
of wheels for ever coming into view, for ever rolling onwards,
disappearing and reappearing; for ever passing from being to non-being,
and again from non-being to being. It was this ceaseless rotation that
led to the wheel being adopted as the favourite symbol in Buddhism (p.
122).

Christianity recognizes in a very different <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> this ‘law of
circularity’ in the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> world, as the Rev. Hugh Macmillan has ably
pointed out.

As to the question from whom? or whence? or how? came the original force
or impetus that started the first movement, the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> hazarded no
opinion. He held this to be an inexplicable mystery—an insoluble riddle.
He confessed himself to be a thorough Agnostic. He saw nothing but
countless cycles of causes and effects, and never undertook to explain
the first cause which <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> the first wheel in motion. It was not, then,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> a deep significance that Gautama placed Ignorance first in his
chain of Causation (p. 102. Note, however, the explanation given at p.
99).

After all, these Buddhistic speculations amount to little else than
Brahmanism stripped of some of its transcendental mysticism. We know,
for example, that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> Vedanta philosophy makes the Universe proceed
out of an <span class="t0 t28 hoverable">eternal</span> Illusion, or Ignorance associated with the impersonal
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Spirit</span> Brahman, into which it is again absorbed.

Can it be affirmed, then, a Buddhist might say, that either this pure
impersonal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Spirit</span> (or Ignorance) is virtually very different from pure
nothingness?

What says the author of ?ig-veda X. 120?—

  In the beginning there was neither naught nor aught,
  Then there was neither sky nor atmosphere above.
  Then first came darkness hid in darkness, gloom in gloom;
  Next all was water, all a chaos indiscreet,
  In which the One lay void, shrouded in nothingness.

Then as to the vast periods <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Kalpas or ages, during which (as in
Brahmanism) constant Universes are supposed to appear, disappear, and
re-appear:—

Let it be supposed, say Buddhist writers, that a solid rock forming a
vast cube sixteen miles high, and the same in length and breadth, were
lightly rubbed once in a hundred <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> with a piece of the finest cloth,
and by this slight friction reduced in countless ages to the size of a
mango-seed; that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> still give you no <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> of the immense duration of
a Buddhist Kalpa.

And what, in conclusion, is the existing Universe? Buddhist writers make
it consist of an infinite <span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span> of Cakkavalas (Cakra-valas) or vast
circular planes, which for convenience may be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> spheres. Each
sphere has thirty-one Satta-lokas (Sattva-lokas) or dwelling-places of
six classes of living beings, rising one above the other and distributed
under <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> world-systems, built up in successive tiers through infinite
space, below, upon, and above Mount Meru (or Sumeru)—the ideal central
point of the whole. This gigantic mythical mountain forms the mighty
base or pivot of the sphere.

First comes Hell with 136 divisions, to receive 136 varieties of
offenders, all in tiers one above the other, and lying deep under the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> in the lower regions of the Cakra-vala. To be re-born in Hell
(Naraka) is the worst of all the six kinds of existence, reserved for
the worst evil-doers, and although the punishment is not eternal, its
shortest duration is for five hundred <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> of Hell, each <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> equalling
fifty <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> of Earth. In Brahmanism there are twenty-one hells (Manu IV.
88-90). Buddhism originally had only eight. The most terrific (Avici) is
for revilers of <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> and his Law.

Above the subdivisions of Hell come the other sensuous worlds
(Kama-lokas), thus:—(2) the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> of animals; (3) that of Pretas or
ghosts; (4) that of Asuras or demons; (5) the earth, or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> of men,
with concentric circles of seven seas.

Having distributed all possible places of habitation for migrating

heavens (described at p. 206), Buddhism holds that there are only six
forms or ways (gati) of existence through which living <span class="t0 t1 t15 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> can pass,
and under which every <span class="t3 t5 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">thing</span> that has <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> must be classed, and of these
the first <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> ways are good, the last four bad, thus:—1. Gods; 2. Men;
3. Asuras, or demons, inhabiting spaces under the earth; 4. Animals; 5.
Pretas, or ghosts, recently inhabitants of earth, and ever consumed with
hunger and thirst; 6. <span class="t0 t1 t15 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">Beings</span> undergoing torment in the hells.

As to the gods, bear in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> that Buddhism recognized most of the
deities of Hinduism. See p. 206.

Such <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> existed in subtle corporeal forms, and, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> not omnipotent,
were capable of working benefit or harm. They were subject to the
universal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">law</span> of dissolution, and after <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> were succeeded by others,
so that there was not one Brahma or one ?akra, but many successive
deities so named, and many classes of deities under them. They had no
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of effecting any person’s salvation. On the contrary, they had to
see to their own, and were inferior to the perfected man.

Moreover, to be <span class="t9 t24 hoverable">born</span> in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> seems not to have implied
any vast accumulation of merit, for we read of a certain frog that from
simply listening to the Buddha’s voice, while reciting the Law, was <span class="t9 t24 hoverable">born</span>
as a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">god</span> in the Trayastri??a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heaven</span> (Hardy, p. 392).

In short, the constant revolving of the wheel of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> in one <span class="t0 t28 hoverable">eternal</span>
circle, according to fixed and immutable laws, is perhaps after all the
sum and substance of the philosophy of Buddhism. And this <span class="t0 t28 hoverable">eternal</span> wheel
or circle has, so to speak, six spokes representing six forms of
existence.

When any one of the six classes of <span class="t0 t1 t15 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> dies, he must be <span class="t9 t24 hoverable">born</span> again in
some one of these same six classes, for there are no other possible ways
(gati) of life, and he cannot <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t11 t12 t19 t22 hoverable">pass</span> into plants, stones, and inorganic
matter, as in the Brahmanical system (see p. 108). If he be <span class="t9 t24 hoverable">born</span> again
in one of the hells he is not thereby debarred from seeking salvation,
and even if he be <span class="t9 t24 hoverable">born</span> in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heaven</span> as a god, he must at some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> or other

has gained Nirva?a and is soon to achieve the one consummation worth
living for, the one crown worth striving for—extinction of personal
existence in Pari-nirva?a (see pp. 138-142).




                              LECTURE VI.
   _The Morality of Buddhism and its chief aim—Arhatship or Nirva?a._


The first questions suggested by the subject of this lecture will
probably be:—

How could a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of morality be inculcated by one who made all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span>
proceed from ignorance, and even virtuous conduct in one <span class="t0 t1 t7 t12 t13 t14 t17 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">sense</span> a
mistake, as leading to continuity of life, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> of suffering?
How could the Buddha’s first commandment be, ‘Destroy not,’ when his
ideal of perfection was destruction? How could he say, ‘be active,’ when
his theory of Karma (pp. 110, 114) made action conduce to misery?

The inconsistency is evident, but it is no less <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> that,
notwithstanding the doctrine that all existence entails misery, and that
all action, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> or bad, leads to future births, Gautama taught that the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> in <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> bodily forms, or in one of the heavens, was
better than a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> in lower forms, or in one of the hells, and that
neither a <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> nor the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> aim of Nirva?a could be
attained <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> righteous action, meditation, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> knowledge.

Buddhism, indeed, as we have seen, could not hold forth as an incentive
to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> behaviour any belief in a Creator rewarding and punishing his
creatures according to their works, or pardoning their sins. It could
not inculcate piety; for in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> Buddhism piety was impossible; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> like
Manu (II. 6) it made morality (?ila) the basis of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Law</span> (Dharma); it
stimulated <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> conduct by its doctrine of repeated births, and by
pictures of its numerous heavens, and it deterred <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> from unrighteous
acts by its terrible places of torment.

Let it then be made clear from the first that Buddhism, in inculcating
morality, <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">used</span> no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> expressive of morality, as founded on the <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span>
and <span class="t9 t19 hoverable">fear</span> of God, or of <span class="t2 t5 t8 t17 t18 t19 hoverable">sin</span> as an offence against God.

In Buddhism the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> kle?a (kileso), ‘pain,’ and aku?ala, ‘demerit,’
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> of ‘sin,’ and its perfect saint is said to be ‘free from
pain’ (nishkle?a) and from demerit, not from <span class="t2 t5 t8 t17 t18 t19 hoverable">sin</span> in our sense. By an
unrighteous act it meant an act producing suffering and demerit of some
<span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> (p. 113), and it bade every <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> act righteously in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">order</span> to escape
suffering and to accumulate merit (ku?ala), and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> out his own
perfection—that is to say, his own self-extinction.

Doubtless Buddhism deserves credit for laying stress on right belief,
right words, right work, instead of on ceremonial rites; and on the
<span class="t0 t5 t11 hoverable">worship</span> of Hindu gods; but it had its own <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> of right. It urged
householders to abandon the world, or else to be diligent in serving its
monks for the working out of their own salvation; and while making
morality, meditation, and enlightenment its indispensable factors in
securing perfection, it made perfection consist in freedom from the
delusion that ‘I am;’ and in deliverance from an <span class="t22 t25 hoverable">individual</span> existence
inseparably bound up with misery.

Mark, too, another contradiction. It inculcated entire self-dependence
in working out this <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of perfection, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> it <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> before its
disciples <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> guides; namely, the Buddha’s own example, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Law</span>
(Dharma), and the example of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> of monks and perfected
saints (Sa?gha).

We now turn to its fuller moral system, keeping this distinct from its
philosophy and metaphysics, and freely admitting that there are in
Buddhist morality many things, true, honourable, just, pure, lovely, and
of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> report.

It is fair to point out at the outset that Buddhist morality was not a
purely external matter. It divided <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> into the outwardly correct and
internally sincere. The mere outwardly correct Buddhists might include
monks as <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as laymen, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> a <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> standard of profession was
expected of monks. The internally sincere were the really earnest
seekers after perfection (monks and laymen), and were divided into four
classes, representing four conditions of the inner life, lower, higher,
still higher, and highest, culminating in perfect Saintship, Arhatship,
and Nirva?a (p. 132).

At the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> there was not much hope of saintship except through
celibacy and monkhood; for in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> Buddhism the notion of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">holy</span>
family-life was almost a contradiction in terms.

Of course the Buddhist moral code soon passed beyond the eightfold path
propounded by Gautama in his first sermon (see p. 44), and Dr. Oldenberg
has shown that in the absence of a systematically arranged code, we may
still trace out amid a confusion of precepts the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> leading duties of
external moral conduct (?ila), of internal mental concentration
(samadhi), and of acquiring <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t7 t8 t12 hoverable">wisdom</span> (pañña = prajña). Compare Dr.
Wenzel’s ‘Friendly Epistle,’ 53.

The five fundamental rules of moral conduct (?ila), or rather,
prohibitions, were promulgated very early:—

1. Kill not any living thing. 2. Steal not. 3. Commit not adultery. 4.
Lie not. 5. Drink not strong drink. These five, having reference chiefly
to one’s neighbour, were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the fivefold <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">law</span> _for all classes_,
including laymen. They were <span class="t2 t5 t11 t18 t19 t23 t26 hoverable">taken</span> from Brahmanism, but in the vows of
the Sannyasi the fifth was not included. It was Buddhism probably that
first interdicted strong drink. It prohibited too what the Brahmans
allowed—killing for sacrificial purposes.

Five others of a more trivial character for monks (often given in a
different order, p. 78) were added:—

6. <span class="t6 hoverable">Eat</span> no food, except at stated times. 7. <span class="t1 hoverable">Use</span> no wreaths, ornaments, or
perfumes. 8. <span class="t1 hoverable">Use</span> no <span class="t17 t29 hoverable">high</span> or broad bed, but only a mat on the ground. 9.
Abstain from dancing, singing, music, and worldly spectacles. 10. Own no
gold, or silver of any kind, and accept none (Maha-vagga I. 56). [This
Buddhist Decalogue may be contrasted with the Mosaic Decalogue.]

All ten were binding on monks only, and for the <span class="t26 hoverable">third</span> was then
substituted ‘be absolutely chaste.’

Sometimes not only the first five but the first eight were held to be
binding on laymen.

Another was added in later times:—Never think or say that your own
religion is the best. Never denounce the religion of others (see p. 90).

Then, although only the first half of the eightfold path (p. 44) was
said to be necessary for lay-brethren, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> was for monks, who also
had to observe the special practices already described (p. 76).

All gambling and games of chance were prohibited (Tevijja-Sutta II).
Compare Manu IX. 221-228.

Sometimes five renunciations are named:—of wife, of children, of money,
of life, of craving for existence in future births.

Then sometimes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> (sometimes four) corrupting influences (asava =
asrava) are enumerated—of lust (kama), of life, of ignorance, (of
delusion.)

Most important to be got rid of are the ten fetters (sa?yojana, p. 45)
binding a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> to existence:—

1. Belief in the existence of a personal self or Ego (sakkaya-di??hi);
2. Doubt (vicikitsa); 3. Ceremonial practices (silabbata = ?ila-vrata);
4. Lust or sensuality (kama); 5. Anger (pa?igha); 6. Craving for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> in
a material <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> (rupa-raga) either on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> or in heaven; 7. Longing for
immaterial <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> (arupa-raga) in the <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> heavens; 8. Pride (mana); 9.
Self-exaltation (auddhatya); 10. Ignorance. Of these, 1, 3, and 4, with
di??hi, ‘wrong belief,’ are the four constituents of Upadana, ‘clinging
to existence’ (p. 109).

The seven jewels of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">law</span> (p. 49) are—1. the five contemplations or
reflections; 2. the four right exertions (p. 50); 3. the four paths to
supernatural <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> (p. 50); 4. the five moral forces (p. 50); 5. the
right <span class="t1 hoverable">use</span> of the five organs of sense; 6. the seven limbs of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span>
(p. 50); 7. the eightfold path (p. 44).

The five above-named reflections are—1. on the thirty-two impurities of
the body; 2. on the duty of displaying <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> (Maitri) towards all beings;
3. on compassion for all who suffer; 4. on rejoicing with all who
rejoice; 5. on absolute indifference (upeksha) to joy or sorrow. These
contemplations (bhavana) in Buddhism <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> of prayer. The last
is the highest. The first is also a Sati-pa??hana (p. 49). They must not
be confused with the meditations (Dhyanas, p. 209).

Then come six (or ten) transcendent virtues <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Paramitas, ‘leading
to the further shore,’ for Arhats. These, too, every Bodhi-sattva had to
practise before he could attain Buddhahood. They were:—1. Generosity or
giving (Dana) to all who ask, even the sacrificing of limbs or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> for
others; this is most important; 2. Virtue or moral conduct (?ila); 3.
Patience or tolerance (Kshanti); 4. Fortitude or energy (Virya); 5.
Suppression of <span class="t0 t10 t11 t17 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">desire</span> (Nekkhamma = naishkamya), or, according to some,
profound contemplation; 6. Transcendental <span class="t7 t8 t12 hoverable">wisdom</span> (Pañña = Prajña). To
which are added—7. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Truth</span> (Satya); 8. Steadfast resolution (Adhish?hana);
9. Good-will or kindness (Maitra); 10. Absolute indifference or
imperturbability or apathy (Upeksha), resulting in a <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of ecstatic
quietude.

This <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of memorial tabulation in lists of 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, etc., is of
course a product of later Buddhism.

I now give examples from the Dharma-pada:—

‘By oneself is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> done; by oneself is one injured; by oneself is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span>
<span class="t1 t7 t12 t29 hoverable">left</span> undone; by oneself is one purified; no one purifies another.’
(Compare Manu IV. 240.)

‘Better than dominion over the earth, better than going to Heaven, or
having sovereignty over the worlds, is the attainment of the first step
in sanctification.’

‘Not to commit evil, to accumulate merit by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> deeds (kusalassa
upasampada), to purify the heart, this is the doctrine of the
Enlightened’ (165, 178, 183).

‘As a frontier town is guarded[52] <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">within</span> and without, so guard
thyself.’ (Dh. 315.)

‘He who holds back rising anger like a rolling chariot, him I <span class="t8 t13 t21 hoverable">call</span> a
real driver; any other merely holds the reins.’ (Dh. 222. Compare Manu
II. 88.)

‘Let a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> overcome anger by gentleness, let him overcome the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> by
good; the parsimonious by liberality, the liar by truth.’ (Dh. 223. Manu
VI. 47, 48.)

‘The fully enlightened finds no satisfaction even in heavenly pleasures;
but only in suppression of desires.’

‘One by one, little by little, moment by moment, a <span class="t5 t8 hoverable">wise</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> frees
himself from personal impurities as a refiner blows away the dross of
silver.’ (Dh. 187, 239.)

‘There is a treasure laid up in the heart, a treasure of charity,
purity, temperance, soberness. A treasure, secure, impregnable, that no
thief can steal; a treasure that follows after death. (Compare Manu IV.
241.) Universal science, all the perfections, supernatural knowledge,
supreme Buddhaship itself this treasure can procure.’ (Childers’
Nidhi-ka??a.)

The following are some of the <span class="t2 t15 t24 hoverable">blessed</span> states described in the
Mahama?gala-sutta. They prove that Gautama required married <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> to
discharge their duties faithfully.

‘The succouring of mother and father, the cherishing of child and wife,
and the following of a peaceful calling, this is the greatest blessing’
(ma?galam uttamam).

‘The giving alms, a religious life, aid rendered to relations, blameless
acts, this is the greatest blessing.’

‘Reverence and humility, contentment and gratefulness, the hearing of
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Law</span> at the right time, this is the greatest blessing.’

‘Patience and lowly speech, association with religious men, recitation
of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Law</span> at the right time, this is the greatest blessing.’

‘Self-mortification and chastity, discernment of the noble truths,
perception of Nirva?a, this is the greatest blessing.’

In the A?guttara (II. iv. 2) it is said that no adequate return can be
made by <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">children</span> to parents ‘even by menial service.’ With Gautama, to
honour <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">father</span> and mother was better than to <span class="t0 t5 t11 hoverable">worship</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> of heaven.

Many other examples might be given. Not only was a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> forbidden to
kill, he was never to injure.

Then in the Rajovada Jataka we have the story of the one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> ‘who
overcomes the strong by strength, the soft by softness, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> by
goodness, and the wicked by wickedness;’ and of the other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> ‘who
conquers anger by calmness, the wicked by goodness, the stingy by gifts,
the liar (alika-vadinam) by truth.’

Other precepts require a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> to exercise charity and respect towards all
aged persons, teachers, servants, and animals. He was to <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> an example
of self-sacrifice.

It is recorded of Gautama <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> that on one occasion he plucked out his
own eyes, and that on another he cut off his own head, and that on a
<span class="t26 hoverable">third</span> he cut his own <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> to pieces to redeem a dove from a hawk.

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> we repeat that with all this apparently sublime morality no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span>
<span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> of sin, as displeasing to a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">Holy</span> God, was connected with the
infraction of the moral code. Nor did a Buddhist always avoid harming
others from any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> reverence for life. He was to cherish the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of
others, but his chief motive was the <span class="t9 t19 hoverable">fear</span> that by not doing so he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span>
entail the misery of continuous <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> on himself; and his chief motive
for avoiding anger was that it was incompatible with that equanimity,
which ought to characterize every <span class="t5 t8 hoverable">wise</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> who aimed at the extinction
of his own personality.

The ease with which charitable acts might be performed is amusingly
illustrated by a story told in Huc’s travels in Tibet. A certain zealous
fellow-traveller (who considered that it was quite possible to be at the
same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> Buddhist and a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> Christian) invited the French
missionaries to co-operate with him in performing charitable acts to
commemorate the termination of a fatiguing journey, especially by
providing worn-out travellers, like themselves, with horses. The
missionaries pleaded their own poverty, but to their surprise were told
that they were only required to draw horses on paper, which were <span class="t2 t5 t11 t18 t19 t23 t26 hoverable">taken</span>
to the edge of a precipice, thrown up into the air, and, certain
formularies being recited, were carried away by the wind and changed
into real horses by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of Buddha.

Let us by no means, however, shut our <span class="t2 t6 t19 t20 t26 t29 hoverable">eyes</span> to the praiseworthy feature
of the Buddhist system mentioned at page 125—its recognition of the need
of inner purity and sanctification—an inner Buddhism of the heart,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> which even a monk was no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> Buddhist. Of course the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Law</span> could
be observed superficially <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> any real heart-belief or heart-purity.

When the inner heart-condition of a Buddhist is described, he is said to
be walking on one of four paths (cattaro Magga), and is then <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span>
Ariyo (= Arya), ‘worthy of reverence’ (distinguished from P?ithag-jana,
‘an ordinary professing Buddhist’). To avoid confounding these paths
with the eightfold path (p. 44) it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be better to <span class="t6 t9 t11 t19 t20 t22 hoverable">speak</span> of them as
four stages of inner sanctification. Dhyana, ‘meditation,’ of four
kinds, is the chief means of entering and passing through these stages
(p. 32), which once entered can never be abandoned.

The first stage is that of the man—be he monk or layman—who is just
converted, by an inner awakening, to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> heart-Buddhism. This <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> has
freed himself from the first <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> fetters—namely, delusion of self,
doubts about the Buddha’s doctrine, and dependence on external rites (p.
127). He is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Sotapanno, ‘one who has entered the stream’
(Srota-apanna), _inevitably_ carrying him onwards—though not necessarily
in the same body—to the calm ocean of Nirva?a, and his <span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span>
Sotapatti. He can only be re-born as a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">god</span> or man, but not in the four
lower births (p. 121).

Mark that the doctrine of ‘perseverance’ is a remarkable feature in this
phase of the Buddhist system.

The <span class="t0 t2 t5 t13 t14 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">second</span> stage is that of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> who has nearly freed himself from
the first five fetters, but has a sufficient <span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span> <span class="t1 t7 t12 t29 hoverable">left</span> to cause one
more birth on the earth. He is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Sakad-agami (Sak?id-ag°).

The <span class="t26 hoverable">third</span> stage is that of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> who is quite <span class="t1 t8 hoverable">free</span> from the first five
fetters. Such a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> can only be re-born in a Brahma heaven, from which
he reaches Nirva?a. He is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> An-agami, ‘one who will not
come back to earth.’

The fourth stage is that of the completely freed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> who attains
Arhatship (Arahatta?) in this life, and will at <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> experience no
re-birth. There is, of course, a difference between one who has only
just entered each stage of the journey and one who has reached the
terminus. And this Arhatship is open to all (even to women), <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> only
likely to be attained by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> monks or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> nuns. The name Arhat (Pali
Araha, in Ceylon Rahat), ‘most deserving’ (root _arh_), is significant
of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t22 t23 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">highest</span> merit; for the Arhat is perfect, freed from all pain
(nishkle?a), from all the ten fetters, from all attachment to existence
(upadana) <span class="t0 t5 t8 t10 t14 t15 t21 t24 t28 hoverable">whether</span> on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> or in heaven, and from all re-creative
Act-force. He has already entered Nirva?a, and while still living he is
dead to the world. He is the Jivan-mukta, ‘emancipated living man,’ of
the Yoga. By the force of the fourth Dhyana, he has gained the Abhijñas
(Abhiñña), or ‘transcendent faculties of knowledge,’ the inner eye,
inner ear, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of all thoughts, and recollection of previous
existences, and the extraordinary powers over matter <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Iddhi (=
?iddhi). In short he is Asekha, ‘one who has nothing to learn.’

Although, theoretically, a layman and even <span class="t0 t1 t15 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> existing in other
spheres, might enter the stream leading to Arhatship (see p. 90) <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span>
becoming monks, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> it is evident that as a rule it was only likely to
be entered by persons who renounced the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> and led a celibate
monastic life.

But of Arhats there are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> grades:—

First, the simple Arhat (described above), who has attained perfection
through his own efforts and the doctrine and example of a supreme
Buddha, but is not himself such a Buddha, and cannot teach others how to
attain Arhatship, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> he associates with others.

Secondly, and <span class="t0 t2 t5 t13 t14 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">second</span> in rank, but far above the simple Arhat, the
Pratyeka-Buddha or Solitary Saint, who has attained perfection for
himself and by himself alone, and not as a member of any monastic Order,
nor through the teaching of any supreme <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> (except in some former
birth). This solitary hermit-like Arhat—a <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of concentration of
isolated or selfish sanctity—is symbolized by a rhinoceros. He does not
appear on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> at the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> with a supreme Buddha, and has not the
same epithets (p. 23) applied to him.

Thirdly, the supreme <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> or <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> _par excellence_ (once a
Bodhi-sattva), who, having by his own self-enlightening insight attained
perfect <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> (sambodhi), and having, by the practice of the
transcendent virtues (p. 128) and through extinction of the passions and
of all <span class="t0 t10 t11 t17 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">desire</span> for life, become entitled to that complete extinction of
bodily existence (pari-nirva?a), in which the perfection of all
Arhatship must end, has <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> delayed this consummation that he may become
the Saviour of a suffering world—not in the same manner as the God-sent
Saviour of Christianity, but by teaching <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> how to save themselves.
This is the supreme Buddha, the founder of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> monastic Order,
immeasurably superior both to Pratyeka-Buddhas and to all mere Arhats.

He said of himself (Maha-vagga I. 6, 8),—‘I am the all-subduer
(sabbabhibhu); the all-wise; I have no stains; through myself I possess
knowledge; I have no rival (pa?ipuggalo); I am the chief Arhat—the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t22 t23 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">highest</span> teacher; I alone am the absolutely <span class="t5 t8 hoverable">wise</span> (Sambuddha); I am the
Conqueror (Jina); all the fires of <span class="t0 t10 t11 t17 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">desire</span> are quenched (sitibhuto) in
me; I have Nirva?a (nibbuto).’ See p. 42 of this volume.

This seems a marvellous assumption on the part of one who never claimed
to be other than a man; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> he had <span class="t2 t5 t11 t18 t19 t23 t26 hoverable">taken</span> the <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> from Brahmanism, which
held that its saints could surpass all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> (Brahma only excepted).

Such supreme Buddhas, who are perfect knowers, and also perfect teachers
of the truth, are only manifested on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> at <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> intervals of
time.

Gautama is the fourth <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> of the present age (Bhadra-Kalpa). He was a
Kshatriya; his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> mythical predecessors—Kraku-cchanda, Kanaka-muni,
and Ka?yapa—having been <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t25 t26 hoverable">sons</span> of Brahmans. He is to be followed by the
fifth Buddha, Maitreya (a name <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> ‘full of <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> towards all
beings’), but not until the doctrine of Gautama has passed out of men’s
memory after five <span class="t6 hoverable">thousand</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> (p. 181). In their previous existences
Gautama and his predecessors were, (see pp. 98, 112,) Bodhi-sattvas[53],
‘beings who have <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> (derived from intellect) for their essence,’
a name borne by all destined to become supreme Buddhas as <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as by the
first of Gautama’s successors, Maitreya.

This coming <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> is, as we shall see hereafter, an <span class="t24 t25 hoverable">object</span> of universal
reverence among later Buddhists of all sects as a <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of expected
Messiah or Saviour. Often, indeed, he is more honoured than Gautama
himself, because he is interested in the present <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">order</span> of things, as
<span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as in the future, while Gautama <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> and all his predecessors
have passed away into non-being.

Twenty-four mythical Buddhas (the first being Dipa?kara, ‘Light-causer’)
are held to have appeared[54] before Gautama in preceding cycles of
time. Many particulars about them are given, including their
birth-places, the length of their lives and their statures. Gautama
himself is said to have met some of them during his transmigrations.
Even the trees under which they achieved supreme <span class="t7 t8 t12 hoverable">wisdom</span> are enumerated.

Sometimes the last six of the twenty-four are reckoned with Gautama
<span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> as constituting seven principal Buddhas[55], who seem to have
been grouped <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> to correspond with the Brahmanical seven Manus of
the present Kalpa. Usually, however, Gautama is held to be the last of
twenty-five Buddhas.

Clearly, then, the principal lines of Buddhist moral teaching all
converge to one focus—to the perfected Arhat or rather to a still
brighter point of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> in the perfect <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> waiting for his reward—the
nectar of the <span class="t0 t28 hoverable">eternal</span> <span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> of complete Nirva?a.

And this compels us to attempt some explanation of Nirva?a. In the first
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> forty-six synonyms of it are given in the Abhidhanappadipika, e.g.
Mokkha or Mutti, ‘deliverance,’ Nirodha, ‘cessation,’ Ta?hakkhaya
(t?ish?a-kshaya), ‘destruction of lust,’ Arupa, Khema, Kevala, Apavagga,
‘emancipation,’ Nibbuti (= nirv?iti), ‘quietude,’ Amata (Am?ita),
‘deathless nectar.’

The following is from Rhys Davids’ Jataka (p. 4): ‘One <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> the <span class="t5 t8 hoverable">wise</span>
Sumedha fell a-thinking, thus:—“Grievous is re-birth in a new existence,
and the dissolution of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> in each successive <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> where we are
re-born. I am subject to birth, to decay, to disease, to death. It is
right, being such, that I should strive to attain the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> deathless

and joy.

‘“For as in this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> there is pleasure—the opposite of pain—so where
there is existence there must be its opposite, the cessation of
existence; and as where there is heat there is also cold which
neutralizes it, so there must be a Nirva?a that extinguishes (the fires
of) lust and the other passions; and as in opposition to a bad and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span>

an end to all re-birth.

‘“Just as a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> who has fallen into a heap of filth, if he beholds afar

that pond, saying, ‘By what <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> shall I arrive there?’ but if he does
not seek it, the fault is not that of the pond; even so where there is

What, then, is the proper definition of Nirva?a (Pali Nibbana)? In
venturing on an explanation of so controverted a term, I feel rather
like a foolhardy <span class="t0 t4 t5 t10 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">person</span> walking barefoot over thorny ground.
Nevertheless I may fearlessly assert <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> about it.

The first is, that the term Nirva?a was not originated by Gautama. It
was an expression common to both Brahmanism and Buddhism, and most of
its synonyms such as moksha, apavarga, and nirv?iti are still common to
both. It was current in Gautama’s time, and certainly occurs in the
Maha-bharata, parts of which are of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> antiquity.

In the celebrated episode of that poem <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Bhagavad-gita[56], V. 24,
we <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> the following:—

‘That Yogi who is internally happy, internally satisfied and internally
illumined, attains extinction in the Supreme Being, and becomes that
Being’ (Yo ’nta?sukho ‘ntararamas tathantarjyotir eva ya?, | Sa Yogi
Brahma-nirva?a?[57] Brahma-bhuto ’dhigacchati).

The <span class="t0 t2 t5 t13 t14 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">second</span> point is that it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be about as unreasonable to expect
that Nirva?a should always be explained in one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> as to restrict
Brahmanism and Buddhism—two most elastic, comprehensive, and Protean
systems, which have constantly changed their front to suit changing
circumstances and varying national peculiarities at different epochs and
in different countries—to one hard and fast outline.

It is certainly singular that although the term Nibbana (Sansk?it
Nirva?a)—like some of the crucial theological terms of Christianity—has
led to endless discussions, it does not occur often in the Pali texts.
The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> Arahattam, ‘Arhatship,’ is more common.

Nirva?a, of course, originally means ‘the <span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> of a blown-out flame.’
Hence its first <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> is properly restricted to the complete
extinction of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> chief fires[58] of lust, ill-will, and delusion,
and a total cessation of all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> passions and desires[59], especially
of the <span class="t0 t10 t11 t17 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">desire</span> for <span class="t22 t25 hoverable">individual</span> existence (name and form).

Following on this is the <span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> of release from all pain and from all
ignorance, accompanied by a <span class="t0 t1 t7 t12 t13 t14 t17 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">sense</span> of profound rest—a <span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> achieved by
all Arhats while still living in the world[60], and notably by the
<span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> at the moment when he attained Buddhahood, forty-five <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span>
before his final Pari-nirva?a. Nirva?a then is not necessarily the
annihilation of all existence. It is the absence of kle?a (p. 124), as
in the Yoga system, and corresponds very much to the Brahmanical
Apavarga, described in the Nyaya, and defined by a commentator,
Vatsyayana, to be Sarva-du?kha-cheda (‘the cutting off of all pain’). In
short, it is Arhatship.

But besides Nirva?a we have the expression Pari-nirva?a. This is not
merely the blowing out of the fires of the passions but also the entire
cessation of re-births, with extinction of all the elements or seeds of
bodily existence. This <span class="t2 t4 t6 t9 t18 t19 t22 hoverable">took</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> when the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> died or ‘passed away’
after innumerable previous deaths. Practically, however, in Buddhism the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> of every ordinary being amounts to this <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of Nirva?a; for, if
there is no recollection of any former <span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> of existence in the new
being created by Karma, what is every <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> but utter personal
extinction?

Now with regard to the Nirva?a of Arhatship, no one can have come in
contact with the natives of India in their own country, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span>
observing that for a genuine aristocratic <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> to allow others to see
him give <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> to any passion, to exhibit any emotion or enthusiasm, is
regarded as a proof of weakness.

We can easily understand, therefore, that when the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> exhorted his
followers to strive after a wholly impassive condition, he addressed a
sympathetic audience.

<span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">Long</span> before his exhortations were <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t18 hoverable">heard</span> in India, his fellow-countrymen
held persons in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t22 t23 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">highest</span> respect who claimed to have entirely
suppressed their passions. The only peculiarity in Gautama’s teaching
was that he made this <span class="t24 t25 hoverable">object</span> incumbent on all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> Buddhists alike,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> exception. And this <span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> of absolute imperturbability is <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span>
indicated to the eye by the usual attitude of the images which, after
Gautama’s death, were carved to represent him—an attitude of passionless
composure, and dignified calm.

In the interesting Pali <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> Milinda-pra?na (Milinda-pañho), containing
a conversation on the subject of Nirva?a between <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span> Milinda (Menander)
and the monk Nagasena (supposed to have lived about 140 B.C.), the
latter compares it to the pure <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> which quenches fire, and to the
fathomless Ocean freed from trouble and impurities, which no river,
however vast, can fill to overflowing; and to the Air, which cannot be
seen or explained, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> it enters our bodies and fills us with life;
and to Space, which is <span class="t0 t28 hoverable">eternal</span> and infinite, and beyond the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span>
to conceive.

I trust I shall not shock my Indian friends if I illustrate this
condition by a comparison of my own drawn from the animal creation. In
crossing the Indian Ocean, when unruffled by the slightest breeze, I
have sometimes observed a jelly-fish floating on the surface of the
transparent water, apparently lifeless. The creature is evidently
neither asleep nor awake. It certainly is not thinking about anything,
and its <span class="t0 t1 t13 t16 t24 t25 hoverable">consciousness</span> is doubtful. All that can be affirmed about it is
that it seems to be drinking in the warm fluid in a <span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> of lazy
blissful repose.

No Buddhist, at least, could look at such a sight <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> being reminded
of this <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> of Nirva?a—the <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> of, so to speak, floating in perfect
repose and peace and cessation from all pain, and all work, and even all
thought, on a <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of ocean of half conscious, half unconscious
beatitude. It is not consciousness, neither is it unconsciousness. It is
symbolized by a full-blown, perfectly formed lotus—a frequent emblem of
perfection—reposing on a calm mirror-like lake.

With regard to Pari-nirva?a[61]—the complete termination of migrations
and passing away of all the elements of bodily existence—if this is to
be distinguished from the Brahmanical <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> of absorption into an
impersonal spirit—whereby the Ego of personal identity is destroyed—it
is a distinction <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> much difference.

Strictly, however, in Buddhism the dissolution of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> leaves no
surviving personality or individuality, and consequently Pari-nirva?a is
not properly described either as absorption into a void (?unya) or as
annihilation. It is simply the absolute termination of a series of
conscious bodily organizations. The <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> himself evaded dogmatic
definitions, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> probably have said:—it is not life, neither is it
non-life; it may be compared to infinite space (?unya) which is not to
be comprehended or explained.

We should also bear in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> that although Nirva?a and Pari-nirva?a
constitute the ultimate goal to which all the morality of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span>

perhaps on that very part of this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> which is the scene of their
present toils, joys, and sorrows.

It only remains for me to caution those who may be impressed with the
beauty of some of the precepts of the moral code and its theory of
perfection, as ending in Pari-nirva?a, against deducing therefrom too
optimistic an estimate of the Buddhist system. Buddhist morality is like
a showy edifice built on the sand. It is a thoroughly fair-weather
structure, incapable of standing against flood, storm, and tempest.

It may be summed up in a few <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> as a scheme for the establishing of a
paradox—for the perfecting of one’s self by accumulating merit with the
ultimate <span class="t25 hoverable">view</span> of annihilating all <span class="t0 t1 t13 t16 t24 t25 hoverable">consciousness</span> of self—a system which
teaches the greatest respect for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of others, with the ultimate
<span class="t25 hoverable">view</span> of extinguishing one’s own.

It must, in short, be clearly understood that if any comparison be
instituted between Buddhism and Christianity in regard to the
self-abnegation, or self-sacrifice which each claims to inculcate, the
self to be got rid of in Buddhism is not the selfishness condemned by
Christianity, but rather the self of individuality—the self of
<span class="t22 t25 hoverable">individual</span> life, and personal identity.

To be righteous in a Christian <span class="t0 t1 t7 t12 t13 t14 t17 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">sense</span> a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> must be God-like, and to be
righteous in a Buddhistic <span class="t0 t1 t7 t12 t13 t14 t17 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">sense</span> a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> must be Buddha-like; but the
righteousness of the Buddhist is not the perfection of holiness by the
extinction of <span class="t2 t5 t8 t17 t18 t19 hoverable">sin</span> committed against God, but the perfection of
merit-making, with the <span class="t25 hoverable">view</span> of earning happiness for himself in a <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span>
<span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> hereafter.

For every Buddhist is like a trader who keeps a ledger, with a regular
debtor and creditor account, and a daily entry of profit and loss.

He must not take, make, or hoard money. He is forbidden to store up a
money-balance in a worldly bank, but he is urged to be constantly
accumulating a merit-balance in the bank of Karma.

In conclusion, let the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> enforce his own moral teaching in his own
way, by allegory and illustration drawn from real life:—When asked by a
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> ‘why he did not plough and sow and earn his own bread?’ he
replied to the following effect: ‘I do plough and sow and <span class="t6 hoverable">eat</span> immortal
fruit (Amata = Am?ita); my plough is <span class="t7 t8 t12 hoverable">wisdom</span> (pa??a); my shaft is
modesty; my draught-ox, exertion; my goad, earnest meditation (sati); my
mind, the rein. <span class="t7 t13 t19 t20 t29 hoverable">Faith</span> (saddha) in the doctrine is the seed I sow;
cleaving to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> is the weed I root up; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> is the destroyer of the
weed; Nirva?a and deliverance from misery are my harvest.’
(Kasi-bharadvaja-sutta of the Sutta-nipata.)

This may be compared with St. Luke viii. 11-15; but have we not here a
contrast rather than a comparison?

Perhaps some may think that the contrast is not unfavourable to
Buddhism. Nay, possibly some may complain that I have not enlarged
sufficiently on the remarkable resemblance between certain moral
precepts in the Buddhist code and in the Christian. I admit this
resemblance—I admit that both tell us:—not to <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> the world; not to
<span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> money; not to show enmity towards our enemies; not to do
unrighteous or impure acts—to overcome <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> by good, and to do to others
as we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be done by.

Nay, I admit even more:—I allow that some Buddhist precepts go beyond
the corresponding Christian injunctions. For Buddhism prohibits all
killing—even of animals and noxious insects. It demands total abstinence
from stimulating drinks—disallowing even moderation in their use. It
excludes all who aim at perfect sanctity from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">holy</span> estate of
matrimony. It bids a man, if he strives after perfection, abandon the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> and lead a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of monkhood. In fine, its morality is essentially
a monkhood-morality. It enjoins total abstinence, because it dares not
trust <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t0 t1 t15 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> to be temperate. How indeed could it trust them when
it promises them no help, no <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> grace, no restraining power?

The <span class="t3 t22 t28 hoverable">glory</span> of Christianity is that having freely given that grace and
that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> to man, it trusts him to make <span class="t1 hoverable">use</span> of the gift. It seems to
<span class="t6 t9 t11 t19 t20 t22 hoverable">speak</span> to him thus:—Thy Creator wills to trust <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thee</span> and to be trusted by
thee; He has endowed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thee</span> with freedom of choice, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> respects
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thy</span> liberty of action. He imposes no rule of total abstinence in regard
to natural desires; He simply bids <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thee</span> keep them <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">within</span> bounds, so that
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thy</span> moderation may be known <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">unto</span> all men; He places <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thee</span> in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span>
amid trials and temptations and says to thee, ‘My grace is sufficient
for thee’ and by its aid <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thou</span> mayest overcome them all.

Yes, the grand difference between the morality of Buddhism and the
morality of Christianity is not in the letter of the precepts, but in
the principle and motive <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> <span class="t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> to bear on their application.

Buddhism says:—Be righteous by yourselves, and through yourselves, and
for the getting rid of all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> in yourselves. Christianity says:—Be
righteous through the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of God’s gift of <span class="t0 t28 hoverable">eternal</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> in His Son. In
a word, Buddhism founds its morality on self. Christianity founds its
morality on Christ.

The <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> said to his followers:—Take nothing from me, trust to no one
but to yourselves.

<span class="t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t13 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">Christ</span> said, and says to us still:—Take all from me; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> this <span class="t1 t8 hoverable">free</span>
gift. Put on this spotless robe. <span class="t6 hoverable">Eat</span> this Bread of Life. Drink this
Living Water.

Think you that any one who receives a priceless gift, is likely
willingly to insult the Giver of it? Think you that any one who accepts
a snow-white robe is likely willingly to soil it by impure acts? Think
you that any one who tastes life-giving Bread is likely to relish husks?
or that any one who draws deep draughts at a living <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Well</span> is likely to
prefer the polluted <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> of a stagnant pool?

Beware, then, of judging by the mere letter; or, should you insist on so
judging, bear in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> that everywhere the Buddha’s <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Law</span> is a dead letter,
because the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> is dead; just as the Sermon on the Mount <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be a
dead letter, if <span class="t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t13 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">Christ</span> were dead.

Finally, let me say to the admirers of Buddhism:—

If you insist on placing its moral code on the same level with that of
Christianity, ask yourselves one plain question—Who <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be the more
likely to lead a godly, righteous, and sober life, a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of moderation
and temperance, a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of holiness and happiness—the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> who has learnt
his morality from the dead, the extinct Buddha, or the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> who draws his
morality and his holiness from the living, the eternal, the life-giving
Christ?




                              LECTURE VII.
        _Changes in Buddhism and its disappearance from India._


In the preceding Lectures I have confined myself chiefly to the
consideration of what may be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> _true Buddhism_ as taught by its
Founder and developed by his immediate followers and disciples during
the first <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> centuries of its existence in the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">land</span> of its
birth, India.

To attempt an explanation of all the subsequent phases of Buddhism
would, as I have before stated, require the command of unlimited time.
All I can hope to accomplish in the concluding Lectures is to give a
very general <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of the changes Buddhism underwent before
it died out in India, and of its corruptions in some of the countries
bordering on India and in North-eastern Asia.

And I may add that those who <span class="t0 t10 t11 t17 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">desire</span> correct views on this subject, ought
not to trust to mere inferences and theories founded on a critical
perusal of the so-called Sacred Books of the Buddhists. For it is
certain that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> any practical experience of what Buddhism has
become in modern times—I mean such an experience as can only be gained
by residing or travelling in countries where Buddhism now prevails—the
mere study of its <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> scriptures is likely to be misleading.

At the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> book-knowledge is indispensable, and it is essential to
<span class="t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t27 t29 hoverable">bring</span> to the study of later Buddhism a scholarlike acquaintance with
Sansk?it and Pali. Even a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of Tibetan ought to be added. Nor
ought the inquirer to be ignorant of the science of comparative
religion, seeing that the principles of that science may throw <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> on
many difficult questions.

For example, a student of comparative religion will be prepared to
expect that all religious systems will diverge more or less from their
original type in the <span class="t20 hoverable">hands</span> of enthusiastic disciples, who are ever
inclined to amplify their master’s teaching and to explain it
differently according to each man’s peculiar temperament and mental
bias, until in the end the original deposit of simple doctrine becomes
overlaid with layer <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> layer of adventitious matter.

Nor will he be surprised to <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> that the tendency of every religious
movement is towards deterioration and disintegration. Nor will it appear
strange to him that the chief conservative force is antagonism. As <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span>
goes on disagreements among the followers of any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> leader seem to be
inevitable, and always lead to sectarian divisions and subdivisions. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span>
it is this opposition of religious parties that usually operates to
mitigate the worst extremes of corruption, and tends to <span class="t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t27 t29 hoverable">bring</span> about
re-forming movements.

Even the progress of Christianity—as history shows too well—furnishes

Testament is likely to give a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> of the varying condition of the

But here it is important to caution the student of religions against
forcing a comparison between <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> systems of doctrine like Christianity
and Buddhism, which are radically and essentially opposed to each other.

The unchristianlike incrustations and divisions which have marred the
original teaching of the <span class="t1 t4 t9 t16 hoverable">Head</span> of our religion exist _in spite_ of
Christianity. They are not the result of any development of its first
principles; whereas, on the contrary, the corruptions and schisms of
Buddhism are the natural and inevitable outcome of its own root-ideas
and fundamental doctrines.

In proof of this let us revert for a moment to the insight we have
gained into the origin of Buddhism.

It will be seen that the most remarkable feature of the Buddha’s
teaching, so far as it has been stated in the preceding Lectures, was
that he altogether ignored the existence in <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of any

from the natural aspirations, affections, and instincts of humanity; and
of any force outside of <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> capable of aiding a man’s own
efforts in his struggle for salvation. Not that he reviled, or poured
contempt on the religion prevalent among his fellow-countrymen, but that
he found no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> in his system for an external Ruler and Controller of
the Universe, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have stultified his own teaching had he

their supplications.

If it were possible, in short, to condense into a categorical statement
the scattered utterances of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> teaching was rarely dogmatic, we

conduct for useless superstitious rites, but his moral code had no other

peculiar stoical philosophy had no other <span class="t24 t25 hoverable">object</span> than the removal of the
ignorance which obstructed the path to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> knowledge—the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> that

It is admitted, too, that its moral precepts were of a <span class="t17 t29 hoverable">high</span> order; but

do any of these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> when its only <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> of <span class="t2 t5 t8 t17 t18 t19 hoverable">sin</span> was not the infraction

consequences to the doer?

Furthermore, it was guilty of the inconsistency of bidding a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> cherish

while it made his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> salvation depend on his giving up all <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> for
wife and children, and setting before himself, as his final goal, a
condition of absolute indifference and inactivity.

What, therefore, I am at present concerned to point out is that, if the
essential doctrines of primitive Buddhism were of the character <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span>
summarized, a rebound from one extreme to another became inevitable, and
that such a reaction was due to the very <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of the original teaching
of its Founder. In point of <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> it was not a development that <span class="t2 t4 t6 t9 t18 t19 t22 hoverable">took</span>
place, but a recoil—like the recoil of a spring held down for a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> by
a powerful <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> and then released. And this resulted from the simple
working of the <span class="t0 t28 hoverable">eternal</span> instincts of humanity, which insisted on making
themselves felt notwithstanding the unnatural restraint to which the
<span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> had subjected them; so that every doctrine he taught developed by
a <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of irony of fate into a complete contradiction of itself.

Let us <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> a few examples:—

Buddhism, we know, started with the doctrine that all <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> of marriage,
or of happy home-life, was to be abandoned by <span class="t5 t8 hoverable">wise</span> men—by all who aimed
at becoming <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> Buddhists (in direct contradistinction, we may note, to
the primary Christian <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> that it is not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> for created <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> to be
alone, and that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> his Creator created a help meet for him—a

Church when He gave the first sign of His <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> commission at a
marriage ceremony).

What, then, followed on the Buddha’s original unnatural teaching in
regard to marriage?

Of course an immediate result was that, although according to the
Buddha’s ordinance any one who aimed at perfect sanctity was bound to
lead a celibate life, the rule against marriage was admitted to be
inapplicable to the majority of <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t0 t1 t15 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> living in the world. The
mass of the people, in short, were necessarily offenders against the
primary <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">law</span> of Buddhism. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Though</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> lay-Buddhists, they were not
‘wise men’ in the Buddhist <span class="t0 t1 t7 t12 t13 t14 t17 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">sense</span> of the term (pp. 86, 88). There is even
evidence that among certain monkish communities in Northern countries
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">law</span> against marriage was soon relaxed. It is <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> known that at the

monks, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> their nephews and nieces[62]. And far worse than
this, Buddhism ultimately allied itself with Tantrism or the <span class="t0 t5 t11 hoverable">worship</span> of
the female principle (?akti), and under its sanction encouraged the
grossest violations of decency and the worst forms of profligacy.

It was the same in regard to the unnatural vow of poverty. Monasteries
and Lamaseries now possess immense revenues, and monks are often wealthy
men.

Then again, what resulted from the Buddha’s ignoring the existence of a
God, and telling his disciples to abstain from depending on any Being
<span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> than what <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> himself could become? Of course this was opposed to
every man’s innermost <span class="t0 t1 t7 t12 t13 t14 t17 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">sense</span> of his own needs and of his own nature. For
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> is so constituted that he cannot be happy <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> loving and
trusting a Being <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> than himself—a Being who takes the initiative in

Nor can <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> in his secret <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">heart</span> regard either himself or any
one of his fellow-men as a being worthy of his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t22 t23 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">highest</span> adoration. Nor
can he <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> his affections on a blank or an abstraction. And so, in spite
of the Buddha’s teaching, his followers <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> act on their own
convictions. They <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> believe in <span class="t0 t1 t15 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> than themselves, and in
a personal Creator knowable and lovable by themselves, and knowing and
loving His creatures. Nay, they ultimately converted the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> himself
into the very <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> he denied, calling him ‘The chief <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">god</span> of all the gods’
(Devatideva).

Again, what was the effect of the Buddha’s leading <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> to believe that
all supernatural revelation was unneeded—that all enlightenment came
from within, and that every <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> was competent to think out <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span>
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> for himself by the exercise of his own reasoning powers, in
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> that the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> himself had done?

Of course the result was that the generality of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> who shrank from the
effort of thinking out <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> for themselves, and were wholly destitute
of any faculty for doing so, insisted on believing in a revelation from
an external power, and ended in attributing infallibility to the
Buddha’s own teaching, and worshipping the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Law</span> of Buddhism—as a visible
embodiment of their deceased teacher—with all the ardour of enthusiastic
bibliolatrists.

Furthermore, what followed on the Buddha’s denying that any prayer,
however earnest, could have any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> to modify the operation of natural
laws?

Of course <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> longed for some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of supplication to a <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> power,
and so the Buddha’s disciples not only composed prayer-formularies, but
invested the mere letters and syllables of such forms with an efficacy
which no other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> of religionists has ever <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> of attributing to
prayer of any kind.

They not only repeated mystical sentences, which were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> prayers,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> really mere charms, believing that an occult virtue was inherent
in the words, but invented a method of manufacturing such sentences
(Dhara?i) like marketable commodities.

They fabricated prayers, in fact, by machinery, inscribing them on
wheels or on rolls inserted in cylinders, which in the present <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> are
made to revolve by <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> or by the force of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> and wind, and will
possibly, with the spread of science, be impelled by steam-power, so
that each revolution may count for an infinite <span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span> of repetitions,
and be <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> down to the credit of the owner or manager of the mechanism.

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> again, what was the inevitable consequence of the Buddha’s rejection
of the doctrine that any benefit could accrue to <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t0 t1 t15 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> from
religious services conducted by regularly ordained priests, and of his
instituting in their stead an <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Order</span> of Monks, who were little better
than a community of drones, contributing nothing to the wealth of the
world, doing nothing of any utility to any one, and taught to regard
inaction as the path of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> wisdom?

Naturally, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> craved for <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> helpers, guides, and intercessors,
and so by degrees these very monks conducted elaborate religious
services, and a complicated hierarchy was organized in Tibet, even more
intricate and far-reaching in its ramifications than that of the modern
Romish Church.

And once more, what resulted from the Buddha’s objection to provide
visible images and material objects of worship, with a <span class="t25 hoverable">view</span> to stimulate
devotion or aid meditation?

Of course concrete and objective Buddhism of some <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> became a
necessity. It became essential to make concessions to the weakness and
infirmity of <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> nature, which required external aids, and declined to
be devoted to an ideal void, or to meditate on a pure abstraction. Even
the Founder of Buddhism himself seems to have felt, as we shall see,
that his hold on the memory of his followers <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> depend on their
venerating certain objects and symbols after his death. Unhappily for
the purity of Buddhism, but quite in conformity with the inveterate
tendencies of humanity, the Buddha’s disciples pushed veneration of
external objects to an extreme. They were not contented with mere
reverence shown to the relics of the Buddha’s burnt <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> and the shrines
containing them. They worshipped the tree under which he attained
Buddhahood, the seat on which he sat, the prints of his feet, his shadow
supposed to be impressed on rocks, the utensils he used, the books
containing the Law, the wheel which symbolized both the propagation and
the character of his doctrine, and finally bowed down before carved
representations of his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> and images of all kinds. It is remarkable
that in Buddhist countries idols are far more numerous than among any
other idolatrous <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> in the world.

Lastly, what resulted from the Buddha’s teaching that the ultimate end
to which men’s efforts ought to be directed was Nirva?a—that is, the
total extinction of all <span class="t22 t25 hoverable">individual</span> existence and personal identity?

Of course <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> instinctively recoiled from utter self-annihilation, and
so the Buddha’s followers ended in changing the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> of Nirva?a and
converting it from a condition of non-existence into a <span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> of hazy
beatitude in celestial regions, while they encouraged all men—whether
monks or laymen—to make a <span class="t0 t1 t7 t12 t13 t14 t17 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">sense</span> of dreamy bliss in heaven, and not total
extinction of life, the end of all their efforts.

But it was not only this natural and inevitable recoil to the opposite
extreme that ultimately <span class="t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> about an entire change in primitive
Buddhism. Another cause must also be <span class="t2 t5 t11 t18 t19 t23 t26 hoverable">taken</span> into account.

We have already explained the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of the tie which bound Buddhism to
Brahmanism, from the first <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> on which Gautama sat as a disciple at the
feet of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> philosophers Udraka and A?ara (p. 29). Now, although
this tie was soon loosened, and although the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> struck out a line of
his own, and a separation <span class="t2 t4 t6 t9 t18 t19 t22 hoverable">took</span> place, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> systems stood on so
much common ground that they were always ready to draw <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> again.

At all events, it is probable that one system never expelled the other,
and that the constant attrition and contact which <span class="t2 t4 t6 t9 t18 t19 t22 hoverable">took</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> between
Brahmanism and Buddhism, led to a considerable splitting up of the
original fabric of Buddhism, involving, of course, many divisions and
subdivisions of Buddhistic thought, some of which were closely allied to
the later developments of Brahmanical philosophy.

In the Sarva-dar?ana-sa?graha four principal sects of Buddhism are
enumerated, which must have <span class="t2 t5 t11 t18 t19 t23 t26 hoverable">taken</span> root early on Indian soil.

These four were the Vaibhashika, Sautrantika, Madhyamika, and Yogacara.
Of these the first <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> with their subdivisions[63] were realistic, and
were established—though not perhaps thoroughly formulated and
systematized—in very early times, <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> before the council of Kanishka;
while the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> later schools are described as idealistic, the Madhyamika
being a Buddhistic <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of the Vedanta philosophy, and the Yogacara
agreeing generally with the Yoga system.

Indeed there is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> evidence that Buddhism developed in India a greater
<span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span> of schools and phases of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> than Brahmanism itself. Some
authorities enumerate eighteen divisions (corresponding perhaps to the
eighteen original disciples, pp. 47-73) which existed in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> Kanishka’s
time—that is, in the first century of our era, while others specify
thirty-two; and in the fourth century we <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> the Chinese traveller
Fa-hien (p. 160) making allusion to as many as ninety-six (Dr. Legge’s
translation, p. 62).

We cannot wonder then that the author of the Sarva-dar?ana-sa?graha
expressed himself in rather strong language to the following effect:—

‘Though the venerated <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> be the only one teacher, his disciples are
manifold; just as when the <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t21 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">sun</span> has set, the thief and other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> doers,
the theological student and others understand that it is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> to <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span>
about their occupations, according to their several inclinations.’

Yet, after all, it was chiefly in the North, and in consequence of the
council held by Kanishka, India’s greatest Buddhist <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> after A?oka[64]
(see p. 69), that the original features of Buddhism underwent the
greatest change and became overlaid with coating after coating of
extraneous matter. It was there, in Northern regions, in the valley of
the Indus, that the Protean system <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Maha-yana arose, and grew, by
the operation of the usual laws of accretion, conglomeration,
disintegration, and reintegration, into a congeries of heterogeneous
doctrines, including the <span class="t0 t5 t11 hoverable">worship</span> of Bodhi-sattvas, deified saints, and
personal gods.

Naturally the adherents of this wider method spoke disparagingly of the
simpler system prevalent in the South, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> sacred books were the
Tri-pi?aka of Ceylon <span class="t2 t11 t15 t19 t25 t27 hoverable">written</span> in the <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> vernacular (Pali). That
system they designated Hina-yana, ‘the defective method,’ not denying
however that their own enlarged system grew out of and included the
simpler one.

There arose, too, a <span class="t26 hoverable">third</span> method, or ‘vehicle’ of salvation, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> ‘the

and, being a compromise between the other two, never gained many
adherents, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> it is still recognized in Tibet—the Tibetans often
speaking of Tri-yana, or ‘the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> vehicles.’

At all events, it is only necessary for practical purposes to recognize
the distinction of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Great</span> and Little Vehicle—the Maha-yana[65] and
the Hina-yana. And it may be stated generally that the inhabitants of
Nepal, Tibet, China, Manchuria, Mongolia, and Japan have always shown a
preference for the Maha-yana, or ‘Great Vehicle,’ while the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> of
Ceylon, Burma, and Siam have always preferred the ‘Little Vehicle.’

At the same time, it is important to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">note</span> that while the Buddhists of
Northern countries are supposed to be disciples of the Maha-yana or

greatly from that of the other, and that the countries nearest to India
have still further complicated the Maha-yana system by adopting mystical
doctrines, and introducing magic and other practices supposed to aid in
the acquisition of supernatural powers.

It must also be borne in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> that, although the Maha-yana or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Great</span>

these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> areas, even on Indian soil.

In point of <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> they were often intermixed, and the changes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span>

narratives of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> well-known Buddhist travellers from China.

Buddhism was introduced into China between 58 and 75 of our era[66], but
it was not till much later that Chinese pilgrims visited India—the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">holy</span>

The first traveller of whom we have any record was a certain Chinese
Buddhist monk named Fa-hien, who <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> out on a pilgrimage to India about
the year 399 of our era, with the definite <span class="t24 t25 hoverable">object</span> of searching for and
carrying back to China complete copies of the Vinaya or Rules of
discipline for the Order. He wrote a very simple and straightforward
<span class="t1 t11 t12 t13 t16 t18 t21 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of his travels[67]—which lasted for fourteen years—and of his
visits to all the spots in India held most sacred by Buddhists. He was
followed by a Chinese traveller of less mark, named Sang Yun, who
started about 518 A.D., and seems to have ended his journey at Peshawar,
or at least not to have penetrated much further South. Peshawar, we
know, was a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Buddhist centre, and there was a fine Stupa there,
containing the alms-bowl of Buddha. Then after another interval a much
more celebrated Chinese pilgrim named Hiouen Thsang[68] started for
India (A.D. 629-644). The narrative of his travels for about fifteen
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> is perhaps the best known and most commonly quoted of the three.
In Chang Yueh’s preface[69] to these travels Hiouen Thsang is described
as ‘a Doctor of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> Pi?akas, and is said to have translated 657

journeyed he learnt the dialects and investigated the deep secrets of
religion.’

All <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> travellers give information in regard to the prevalence of
Buddhism in India up to the seventh century of our era, and the
narratives of two—Fa-hien and Hiouen Thsang—are invaluable for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span>
they throw on the changes which Buddhism underwent in the interval of
their travels. Here and there the pilgrims exaggerate, especially when
they venture on numerical statistics or write from hearsay; but on the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> their accounts may be accepted, and we learn that Hiouen Thsang
found some monasteries in ruins which were flourishing in Fa-hien’s
time, and that the Maha-yana had supplanted the earlier <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of
Buddhism, or rather co-existed with it in many parts of the South as
<span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as of the North, and was to be found even in Ceylon[70].

And this brings us <span class="t3 hoverable">face</span> to <span class="t3 hoverable">face</span> with the greatest change of all—the
total dying out of Buddhism in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> of its origin. How is it to be
accounted for that no adherents of either the greater or lesser Buddhist
systems—of either the Maha-yana or Hina-yana—are to be found in India at
the present moment?

The problem is difficult of solution, and I can only offer a few
suggestions for its elucidation.

In the first place, I think it may be confidently asserted that the
disappearance of Buddhism from India was a very gradual process, and
unattended by any serious or violent religious revolution.

We have already alluded to the tolerant, liberal, and eclectic <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span>
which has characterized Buddhism ever since the period of its first
promulgation at Benares.

Such toleration of the doctrines and ideas of co-existing systems had
its advantages, especially in the early stages of the Buddhistic
movement. It certainly had a prophylactic effect in warding off violent
attacks, and helped to promote the diffusion of Buddhism throughout the
numerous countries to which it ultimately spread. In India itself, as we
have already seen, Buddhism was never aggressive or combative. Its motto
everywhere was persuasion and conciliation. Composure, tranquillity, and
absence of acrimony were stamped on all its features. The very
foundation on which it was reared—the very establishment of a celibate
monastic Order, by means of which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> was to be
propagated—had in it something altogether agreeable to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> and
usages of Brahmanism.

We have seen, too, that the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> <span class="t2 t4 t6 t9 t18 t19 t22 hoverable">took</span> care to show his respect for
Brahmanical traditions, even while promulgating a philosophical theory
and preaching doctrines opposed to all sacerdotalism, priestly
privileges, supernatural revelation, and Vedic ceremonial.

It does not, of course, follow that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> teacher, to whom the
majority of Asiatic races have for centuries looked as their chosen
example, had not the courage of his opinions, and was not competent to
fill the rôle of a religious reformer.

The real <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> was that he was too <span class="t5 t8 hoverable">wise</span> to enter <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> any open crusade
against inveterate customs and ideas. The peculiar calm of an Indian
atmosphere, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> occasionally disturbed by political storms sweeping
from distant regions, has rarely been stirred by violent religious
antagonisms. The various currents of Hindu religious <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> have flowed
peacefully side by side, and reformers have generally done their <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span>
quietly. As for Gautama, there can be little doubt that his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> career
was stamped with the impress of his early surroundings, and that he
imbibed his tolerant ideas from the Brahmanism in which he had been
trained.

It has been usual to blame the Brahmans for their arrogant
exclusiveness, but their arrogance has been rather shown in magnifying
their own caste-privileges and carrying them to an extravagant pitch,
than in preventing any discussion of their own dogmas, or in resenting
any dissent from them.

The very essence of Brahmanism was tolerance. Every <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of opinion was
admissible under a system which made every <span class="t0 t4 t5 t10 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">person</span> and every <span class="t24 t25 hoverable">object</span> in
existence manifestations of the one Being, Brahma.

The only delicate ground, on which it was dangerous for any reformer to
tread, was caste. The only unpardonable <span class="t2 t5 t8 t17 t18 t19 hoverable">sin</span> was infringement of
caste-rules. Nor was any one tempted to adopt the rôle of a violent
agitator, when all were <span class="t1 t8 hoverable">free</span> to express any opinion they liked <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span>
hindrance, provided they <span class="t2 t4 t6 t9 t18 t19 t22 hoverable">took</span> care to abstain from any act of
interference with caste-privileges.

It does not appear, in short, that the preachers of either Buddhism, or
Vaish?avism, or ?aivism, or ?aktism, or of any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of these sectarian
systems, ever incurred the special animosity of the Brahmans or of each
other, or ever indulged in very violent denunciations of each other’s
religious doctrines.

In real truth, these systems of doctrine were all evolved out of
Brahmanism. They were, therefore, not only tolerated by Brahmanism, but
accepted as the inevitable outcome of its own pantheistic creed.

No doubt each received at first a strong stamp of individuality from its
founder, marking it off from other systems, but with the lapse of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span>
the deeper shades of difference grew fainter. Then it became a question
which should become merged in the other. In such a competition between
rival systems Buddhism had less chance of holding its own than either
Vaish?avism or ?aivism; for its root-ideas—as we have seen—were not
rooted in the <span class="t0 t28 hoverable">eternal</span> instincts of <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> nature.

Buddhism, in fact, could never have maintained itself in India till the
twelfth or thirteenth century of our era, had it not gradually, and to a
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> extent through interaction with Vaish?avism and ?aivism, dropped
its unnatural pessimistic theory of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> and its unpopular atheistic
character, and accommodated itself to those systems.

But Buddhism in parting with its ultra-pessimism and its atheistic and
agnostic ideas, lost its chief elements of individuality and its chief
independent stand-point.

Vaish?avism, on the other hand, was quite alive to its own interests,
and had an eye to the spread of its own doctrines. It <span class="t2 t4 t6 t9 t18 t19 t22 hoverable">took</span> care to adopt
all the popular features of Buddhism. It vied with Buddhism in
inculcating universal love, toleration, liberality, benevolence, and
abstinence from injury. It preached equality, fraternity, and even in
some cases the abolition of caste distinctions. It taught a succession
of incarnations or rather descents (Avatara[71]) of <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> <span class="t0 t1 t15 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span>
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> (as Buddhism taught a succession of Buddhas), and it even adopted
the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> himself as one of the incarnations of Vish?u.

This, indeed, is the best explanation of what has happened at Puri in
Orissa, where a temple once dedicated to Gautama Buddha, and supposed to
contain a relic of his burnt body, was afterwards dedicated to the
Jagannath <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of K?ish?a and supposed to enshrine one of his bones, and
where low-caste and high-caste both <span class="t6 hoverable">eat</span> <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> the <span class="t0 t14 t23 t24 hoverable">food</span> cooked in the
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> of that popular god.

The same may be said of the interaction which <span class="t2 t4 t6 t9 t18 t19 t22 hoverable">took</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> between
Buddhism and ?aivism; for ?aivism, of course, was quite as bent on the
propagation of its own creed as other systems were. It vied with
Buddhism in encouraging abstract meditation, and although it had less
sympathy than Vaish?avism had with that system, it approached in some
respects so closely to its rival, that when Buddhism disappeared from
India, images of Gautama were converted into representations of ?iva
seated in profound contemplation.

Ultimately, the interaction between the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> systems proceeded to such
a point that each was influenced and modified by the other; each learnt
something, or adopted some practice from the other.

It was thus, too, that ?aktism, i. e. the <span class="t0 t5 t11 hoverable">worship</span> of energy or force
(?akti), identified with ?iva’s consort, was imported into Buddhism; its
doctrine of the self-evolution of all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> from Prak?iti having much
that harmonized with the Buddhist theory of the origin of the Universe.
Thus, too, even Tantrism in its worst forms became intermixed with
Buddhistic practice.

Enough, then, has been said to justify the assertion that Buddhism was
not forcibly expelled from India by the Brahmans. It simply in the
end—possibly as late as the thirteenth century of our era—became blended
with the systems which surrounded it, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> the process of blending was
gradual.

Professor E. B. Cowell has shown in his valuable Preface that both this
play and the sister Hindu play <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Ratnavali were probably put forth

It was also during the reign of ?iladitya that the immense monastery at
Nalanda near Raja-g?iha formed a seat of learning, which might suggest a
comparison with the learned monkish communities and even with the
universities of mediæval Europe[75]. In that monastery might be seen
several <span class="t6 hoverable">thousand</span> novices and monks of the eighteen Buddhist schools—all
of them supported by royal grants, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> enabled both to perform
their religious duties, and to prosecute the study of philosophy, law,
and science in literary ease. It is probable that if disputes and
disagreements <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> burning questions occurred, they rarely led to
serious conflicts, and were not general throughout India, but confined
to particular localities; and I think it may be safely affirmed that if
Buddhism was ever anywhere persecuted, it never anywhere persecuted in
return.

I myself was much struck in a visit I paid to Ellora in the Nizam’s
territory by the evidence I there saw of the friendly tolerance which
must have prevailed between Brahmans, Buddhists, and Jains. Brahmanical,
Buddhist, and Jaina caves are there seen side by side, and their inmates
no doubt lived on terms of fairly friendly tolerance, much as the
members of the Anglican, Roman Catholic, and Wesleyan communions live in
Europe at the present day.

Even at Benares, the stronghold of Brahmanism, I witnessed similar
proofs of amicable mutual intercourse, and at Nasik—the Benares of
Western India—the proximity of the Buddhist caves and ruined monasteries
which I visited, made it abundantly clear that Brahmans and Buddhists
agreed to differ and to avoid serious quarrels.

It must nevertheless be admitted, that in the extreme South of India,
and perhaps eventually at Benares and a few other strongholds of
Brahmanism, the difference between the systems became so accentuated as
to lead to grievous conflicts. <span class="t0 t5 t8 t10 t14 t15 t21 t24 t28 hoverable">Whether</span> blood was shed it is impossible
to prove; but it is alleged, with some degree of probability, that
violent crusades against Buddhism were instituted by Kumarila and
?a?kara—two well-known Southern Brahmans noted for their bigotry—in the
seventh and eighth centuries of our era. It does not appear, however,
that they were very successful either in the conversion or extermination
of Buddhists.

It may, I think, be confidently affirmed that what ultimately happened
in most parts of India was, that Vaish?avas and ?aivas crept up softly
to their rival and drew the vitality out of its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> by close and
friendly embraces, and that instead of the Buddhists being expelled from
India, Buddhism gradually and quietly lost itself in Vaish?avism and
?aivism. In fact, by the beginning of the thirteenth century very little
Buddhism remained on Indian soil. In a philosophical drama, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> ‘the
Rise of the Moon of Knowledge’ (Prabodha-candrodaya), <span class="t2 t11 t15 t19 t25 t27 hoverable">written</span> probably
about the twelfth century, the approaching triumph of Brahmanism over
Buddhism is clearly indicated; for the Buddhist and other heretical
sects are represented as belonging to the losing side.

Yet, after all, it is scarcely correct to say that Buddhism ever wholly
died away in India. Its name indeed perished there, but its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span>
survived, and its sacred places remain to this day. Its ruined temples,
monasteries, monuments, and idols are scattered everywhere, while some
of these have been perpetuated and adopted by those later phases of
Hinduism which its own toleration helped to <span class="t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t27 t29 hoverable">bring</span> into existence.

At all events it may be safely affirmed that the passing away of the
Buddhistic system in India was on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> like the peaceful passing
away of a moribund <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> surrounded by his relatives, and was at least
unattended with any agonizing pangs[76].




                             LECTURE VIII.
             _Rise of Theistic and Polytheistic Buddhism._


In the preceding Lecture we have endeavoured to show generally how
Buddhism was evolved out of Brahmanism, how it flourished side by side
with Brahmanism, and how after a chequered career and protracted
senility in the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">land</span> of its birth—lasting for at least fifteen
centuries[77]—it ultimately merged its individuality in Vaish?avism and
?aivism, or, in other words, disappeared and became lost in a composite
system <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Hinduism.

We have now to trace more closely the gradual sliding of a simple
agnostic and atheistic creed, into a variety of theistic and
polytheistic conceptions.

We have already seen how the expansion of the Hina-yana into the
Maha-yana became an inevitable result of the Buddha’s own teaching—in
other words, how a rebound from atheism to theism was as unavoidable as
the return swing of a heavy pendulum. We need only repeat here that it
could not have been otherwise, when a teacher, who never claimed to be
more than a man, attempted to indoctrinate his <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> followers with
principles opposed to the inextinguishable instincts and <span class="t0 t28 hoverable">eternal</span>
intuitions of humanity.

In <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> the teachers of the Maha-yana school were not slow to perceive
that, if Buddhism was to gain any hold over the masses, it was essential
that it should adapt itself to their <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> needs. It became imperatively
necessary, as a simple preservative measure, to convert a cold
philosophical creed, based on an ultra-pessimistic theory of existence,
into some sort of belief in the value of <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> as worth living. And
if <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> was not to be an invariable current of misery it followed that
there must also be some sort of <span class="t7 t13 t19 t20 t29 hoverable">faith</span> in a superintending <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span>
controlling that life, and interesting Himself in Man’s welfare.

Unfortunately, having once advanced beyond definite limits, the more
progressive teachers found it impossible to draw the line at any given
point.

No doubt the theistic movement began by simple saint-worship—that is, by
veneration for the extinct <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> as for a perfect saint. This was
accompanied by homage offered to his relics and to various memorials of
his person.

Then mere veneration and homage led to actual worship, and the Buddha,
who from first to last made his own perfect humanity an essential
principle of his teaching, became elevated to a pinnacle far above
humanity and converted into a veritable god.

Next, it is easy to see that a further development of the theistic
movement became inevitable.

For indeed it was only natural that in process of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> some of the more
eminent of the Buddha’s followers should become almost equally revered
with himself. It was not, however, till some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> after their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> that
they received any homage resembling that accorded to their Master.

It was then that, instead of being <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> of as extinct, according to
the orthodox Buddhist doctrine, they were continually elevated in the
imagination of their admirers to heavenly regions of beatitude.

Of course this constant increase of saint-worship tended to <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">land</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> by
degrees in a mass of theistic and polytheistic conceptions.

And polytheism could not prevail in Eastern countries <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> its usual
reverse side—polydemonism; and polydemonism could not prevail <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span>
its usual adjuncts of mysticism and magic. And all of these again
entailed idolatry, relic-worship, fetish-worship, and various other
gross superstitions.

Such was the natural termination of the process of degeneration. Let us
now trace it more in detail.

And in the first <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> it must not be forgotten that Gautama himself
seems to have foreseen this result.

He seems to have been quite aware of the ineradicable tendency inherent
in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> beings, impelling them to elevate their saints
and heroes to the position of gods. He <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> <span class="t2 t4 t6 t9 t18 t19 t22 hoverable">took</span> pains to make his

Accordingly we learn from <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> inscriptions that for many <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span>
afterwards the only allowable <span class="t24 t25 hoverable">object</span> of veneration among primitive
Buddhists was the Law—that is, the precepts, rules, and ordinances
propounded by Gautama himself—many of which may have been committed to
writing in early times, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> oral transmission was at first the usual
rule, as it was among Brahmans.

In time, however, the interconnexion between Brahmanism and Buddhism,
and the tendency to group sacred objects in triads[78], which showed
itself very early in Hindu religious <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> and mythology, seems to
have led to the <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> of a corresponding triple arrangement of venerated
objects among Buddhists. Hence <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> precious things—sometimes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span>
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> jewels (_tri-ratna_), or the ‘three Holies[79]’—came first to
be held in honour and then actually worshipped; a <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of personality
being accorded to all three, very similar to that supposed to belong to
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> chief <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> of the Hindu Pantheon.

This triad of personalities consisted of (1) the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> himself, that is
to say, Gautama Buddha, or the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> of the present age of the world;
(2) his Dharma or Law, that is, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> and doctrine of the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span>
personified, or so to <span class="t6 t9 t11 t19 t20 t22 hoverable">speak</span> incarnated and manifested in a visible <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span>
after his Pari-nirva?a; and (3) his Sa?gha or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Order</span> of monks, also in a
manner personified—that is, embodied in a <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of ideal impersonation or
collective unity of his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> disciples.

This last word, Sa?gha, which means in Sansk?it ‘a collection’ or
‘assemblage,’ is sometimes, as we have already seen (p. 85), very
unsuitably rendered by the expression ‘Buddhist Church.’ It simply
denotes ‘the collective <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> of Buddhist monks;’ that is to say, the
entire monastic fraternity, comprising in its widest <span class="t0 t1 t7 t12 t13 t14 t17 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">sense</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span>

carefully borne in mind—the still vaster community of living persons
constituting the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> of the Buddhist laity.

These three, then,—the Buddha, his Law, and his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Order</span> of Monks,—passed
into the first <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> personifications of early theistic Buddhism,
commonly known as the first Buddhist Triad.

Hence we <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> that the Khuddaka-pa?ha or ‘lesser readings[80]’ of the
fifteen divisions of the Khuddaka-nikaya (p. 63) begins thus:—

‘I put my trust in the Buddha, in the Law, in the Order’ (repeated <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span>

‘Ye <span class="t0 t1 t15 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> (Bhutani) here assembled of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> and air, let us bow, let us
bow before the Buddha, revered by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> and men. May there be prosperity!

‘Ye <span class="t0 t1 t15 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> and air, let us bow before the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Order</span> of Monks.’

When Fa-hien was on his return home and in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> peril at sea, he
committed his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> to the protection of the Sa?gha, saying:—‘I have
travelled far in search of the Law, let me, by your dread and
supernatural power, return from my wanderings and reach my
resting-place.’

And again, on ending his travels, he gratefully acknowledged that he had
been guarded in his perils by the dread <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of the ‘three honoured
ones’ or ‘three precious ones’ or ‘three Holies’—thus acknowledging the
personality of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Law</span> as <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as of the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> himself and of the

But it must be borne in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> that this did not necessarily imply any
<span class="t0 t5 t11 hoverable">worship</span> of images. It is certain that for a <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> even <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span>
himself was not represented visibly. This is proved by the sculptures on
the Bharhut Stupa. Even in the present <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> the simple expression of
trust in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> revered ones constitutes the only formula of <span class="t0 t5 t11 hoverable">worship</span>
current in Ceylon. It is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> that images of the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> are now common
in that country, and while travelling there I saw numbers of persons
<span class="t6 hoverable">offering</span> homage and flowers to these images. But no prayer was addressed
to them, and I noticed no visible representations of the personified <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Law</span>
or Sa?gha[82].

Nor, when I was at the Buddhist monastery near Darjiling, did I see any
image of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Law</span> side by side with that of Gautama, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> every <span class="t6 t8 t10 t11 t16 t20 t21 t27 t28 hoverable">book</span>
examined by me in the temple-library began with the words:—Namo
Buddhaya, ‘reverence to the Buddha;’ namo Dharmaya, ‘reverence to the
Law;’ namo Sa?ghaya, ‘reverence to the Order.’ The only visible symbol
of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> so-called ‘Holies’ was a <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> staff with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> prongs, like
the Indian Tri-?ula.

It seems clear, therefore, that while, in process of time, images of
Gautama <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> were multiplied everywhere—and, as we shall see, in
various attitudes and shapes—images of the personified <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Law</span> and Sa?gha
were never common, and indeed rarely found, except among Northern
Buddhists. Those images of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Law</span> which I have examined are in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span>
of a man[83] with four arms and hands, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> of which are folded in
worship, while one holds a <span class="t6 t8 t10 t11 t16 t20 t21 t27 t28 hoverable">book</span> (or sometimes a lotus) and the other a
rosary[84].

Sometimes, however, the representation of a <span class="t6 t8 t10 t11 t16 t20 t21 t27 t28 hoverable">book</span> alone is held to be a
sufficient symbol of the Law.

The Sa?gha, on the other hand, is generally symbolized by the image of a
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> arms and hands, one of which, as in the images of Buddha,
rests on the knees and the other holds a lotus.

And it may be observed here that of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> images of the Buddha, the
Law, and the Order, sometimes one occupies the central position and
sometimes the other. This circumstance has led scholars to <span class="t6 t9 t11 t19 t20 t22 hoverable">speak</span> of what
it is the fashion to term a Buddhist trinity; but in real <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> neither
Buddhism nor Brahmanism has any trinity in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> of the term,
for although Buddhists claim a <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of tri-unity for their triad, and
say that the first contains the second, and that the <span class="t26 hoverable">third</span> proceeds from
the first <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> and contains them, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> the first is clearly never regarded
as either the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Father</span> or Creator of the world, in the Christian sense.

It appears, in fact, that the earliest Buddhist <span class="t0 t5 t11 hoverable">worship</span> was exactly what
might have been expected to follow on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> of a religious Reformer
and author of a new system. It was merely the natural expression of deep

The mere <span class="t6 hoverable">offering</span> of homage, either to a system of Law, or to a
community of living monks or to departed <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> saints—even <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> their

bereavement, or calamity. This <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of simple Buddhism might have
satisfied the needs of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> in times of peace and prosperity. Under other
conditions it broke down. It could offer no shelter and give no help
amid the storms and tempests of life. Hence the development of the later
phases of the Maha-yana system, the chief feature of which was a marked
change in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> attached to the term ‘Bodhi-sattva.’

This change will be better understood if we go back to what has already
been mentioned (at p. 98). We have before explained that, according to
the original theory of Buddhism, a Bodhi-sattva is one who has <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span>
(derived from self-enlightening intellect) for his essence; that is, he
is a being who through all his bodily existences is destined in some
final existence to become a Buddha, or self-enlightened man. Until his
final birth, however, a Bodhi-sattva is a being in whom <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span>
is rather latent and undeveloped than perfected. Gautama had been a
Bodhi-sattva of this character (see p. 134), the merit of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> actions
(Karma) in each of his countless previous existences (see p. 109) had
been transmitted to succeeding corporeal forms, till in the <span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span>
immediately preceding his last birth on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> he existed as a
Bodhi-sattva in the Tushita <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heaven</span> (see p. 120). There he continued
until the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> came for him to be <span class="t9 t24 hoverable">born</span> on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> as the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> of the
present age, when he entered the right side of his mother in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of
a white elephant (p. 23)[85].

And it may be repeated here that the white elephant, as something rare
and beautiful of its kind, was simply symbolical of the perfect
Arhatship which he was destined to achieve in the ensuing birth.

Born, then, at last as the child Gautama, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> of ?uddhodana, and
purified by a <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> observance of the six transcendent virtues (p. 128),
he ultimately attained to perfect <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> and Arhatship under the
Bodhi-tree, and in so attaining passed from the condition of a
Bodhi-sattva to that of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t22 t23 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">highest</span> of all Arhats—a supreme Buddha.
Then, after about forty-five <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> of diligent discharge of his
self-imposed task as a teacher of the right <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> of salvation, he
ultimately passed away in Pari-nirva?a, or absolute non-existence.

It is important, however, to remember, that at the moment of his
attaining Buddhahood he had transferred the Bodhi-sattvaship to
Maitreya, ‘the loving and compassionate one,’ who became the
Buddha-elect, dwelling and presiding as his predecessor had done in the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heaven</span> of contented <span class="t0 t1 t15 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> (Tushita; see p. 120). There he watches over
and promotes the interests of the Buddhist faith, while awaiting the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> when he is to appear on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> as Maitreya, or the fifth <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> of
the present age. His advent will not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> till the lapse of five

become so corrupt that the Buddhist <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Law</span> will be no more obeyed, nor even
remembered.

No wonder then that this Maitreya—whose very name implies <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> and
tenderness towards mankind, and who was destined to become, like
Gautama, a Saviour of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> by teaching its inhabitants how to save
themselves—became a favourite <span class="t24 t25 hoverable">object</span> of personal <span class="t0 t5 t11 hoverable">worship</span> after Gautama
Buddha’s death. Even when the <span class="t0 t5 t11 hoverable">worship</span> of other Bodhi-sattvas was
introduced, Maitreya retained the distinction of being the only
Bodhi-sattva worshipped by all Buddhist countries, <span class="t0 t5 t8 t10 t14 t15 t21 t24 t28 hoverable">whether</span> in the South
or in the North. Not that Gautama’s memory was neglected. He was, of
course, held to be superior to Maitreya, who was still a mere
Bodhi-sattva or Buddha-designate. But the feeling towards Gautama
Buddha, after his Nirva?a and death, became different, and the <span class="t24 t25 hoverable">object</span> of
bringing flowers and offerings to his shrines was simply to honour the
memory of a departed, not an existing saint. It was a mere mechanical
act, fraught with beneficial consequences, but not supplying any real
religious need. On the other <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> actual prayers were addressed to
Maitreya, as to a living merciful being, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> favour it was
all-important to secure, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heaven</span> was believed to be a region of
perfect <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> and contentment, to which all his worshippers were
admitted.

In Hiouen Thsang’s Travels a heavenly ?ishi is represented as
saying:—‘No <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> can describe the personal beauty of Maitreya. He
declares a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">law</span> not different from ours. His exquisite voice is soft and
pure. Those who hear it can never tire; those who listen are never
satiated[86].’

In fact, the aspirations of few pious Buddhists in early times ever led
them to soar <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> than the happiness of living with Maitreya and
listening to his voice in his own Tushita heaven.

It is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> that afterwards when the <span class="t0 t5 t11 hoverable">worship</span> of the Dhyani-Buddha
Amitabha came into vogue in Northern countries this Buddha’s heaven,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Sukhavati, fabled to be somewhere in the Western sky, seems to
have <span class="t2 t5 t11 t18 t19 t23 t26 hoverable">taken</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heaven</span> of Maitreya. But this belongs to a
later phase of Buddhism, to be explained when we <span class="t6 t9 t11 t19 t20 t22 hoverable">speak</span> of the
Dhyani-Buddhas (p. 203).

It was for Maitreya’s Tushita <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heaven</span> that Hiouen Thsang, and other
devout <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> of his day, prayed on their death-beds, and the one Chinese
inscription found at Buddha-Gaya is <span class="t10 t16 hoverable">full</span> of expressions indicative of
the same longing[87].

If then, we are able to enter into the feelings of Buddhists everywhere
in depending on the living, loving, and energizing Maitreya, rather than
on the extinct <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> who existed only in their memories, we shall <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span>
it less difficult to understand how it came to <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t11 t12 t19 t22 hoverable">pass</span> that the <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> of, so
to speak, canonizing every <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> saint or popular <span class="t1 t4 t9 t16 hoverable">head</span> of a monastic
community, and elevating him at <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> to the position of a Bodhi-sattva
like Maitreya, living in permanent regions of bliss, and able to help
his votaries to the same position, came into vogue.

It may make the course of development of Theistic Buddhism clearer if we
here revert to the early constitution of the Buddhist monastic
brotherhood, and endeavour to show how the homage paid to eminent and
saint-like <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> led, first to the multiplication of Bodhi-sattvas, and
then to polytheism and every <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of polytheistic superstition.

A <span class="t10 t16 hoverable">full</span> explanation of the early monastic system is given in the learned
<span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> of Koeppen[88]. It is clear that as <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> as Gautama was alive he
was the sole <span class="t1 t4 t9 t16 hoverable">Head</span> of the brotherhood of monks. After his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> the
Headship (as in the Christian brotherhood after the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> of Christ) was
not assigned to any one leader. The <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> himself forbade this. The
term Sa?gha at that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> merely denoted a republican fraternity of
monks, bound by no irrevocable vows and subject to no hierarchical
Superior, but all intent on following the example, and propagating the
doctrines of their departed leader. Soon, however, the formation of
separate centres of union and teaching became inevitable, and the term
Sa?gha was then applied to each separate society, and sometimes even to
a separate Conclave of each society, as <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> body. It
seems at least certain that each monastic association had the right to
admit monks, to hear confession, and to excommunicate. Naturally, too,
in course of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> it became necessary for each <span class="t5 t11 hoverable">society</span> to have some sort
of governing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> and choose a <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of president, and this presiding
officer was originally the senior monk, and accordingly had the simple
title of Sthavira (Thera), ‘Elder.’ This title appears to have been
introduced immediately after Gautama’s death.

It is believed that ever since the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> A?oka, Sthaviras or
Elders who became actual superintendents of monasteries, exercised
administrative powers, like those of Abbots; each over his own monastic
community. This was the first <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of Headship recognized. It was simply
a superiority of age.

As to any still <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of authority corresponding to that of Pope,
Archbishop, or Bishop, and extending over several monasteries, this did
not belong to early Buddhism or to its earliest developments. Lists of
uninterrupted series of pretended Buddhist Hierarchs exist, but are mere
fanciful fabrications. Nevertheless, it is certainly a historical <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span>
that along with the superiority of mere age, seniority, and experience,
there rapidly grew up _pari passu_ a superiority of knowledge, learning,
and sanctity, which were generally, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> not invariably, combined in
the <span class="t0 t4 t5 t10 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">person</span> of the presiding Elder.

Any one, in fact, who was distinguished for the practice of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t22 t23 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">highest</span>
degree of meditation, for complete acquaintance with the Law, for
special purity of conduct, and perfect fulfilment of the precepts, was
naturally elevated above the class of ordinary Bhikshus. Such a monk was
from the earliest times dignified by the title Arhat, ‘very reverend,’
i. e. more worthy of honour than the generality. Arhat, in short, was
from the first a name for the <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> grade of saint-like Bhikshu. Such a
man, too, before long, was raised to a still <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> level in the
estimation of his fellow-monks. He was believed to have delivered
himself from all the consequences of acts, <span class="t0 t5 t8 t10 t14 t15 t21 t24 t28 hoverable">whether</span> bad or good—from all
the fetters (see p. 127) of life, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> from all re-birth. He
was even elevated to a still loftier pinnacle. He was believed by his
superstitious admirers to possess unlimited dominion over nature, space,
time, and matter; to be all-seeing, all-powerful, and capable of working
every <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of miracle. Then, of course, at <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> he passed away in
Pari-nirva?a and was, so to speak, canonized. Be it noted, however, that
such canonization was never accorded to an Arhat till after his
departure from the world.

Probably the immediate disciples of Gautama Buddha—that is, his
so-called ‘great pupils’ (see p. 47), were all considered perfect
Arhats. And these perfect Arhats were probably the only saints of the
earliest period of Buddhism. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> there was one who surpassed them all by
an immeasurable interval, and that one was Gautama <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> himself. It
was the distinguishing mark of a supreme <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> that he was infinitely
greater than all other Arhats, because he had not only gained perfect
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> himself, but had become the Saviour of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> by
imparting to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of how they were to save themselves.

It seems, therefore, only natural that the followers of Buddha, and
probably the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> himself, before his decease, should have <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> it
desirable to establish a more systematic gradation of saintship by
filling up the immense gap between ordinary Arhats and the supreme
Buddha. It was this that led to the <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> of Pratyeka-Buddhas, that is,
self-dependent solitary Buddhas[89] (see p. 134), as <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as to the
notion of a still <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> being <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> a Bodhi-sattva, who, as the
Buddha-designate and future successor of Gautama, occupied a still more
exalted intermediate position than a Pratyeka-Buddha.

Of course it became difficult to fix on any living man, or any recently
deceased saint worthy of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t22 t23 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">highest</span> stage of Bodhi, to which a being
about to become a perfect <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> was supposed to attain.

The first to be so elevated (though apparently not by Gautama himself)
was, as frequently mentioned before, the mythical <span class="t22 t25 hoverable">individual</span> Maitreya.
He was, we repeat, for a <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> the only Bodhi-sattva recognized by
all Buddhists alike, <span class="t0 t5 t8 t10 t14 t15 t21 t24 t28 hoverable">whether</span> adherents of the Hina-yana or Maha-yana.
But he was not a historical personage, like Gautama or his immediate
disciples. He was a mere mythological personification of that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> of
love—of that kindly and friendly disposition towards all living <span class="t0 t1 t15 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span>
by force of which Buddhism hoped one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> to conquer the world, and win
it over to itself.

And in conformity with his mythical character, and probably to prevent
the rivalry of pretenders among future ambitious heads of monasteries,
he was not to appear for five <span class="t6 hoverable">thousand</span> years, till the teaching of
Gautama had lost its power.

Indeed, it was only to be expected that this rank should at first have
been accorded to one <span class="t0 t4 t5 t10 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">person</span> alone—just as in worldly affairs there could
be only one Heir-apparent to the throne.

Such was the more simple doctrine of early Buddhism in regard to the
relative position of the members of the Buddhist community.

How then did the teachers of the Maha-yana proceed to amplify this
doctrine?

They taught that there were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> methods of salvation or, so to speak,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> ways or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> vehicles—the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Great</span> and the Little (Maha-yana and
Hina-yana)—and indeed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> Bodhis or forms of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> which these
vehicles had to convey[90]. The former was for ordinary persons, the
latter for <span class="t0 t1 t15 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> of larger talents and <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> powers. The
‘Little Way’ was the simple doctrine, which had many Arhats but only one
Bodhi-sattva; the ‘Great Way,’ on the other hand, was the wider and
broader, which had many Bodhi-sattvas as <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as many Arhats. He who
satisfied the usual requirements of Saintship received the rank of an
Arhat in both systems. But in the wider system every one who aimed at
unusual sanctity on the one hand, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> (Bodhi) on the other,
might walk on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Great</span> road leading to Bodhi-sattvaship, and receive
the title Bodhi-sattva.

We have seen (p. 136) that the Hina-yana, or ‘Little system,’ taught
that there were only twenty-four Buddhas who had preceded Gautama. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Three</span>
of these (viz. Kraku-cchanda, Kanaka-muni, and Ka?yapa), with Gautama as
a fourth, had appeared in the present age, and only one Bodhi-sattva
(Maitreya) was to come.

But according to the ‘Great System,’ it was a mistake to limit the
acquisition of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t22 t23 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Saintship in this manner. It maintained that
there <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be numberless supreme Buddhas (and, in addition to them,
self-taught, solitary Buddhas, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Pratyeka-Buddhas), as <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as
numberless Bodhi-sattvas, even in the present age of the world. In other
words, it propounded the doctrine that the practice of the six (or ten)
transcendent virtues (p. 128), and especially the acquisition of
transcendent <span class="t7 t8 t12 hoverable">wisdom</span> (prajña paramita), might qualify many saints for the
attainment of Bodhi-sattvaship and Buddhaship. According to one theory,
there were to be at least a <span class="t6 hoverable">thousand</span> Bodhi-sattvas, followed by a
<span class="t6 hoverable">thousand</span> Buddhas, while, according to others, Buddhas and Bodhi-sattvas
were to be reckoned by myriads.

But this theory of numberless Bodhi-sattvas involved an entirely new
<span class="t25 hoverable">view</span> of their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> and of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> of the term.

In fact, the Bodhi-sattvas of the more developed Maha-yana school were
not Bodhi-sattvas at all, according to the strict <span class="t0 t1 t7 t12 t13 t14 t17 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">sense</span> of the term. It
is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> they resembled the genuine Bodhi-sattva in having gone through a
<span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> series of existences leading them at last to perfect saintship and
to a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heaven</span> of their own, but they were under no obligation to give up
their Bodhi-sattvaship, quit their celestial abodes, or descend
ultimately as <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> Buddhas <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> earth.

Furthermore, they never appeared to aim at Pari-nirva?a like their
earthly counterparts. Their most obvious _raison d’être_ seems to have
been to supply the need of personal objects of worship, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> in
Tibet they were believed to have their own secondary corporeal
emanations—sometimes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> their ‘incarnations,’ but more properly
described as descents (avatara) of portions of their essence in a
constant succession of <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> saints,—they never really <span class="t1 t7 t12 t29 hoverable">left</span> their own
permanent stations in the heavenly regions. Indeed, it is probable that
the chief cause of their popularity, as personal objects of adoration,
was that they were able to help their worshippers to attain to the same
permanent and unchangeable regions of bliss.

It was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> that the ‘Great Vehicle’ <span class="t2 t4 t6 t9 t18 t19 t22 hoverable">took</span> up an attitude which raised it
not only above the simple effort to suppress the passions and desires,
but also above the hopeless Nihilism of early Buddhism; for it soon
became the fashion for the most devoted and pious of Buddhist monks to
aspire to the title and actual blessedness of Bodhi-sattvaship rather
than to the doubtful blessedness of utter personal annihilation involved
in Buddhahood. At any rate the numerous Bodhi-sattvas of the ‘Great
Method’ appear to have remained quite contented with their condition, so
<span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> as it involved perpetual residence in the heavens, and quite
willing to put off all <span class="t0 t10 t11 t17 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">desire</span> for Buddhahood and Pari-nirva?a.

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Without</span> doubt, this more amplified system was the result of a reaction
of Brahmanism on Buddhism. It was at first a mere plan for creating a
close Hierarchy like that of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> caste—that is to say, a
privileged class of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> possessed of <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> and sanctity and
superior to the majority of Bhikshus of the common stamp. Then it soon
developed into a scheme for satisfying the craving of the masses for
divinities of some <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> to whom they might appeal for help in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of
need.

In all probability the first to receive the title of Bodhi-sattva, next
to Maitreya, were the most celebrated Arhats before mentioned, who were
immediate disciples of Gautama, not however till <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> had separated
them from their <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> frames, when, as a matter of course, they received
a <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of <span class="t0 t5 t11 hoverable">worship</span> like that accorded to all leaders of men, just as the
earliest saints, heroes, and teachers of Brahmanism did.

To specify all the Arhats who were elevated to the rank of Bodhi-sattva
and became objects of veneration in later times <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be a difficult and
unprofitable task.

We may also dismiss, as unworthy of note, statements such as that in the
Lalita-vistara, in which it is declared that 32,000 Bodhi-sattvas joined
the Buddha’s assembly in the Jetavana garden. But we may notice the
quasi-deification of a few historical personages mentioned by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span>

the fourth to the seventh centuries has been so often quoted.

First of all came the immediate followers and so-called ‘great pupils’
(see p. 47) of Gautama, namely, his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> chief disciples, ?ari-puttra and
Moggallana (Maudgalyayana = Modgala-puttra)[91], both of whom are
believed to have died before him. Then came the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> leaders at
the first Council: 1. Ka?yapa (pp. 46, 55); 2. Gautama’s cousin and
beloved pupil Ananda; 3. Upali (note, p. 56).

Next to these perhaps the most celebrated teacher elevated to
Bodhi-sattvaship was Nagarjuna[92]—noticed before as the alleged founder
of the Maha-yana system and its introducer into Tibet. According to one
<span class="t1 t11 t12 t13 t16 t18 t21 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> he was the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> of Vidarbha, and taught Buddhism in
the south of India. He had a celebrated disciple named Deva (or
Arya-deva)[93]. Nagarjuna was at any rate a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> teacher and developer
of the Maha-yana. A legend relates that he was skilled in magic, and was
able thereby to prolong his own and a Southern Indian king’s <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span>
indefinitely. This caused <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> grief to the mother of the
Heir-apparent, who instigated her <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> to ask Nagarjuna for his own head.
Nagarjuna complied with the request, and cut his own <span class="t1 t4 t9 t16 hoverable">head</span> off with a
blade of Ku?a grass, nothing else having the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> to injure him. He is
said by Hiouen Thsang to have lived in Southern Ko?ala about 400 <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span>
after the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> of Gautama, and is worshipped under different epithets
in Tibet, China, Mongolia, and even Ceylon. Probably he lived in the
first or <span class="t0 t2 t5 t13 t14 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">second</span> century—Beal places him between A.D. 166 and 200.
Wassiljew considers him a wholly mythical personage. The additions he
made to Buddhist doctrines were undoubtedly great. When he died Stupas
were erected to his memory, and in some places he was even worshipped as
Buddha.

Among other deified, or partially deified Bodhi-sattvas, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> images
and Stupas (p. 161) the Chinese pilgrims found scattered in various
parts of India, may be mentioned, those of the mythical Buddhas who
preceded Gautama, especially Ka?yapa[94]. Then we have Rahula (son of
Gautama), the patron of all novices, and founder of the realistic school
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Vaibhashika[95]; Dharma-pala, Vasu-mitra (or Vasu-bandhu),
A?va-ghosha, Gu?amati, Sthiramati, and others. In this practice of
deifying their saints, Buddhists merely followed the example of the
adherents of Hinduism. And we may add that this tendency is constantly
repeating itself in the religious history of all nations.

There is even a tendency to press the saints of other countries into the
service. This is remarkably exemplified in the history of Barlaam and
Josaphat, current in Europe in the Middle Ages. The zealous Roman
Catholics of those <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">days</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> that they could not exclude so noble a
monk as <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> from the catalogue of their own saints, and so they
registered him in their list as St. Josaphat (Josaphat being a
corruption of Bodhisat). Colonel Yule, in his Marco Polo, states that a
church in Palermo is dedicated to this saint.

And here mention may be made of a modern deified Hindu teacher or sage,
named Gorakh-nath, who is said to have gone from India into Nepal, and
is worshipped there as <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as at Gorakh-pur and throughout the Panjab.
Very little is known about him, and he belongs more to Hinduism than to
Buddhism. Some say that he was a contemporary of Kabir (1488-1512), and,
according to a Janamsakhi, he once had an interview with Nanak, the
founder of the Sikh sect. Such legendary accounts as are current are
wrapped in much mystery. One legend describes him as <span class="t9 t24 hoverable">born</span> from a lotus.

Others describe him as the <span class="t26 hoverable">third</span> or fourth in a series of ?aiva
teachers, and the founder of the Kanpha?a sect of Yogis. The remarkable
<span class="t3 t5 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">thing</span> about him is that he succeeded in achieving an extraordinary
degree of popularity among Northern Hindus and among some adherents of
Buddhism in Nepal. His tomb is in the Panjab, and he is to this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span>
adored as a <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">god</span> by immense numbers of the inhabitants of North
Western India under the hills.

But the canonization of such historical teachers in India and their
elevation to semi-divine rank did not satisfy the craving of the
uneducated masses, either among Buddhists or Hindus, for personal
deities, possessed of powers over <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> affairs far greater than any
departed <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> beings, however eminent. In Buddhism the supposed
existence of the more god-like Bodhi-sattva Maitreya—venerated by both
the Maha-yana and the Hina-yana schools—was not sufficient to satisfy
this craving.

Hence the ‘Great Vehicle’ soon began to teach the existence of numerous
mythological Bodhi-sattvas, other than Maitreya, to whom no historical
character belonged, but <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> functions were more divine.




                              LECTURE IX.
                 _Theistic and Polytheistic Buddhism._


In the preceding Lecture I have endeavoured to sketch the rise of
theistic and polytheistic Buddhism.

We have now to turn our attention to its development, especially in
regard to the <span class="t0 t5 t11 hoverable">worship</span> of mythical Bodhi-sattvas, and of the Hindu <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span>
and other mythological beings.

Some of the Bodhi-sattvas of the Maha-yana or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Great</span> System were merely
quasi-deifications of eminent saints and teachers. Others were
impersonations of certain qualities or forces; and just as in early
Buddhism we have the simple triad of the Buddha, his Law, and his Order,
so in Northern Buddhism the <span class="t0 t5 t11 hoverable">worship</span> of mythical Bodhi-sattvas—other than
Maitreya—was originally confined to a triad, namely (1) Mañju-?ri, ‘he
of beautiful glory;’ (2) Avalokite?vara, ‘the looking-down lord,’ often
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Padma-pa?i, ‘the lotus-handed;’ (3) Vajra-pa?i or Vajra-dhara,
‘the thunderbolt-handed.’

These <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> mythical Bodhi-sattvas were not known to early Buddhists,
nor to the Buddhists of Ceylon. They are not even found in the oldest
books of the Northern School (such as the Lalita-vistara), <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> they
occur conspicuously in the Saddharma-pu??arika.

All we can say with certainty is, that when Fa-hien visited Mathura on
the Jumna 400 <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> after Christ, their cult certainly existed there at
that time.

We shall not be far wrong if we assert that it was adopted in about the
<span class="t26 hoverable">third</span> century of our era.

As already indicated (see p. 175), the <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> of the first Buddhist
triad—the Buddha, the Law, and the Monastic Order—accepted by the
adherents of both Vehicles—was probably derived from the earliest
Brahmanical triad. (See also Brahmanism and Hinduism, pp. 9, 44. 74.)

In the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t13 t14 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">second</span> Buddhist triad introduced by the advanced
teachers of the ‘Great Vehicle,’ viz. Mañju-?ri, Avalokite?vara (=
Padma-pa?i), and Vajra-pa?i, corresponded to the later Hindu triad
(tri-murti) of deities, Brahma, Vish?u, and ?iva.

I have explained in ‘Brahmanism and Hinduism’ (pp. 54, 73) how the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span>
Vish?u and ?iva gradually usurped the position of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">god</span> Brahma, whom
they dispossessed of his co-equality with themselves, and how the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span>
mythology of the Hindus, which was originally complicated by a large
admixture of pre-Aryan and Vedic elements, ultimately became more
simplified by arranging itself under the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> heads of Vaish?avism and
?aivism, all other mythological personages being regarded as forms of
either Vish?u or ?iva.

In contradistinction to this, we <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> that each member of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span>
Buddhist triads holds its own, and we are led on to a system which
bewilders us by ever increasing complications—a system which preserves
the individuality of its own triads and deified saints, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span>
recognizes almost all the gods, demigods, demons, and supernatural
<span class="t0 t1 t15 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> of Hinduism.

I propose now to offer some <span class="t1 t11 t12 t13 t16 t18 t21 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the development of the Buddhist
Pantheon, beginning with the mythical conceptions peculiar to Buddhism,
and passing on to those held in common with Hinduism.

And first as to the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t13 t14 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">second</span> Buddhist triad above-named, it may be noted,
as a proof of the very gradual growth of Buddhistic mythology, that in
the earlier developments of Buddhism the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> Bodhi-sattvas
constituting that triad have very restricted functions.

When I visited the Buddhist caves at Ellora, I noticed that in the
<span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> sculptures there, Padma-pa?i and Vajra-pa?i (but not Mañju-?ri)
are represented as attendants of the <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> Buddha.

Of course it is easy to understand that the duty of guarding the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span>
ultimately expanded into that of watching over and protecting the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span>
Buddhist world, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> it is difficult to determine which of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span>
mythical Bodhi-sattvas became first celebrated for the effective
discharge of this duty, or to which of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> chronological
precedence ought to be assigned.

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Without</span> taking the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">order</span> already given, we may begin with Padma-pa?i as
the most popular, and may <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">note</span> that he has a name, Avalokite?vara,
composed of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> Sansk?it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> avalokita, ‘looking down[96],’ and
I?vara, ‘lord,’ the latter being the Brahmanical name for the Supreme
God—a name wholly unrecognized by early Buddhism, but assigned by the
Hindus to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> personal gods, Brahma, Vish?u, and ?iva, especially
to the latter.

In the duty of watching over and protecting the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> Buddhist world,
Avalokite?vara (= Padma-pa?i), that is, ‘the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">lord</span> who looks down with
pity on all men,’ certainly takes the lead, and his name was in keeping
with the reputation for answering prayer which he soon achieved.

In the Lamism of Tibet, he is, as we shall see hereafter, a <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of
<span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> Pope, existing eternally in the heavens as Vicar of one of the
Buddhas of the present age, but delegating his functions to a succession
of earthly Popes in whom he is perpetually incarnated and re-incarnated,
while at the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> preserving his own personality in his own heaven.

Indeed, the popularity of his <span class="t0 t5 t11 hoverable">worship</span> is one of the chief
characteristics of the Maha-yana system, and is not confined to Tibet,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> he is believed to be the special patron of that country. It is he
who during the continuance of the present age of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> presides over
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> cycle of soul-migration. In a word, the temporal welfare of
all living beings, and of all who have to wander through the worlds of
the gods, men, demons, ghosts, animals, and livers in hell, is
especially assigned to him.

People, therefore, pray to him more frequently than to any other
Bodhi-sattva, and not only for release from the misery of future
re-births, but in all cases of present bodily danger and domestic
affliction. Hence he has numerous other names or epithets, such as ‘God
of mercy,’ ‘Ocean of pity’ (Karu?ar?ava), ‘Deliverer from fear’
(Abhaya?-da), ‘Lord of the world’ (Loke?-vara), ‘World-protector’
(Loka-pala), ‘Protector of the Aryas’ (Arya-pala); and the Chinese
traveller Fa-hien says of himself, that he prayed in his <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">heart</span> for the

That his <span class="t0 t5 t11 hoverable">worship</span> was very prevalent among Buddhists of the Maha-yana
School all over India, as <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as in Tibet, from the fourth to the
seventh century, is attested also by Hiouen Thsang. Both travellers tell
us that they frequently met with his images, which were often placed on
the tops of mountains. Possibly this <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> may <span class="t1 t11 t12 t13 t16 t18 t21 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> for the name he
acquired of the ‘Looking-down lord.’ Or, on the other hand, it is
possible that his name may have led to the selection of <span class="t17 t29 hoverable">high</span> situations
for his temples and images.

And it may be observed here that although Avalokite?vara bears a close
resemblance in character to Vish?u, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> his images often conform to the
Brahma type, and sometimes to that of ?iva[97]. He has generally several
faces—sometimes even eleven or twelve—and usually four or eight arms.
These faces are placed one above the other in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of a pyramid, in
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> tiers, and probably indicate that he looks down on all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span>
worlds, namely, the worlds of desire, of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> form, and of no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> (pp.
213, 214), from all points of the horizon.

Note, however, that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> of his <span class="t20 hoverable">hands</span> are generally folded, as if adoring
the Buddha, while his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> other <span class="t20 hoverable">hands</span> hold such emblems as the lotus and
wheel (especially the lotus). This distinguishes the images of the mere
Bodhi-sattva Avalokite?vara from those of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">god</span> Vish?u, who, although
he has four arms, is never represented in an attitude of adoration.
Note, too, that the many-headed images of Avalokite?vara probably belong
to the later phase of the Maha-yana, when he was regarded as an
emanation or <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> of the Dhyani-Buddha Amitabha, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> <span class="t1 t4 t9 t16 hoverable">head</span>
forms the eleventh above his own ten. There are descriptions of earlier
idols, which make it probable that Avalokite?vara was originally
represented in ordinary <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> shape.

When his <span class="t0 t5 t11 hoverable">worship</span> was introduced into China the name he received was
Kwan-she-yin or Kwan-yin (in Japan Kwan-non)—a name denoting (according
to Professor Legge) ‘one who looks down on the sounds of the world, and
listens to the voices of men.’

We know that each of the chief Hindu <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> had his female counterpart or
?akti, who is often more worshipped than the male. Similarly the female
counterpart of the male Avalokite?vara is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">god</span> chiefly
worshipped in China and Japan[98]. In those countries he is only known
in the feminine character of ‘goddess of mercy,’ and in this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> is
represented with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> arms, but oftener with four or more, and even with
a <span class="t6 hoverable">thousand</span> eyes.

The connexion of Avalokite?vara with ?iva, as <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as with Vish?u, is
proved by the <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> that in some characteristics Kwan-yin corresponds to
the Durga <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of ?iva’s wife, and in others to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Parvati,
who, as dwelling on mountains, may be supposed to look down with
compassion on the world.

As to Vajra-pa?i (or Vajra-dhara), ‘the thunderbolt-handed,’ this
Bodhi-sattva corresponds in some respects to Indra. He is the fiercest
and most awe-inspiring of all the Bodhi-sattvas, and was, in time,
converted into a <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of Buddhistic <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of ?iva, resembling that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">god</span> in
his character of controller of the demon-host and destroyer of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span>
spirits. Hiouen Thsang describes how eight Vajra-pa?is surrounded the
<span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> as an escort, when he journeyed to visit his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">father</span> ?uddhodana.
Vajra-pa?i is of course a popular <span class="t24 t25 hoverable">object</span> of veneration in all Northern
Buddhist countries, where a dread of malignant spirits is so prevalent
that the waving to and fro of an implement symbolizing a thunderbolt
(Vajra, or in Tibetan Dorje) is practised as a method of keeping them at
bay and averting their malice.

Nevertheless, Vajra-pa?i is not so popular as the <span class="t26 hoverable">third</span> Bodhi-sattva,
Mañju-?ri, ‘he of glorious beauty,’ also <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Mañju-ghosha, ‘having a
beautiful voice,’ and Vagi?vara, ‘lord of speech.’ This Bodhi-sattva, as
‘wisdom personified,’ and as ‘lord of harmony,’ may be regarded as a
counterpart of the Brahmanical Brahma or Vi?va-Karman, the supposed
creator of the universe. Brahma, however, in his character of chief god,
needed no Buddhistic substitute, having been incorporated by name into
Buddhism. Mañju-?ri, as ‘lord of speech,’ seems also to be a counterpart
of Brahma’s consort Sarasvati.

According to some, a learned and eloquent <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> teacher, named
Mañju-?ri, introduced Buddhism from India into Nepal about 250 <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span>
after the Nirva?a of Buddha, and the mythical Mañju-?ri may have been a
development of the historical personage. His <span class="t0 t5 t11 hoverable">worship</span> is mentioned by
both Fa-hien and Hiouen Thsang[99], and seems to have been very popular.

A personification of Prajña paramita, ‘transcendent wisdom,’ is also
named. And indeed it seems natural that so soon as the Buddhists began
to personify qualities and invest them with <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> attributes, learning
should have been among the first selected for deification, as it was by
the Hindus in early times.

Mark, however, that the popular Mañju-?ri has no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> assigned to him
in the Dhyani-Buddha theory.

This mystical theory was a later development. It may be explained
thus:—The term Dhyana (Jhana) is a general expression for the four
gradations of mystic meditation which have ethereal spaces or worlds
corresponding to them (p. 209), and a Dhyani-Buddha is a <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> who is
supposed to exist as a <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> essence in these <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> regions
of abstract thought.

That is to say, every <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> who appears on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> in a temporary <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span>
body—with the <span class="t24 t25 hoverable">object</span> of teaching <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> how to gain Nirva?a—exists also in
an ideal counterpart, or ethereal representation of himself, in the
formless worlds of meditation (p. 213). These ideal Buddhas are as
numerous as the Buddhas, but as there are only five chief <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> Buddhas
in the present age—Kraku-cchanda, Kanaka-muni, Ka?yapa, Gautama, and the
future <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> Maitreya—so there are only five corresponding
Dhyani-Buddhas:—Vairocana, Akshobhya, Ratna-sambhava, Amitabha, and
Amogha-siddha (sometimes represented in images as possessing a <span class="t26 hoverable">third</span>
eye). But this is not all; each of these produces by a process of
evolution a <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of emanation from himself <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> a Dhyani-Bodhi-sattva,
to act as the practical <span class="t1 t4 t9 t16 hoverable">head</span> and guardian of the Buddhist community
between the interval of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> of each <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> and the advent of
his successor. Hence there are five Bodhi-sattvas—Samanta-bhadra,
Vajra-pa?i, Ratna-pa?i, Padma-pa?i (= Avalokite?vara), and
Vi?va-pa?i—corresponding to the five Dhyani-Buddhas and to the five
earthly Buddhas respectively. In Nepal five corresponding female ?aktis
or Tara-devis are named (see p. 216).

It is remarkable that the Chinese pilgrims from the fifth to the seventh
centuries, while often mentioning the Bodhi-sattvas, make no allusion to
any of the Dhyani-Buddhas—whence we may gather that Amitabha, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span>
adopted into Indian Buddhism, was not actually worshipped in India at
least as a personal god.

In point of fact, it was only the Buddhism of the North which was not
satisfied with the original triad of the Buddha, the Law, and the
Monkhood. It, therefore, invented in addition five triads, each
consisting of a Dhyani-Buddha, a Dhyani-Bodhi-sattva, and an earthly
Buddha, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> of these triads only one was of importance, namely, that
consisting of Amitabha, Avalokite?vara, and the <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> Buddha, Gautama.
But the Lalita-vistara does not mention this theory.

It should be observed, too, that an important addition to the Maha-yana
doctrine was made in certain Northern countries about the tenth century
of our era.

A particular sect of Buddhists in Nepal, calling themselves Ai?varikas,
propounded a theory of a Supreme Being (I?vara), to whom they gave the
name of a ‘primordial Buddha’ (Adi-Buddha), and who was declared to be
the source and originator of all things, and the original Evolver of the
Dhyani-Buddhas, or Buddhas of contemplation, while they again were
supposed to evolve their corresponding Dhyani-Bodhi-sattvas.

It is clear, of course, that this addition was a mere adaptation of
Buddhism to Brahmanism, and that the Adi-Buddha was invented to serve as
a counterpart of the One Universal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Spirit</span> Brahma—the one eternally
existing <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> Essence, from which all existing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> are mere
emanations.

Sometimes, however, this Adi-Buddha is said to have produced all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span>
through union with Prajña (mentioned before, p. 202), in which <span class="t5 t16 t21 t24 t25 hoverable">case</span> he
is rather to be identified with the personal Creator Brahma.

Observe, moreover, that even in early times one of the
Dhyani-Buddhas—the one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Amitabha, ‘diffusing infinite light,’—lost
his purely abstract character, and was worshipped by Northern Buddhists
as a personal God. He is in the present <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> held by them to be an
<span class="t0 t28 hoverable">eternal</span> Being, the ideal of all that is beautiful and good, who receives
his worshippers into a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heaven</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Sukhavati, ‘paradise of pleasures’
(see p. 183).

But it must also be noted that neither Adi-Buddha nor Amitabha, when
regarded as personal gods, were held to be Creators of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">World</span> in the
Christian sense. They were merely Supreme rulers outside and above it;
for Northern Buddhists agree with Southern in thinking that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span>
exists of itself, and that its only Creator is the force of its own
acts.

We <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t11 t12 t19 t22 hoverable">pass</span> on now to consider how far and with what modifications the
mythology of Brahmanism and Hinduism was incorporated into Buddhism.

I have already pointed out that although the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> changed the
character of much of the existing mythology, he never prohibited his
lay-followers from continuing their old forms of worship, or bowing down
before the deities honoured by their <span class="t3 hoverable">fathers</span> and grandfathers.

Apart indeed from the shrewd policy of not assuming an attitude of
hostility to popular creeds and usages, the tolerant tendency and
universality of the Buddha’s teaching obliged him, in common
consistency, to recognize, and as far as possible appropriate, the
various religious elements existing around him, and to subordinate them
to his own purposes.

In fact, according to the theory of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> Buddhism, as has been <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span>
pointed out by other writers, there was only one system of doctrine and
only one Law—that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Law</span> (Dharma) which Gautama <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> came to renovate for
the benefit of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> in the present age.

Hence all the apparently conflicting creeds, dogmas, forms, ceremonies,
and usages of all nations, tribes, and races, were in reality mere
outcomes, or dim recollections, or corruptions, of that one and the same
universal Dharma which countless Buddhas had preached to mankind, in
countless ages before the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of Gautama, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> continue to preach
in ages to come.

Hinduism, therefore, like all other creeds, was contained in the Dharma
of Buddhism, and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> <span class="t24 t25 hoverable">object</span> of Gautama’s advent was not to uproot
the old religion, but to purify it from error and restore it.

It was on this <span class="t1 t11 t12 t13 t16 t18 t21 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> that he regarded the Hindu <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> as occupying a

And here it will be necessary to give an <span class="t1 t11 t12 t13 t16 t18 t21 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the later Buddhist
theory of twenty-six successive tiers of heavens, one rising above the
other (p. 120).

In the centre of the world-system stands, as we have seen, the vast mass
of the mythical mountain Meru. On the upper portion of this stupendous
axis of the universe and above the eight chief hells and the worlds of
animals, ghosts, demons, and men, is situated the lowest <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heaven</span> of the
gods, where abide the four Maha-rajas, ‘great champions,’ or guardians
of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> and the heavens against the demons, who are ever engaged in
assailing them from their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> below. These four are represented in
<span class="t10 t16 hoverable">full</span> armour, with drawn swords; one quarter of the heavens being
assigned to the guardianship of each; viz. the East to Dh?ita-rash?ra,

popular among Buddhists or oftener named in their legends; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> he is
inferior to Maha-brahma and to Mara (p. 208). <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> himself was Indra

Hence we may infer that in the early <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">days</span> of Buddhism, Indra, who was

The remaining heavens of the gods, which rise in succession above the

Bodhi-sattvas destined to become Buddhas. Gautama <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> once dwelt
there, and Maitreya now presides in it.

The fifth <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heaven</span> is inhabited by the Nirma?a-rati-deva?, that is,
‘beings who constantly enjoy pleasures provided by themselves.’

The sixth heaven, and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t22 t23 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">highest</span> of the Deva-lokas, is the abode of the

are ‘lords of sensuous desires.’ When the theory of races of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> was
invented, it led to the figment of millions of Maras ruled over by a
chief Mara, who tempts <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> to indulge their passions (pp. 28, 33, 41),

of eye, ear, etc. (see note, p. 129). One of Mara’s names is Kama,
‘desire.’ He is superior to all the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> of the worlds of sense, even to
?akra or Indra. In every Cakravala or Universe of worlds there is a
Mara. He is sometimes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the Buddhist Satan, but this is misleading.
He is rather a superior god, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> consists in exciting sensual or
carnal desires.

So far, then, the heavens are all worlds of sense,—like the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> and
the lower regions,—and are spheres inhabited by <span class="t0 t1 t15 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> who have sexual
feelings and live active lives. But at this point in the ascent upwards
all sensuality ceases, and we are introduced to <span class="t0 t1 t15 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> who enjoy a
<span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> condition of existence in which there is no distinction of sex,
and all sensuous desires and objects have lost their hold over the
frame—a condition supposed to be induced by the exercise of mystical
abstract meditation (Dhyana, Pali Jhana).

The importance of Dhyana or intense abstract meditation in the Buddhist
system has been pointed out before (p. 32). It is the chief religious
exercise in which a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> follower of <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> can engage, and although it
is divided into four stages, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> who exercises himself perfectly in
any one of the four, becomes so sublimated and refined that he cannot be
re-born in any of the sensuous heavens, or in any region lower than the
Brahma worlds.

The first stage of Dhyana consists in fixing (Dhara?a) the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> and at
the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> exercising the thinking faculties on some object, in such
a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> that a <span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> of ecstatic joy and serenity is attained.

The <span class="t0 t2 t5 t13 t14 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">second</span> consists in concentrating the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> so intensely on
itself that the thinking faculties cease to act and only ecstatic joy
and serenity remain.

In the third, nothing remains but perfect serenity.

The fourth is a trance-like condition of utter indifference and torpor,
in which there is neither any exercise of thought, nor any conscious joy

and soars to a transcendental condition, characterized by latent energy
and a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of working miracles (p. 133).

These four stages of abstract meditation must not be confused with the
four earnest reflections and the five contemplations (pp. 49, 127),
which are not so abstract and require more earthly objects on which to
be exercised.

The fourth and last Dhyana is also <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Samadhi, and properly means
such a perfect concentration of the soul’s faculties, that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span>
becomes merged in itself. It is often <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">used</span> to denote an ecstatic
condition, scarcely to be distinguished from trance or hypnotism or
catalepsy. Those devotees in India who practise it are buried, not
burnt, and their tombs are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Samadhs.

To return now to Buddhist Cosmology, the theory of later Buddhism is
that he who has practised the first Dhyana will rise at <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> to one of

first and lowest of the four groups of worlds of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> (rupa), in
which all sexual distinctions are obliterated.

This first or lowest group consists of the worlds of the Brahmas, a <span class="t17 t29 hoverable">high</span>

The first class of Brahma gods, inhabiting the first or lowest of the
tiers of the Brahma abodes, consists of the Brahma-parisajja deva?, or
<span class="t0 t1 t15 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> who constitute the retinue of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">god</span> Maha-brahma—the chief of
all the Buddhist gods.

The <span class="t0 t2 t5 t13 t14 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">second</span> class of Brahma gods, inhabiting the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t13 t14 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">second</span> tier, consists of
the Brahma-purohita deva?, ‘beings who are the ministers of
Maha-brahma.’

The <span class="t26 hoverable">third</span> class of Brahma gods, inhabiting the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t22 t23 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">highest</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span>
tiers, consists of the Maha-brahmas, ‘great Brahmas,’ of whom
Maha-brahma is the chief.

The inhabitants of these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> worlds are sometimes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the
Brahma-kayika deva?, ‘gods having a Brahma form.’

It is important, however, to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">note</span> that Brahma or Maha-brahma, sometimes

Indra do in the lower worlds and heavens of <span class="t0 t1 t7 t12 t13 t14 t17 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">sense</span> and desire. Out of
deference to Brahmanism he has been adopted as the chief <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">god</span> of the

Furthermore, it is to be observed that every Cakra-vala or ‘system of
worlds’ (see p. 120) has its own Maha-brahma ruling over its own <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span>
heavens, and that as there are countless Cakra-vala, so there are
countless Maha-brahmas. Nor is any of these chief <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> eternal. Each has

time, and is then succeeded by another. Gautama <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> himself was <span class="t9 t24 hoverable">born</span>
four times as Maha-brahma (see p. 111).

The characteristic of these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> heavens is that they are regions of

In the first are the Parittabha (Parittabha) deva?, ‘beings of
circumscribed or limited enlightenment;’ in the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t13 t14 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">second</span> are the
Aprama?abha (Appama?abha) deva?, ‘beings of infinite light;’ in the
<span class="t26 hoverable">third</span> are the Abhasvara (Abhassara) deva?, ‘beings of the clearest
light.’

The <span class="t26 hoverable">third</span> group of worlds of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> has again <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> tiers of heavens,
which are assigned to those who have raised themselves to the <span class="t26 hoverable">third</span>
stage of contemplation.

The peculiarity of these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> seems to be that they are regions of the
greatest purity, and that each of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> is the abode of <span class="t0 t1 t15 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span>
distinguished by <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> degrees of purity. In the first are
the Paritta-?ubha (Paritta-subha) deva?, ‘gods or <span class="t0 t1 t15 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> of limited
purity;’ in the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t13 t14 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">second</span> are the Aprama?a-?ubha (Appamana-subha) deva?,
‘beings of unlimited purity;’ in the <span class="t26 hoverable">third</span> are the ?ubha-k?itsna
(Subha-ki??a) deva?, ‘beings of absolute purity.’

The fourth group of worlds of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> has seven tiers of heavens,
occupied by those <span class="t0 t1 t15 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> who have risen to the fourth or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t22 t23 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">highest</span> grade
of abstract meditation (Dhyana), which is really a <span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> of meditating
on nothing and of complete indifference to all concrete objects. These
<span class="t0 t1 t15 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> are the emancipated Arhats who have delivered themselves from the
cycle (Sa?sara) of constant re-birth (p. 134).

In the first tier are the V?ihat-phala (Vehapphala) deva?, ‘beings
enjoying <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> reward;’ in the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t13 t14 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">second</span> are the Asañjñi-sattva
(Asañña-satta) deva?, ‘beings lost in total unconsciousness;’ in the
<span class="t26 hoverable">third</span> are the Av?iha (Aviha) deva?, ‘beings who make no efforts;’ in the
fourth are the Atapa (Atappa) deva?, ‘beings who never endure any pain;’
in the fifth are the Sudar?a (Sudassa) deva?, ‘beings who see clearly;’
in the sixth are the Sudar?ino (Sudassi) deva?, ‘beings of beautiful
appearance;’ in the seventh are the Akanish?ha (Akani??ha) deva?,
‘highest of all beings.’ In this last must be included all Arhats and
Pratyeka-Buddhas.

<span class="t17 t29 hoverable">High</span> above the worlds of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> and above the abode of pure
contemplative beings, rise the four heavens of formless entities—beings
who have no material frames, even of the subtlest kind, but are mere
abstractions, such as the Dhyani-Buddhas (pp. 202, 203).

In the first of these formless heavens (Arupa-loka) are the
Aka?anantyayatana deva?, ‘beings who are capable of conceiving the <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span>
of infinite space;’ in the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t13 t14 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">second</span> are the Vijñananantyayatana deva?,
‘beings who are capable of conceiving the <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> of infinite
intelligence;’ in the <span class="t26 hoverable">third</span> are the Akiñcanyayatana deva?, ‘beings who
can conceive the <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> of absolute nonentity,’ or, in other words, that
nothing whatever exists anywhere; in the fourth and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t22 t23 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">highest</span> of all are
the Naivasañjñanasañjñayatana deva? (Nevasaññanasaññayå-), ‘beings who
abide in neither <span class="t0 t1 t13 t16 t24 t25 hoverable">consciousness</span> nor unconsciousness.’ This is the most
sublime of all conditions, but these heavens belong to mystical
Buddhism.

Subjoined is a synopsis of all the heavens and their inhabitants
explained above (see Koeppen i. 260).

The description, however, belongs to later Buddhism. It enables us to

constitute one of the six classes of beings, and, as they have to go
through other forms of life, are inferior to Arhats and Buddhas.

Maha-brahma is often named, whereas Vish?u, the popular <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">god</span> of the

Buddhist countries.

When I was at Kandy in Ceylon I found one solitary shrine (Devali)
dedicated, not to K?ish?a, but to Maha-Vish?u. It was near the
well-known Tooth-temple and appeared almost deserted. The shrine was at
the end of a bare room, and contained a small silver-gilt image of
Maha-Vish?u (as Vish?u is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> when worshipped by Buddhists, just as

high. In the <span class="t20 hoverable">hands</span> of the image was a thin metal bar with a <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of
locket or amulet suspended from it, while round its neck was a <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span>

Buddhism in his character of Yogi, or Maha-yogi (see ‘Brahmanism and
Hinduism,’ p. 83). Then, as the Buddhism of the North very soon became
corrupted with ?aivism and its accompaniments, ?aktism, Tantrism, and
Magic, so in Northern countries various forms of ?iva—such as Maha-Kala,
Bhairava, Bhima—and of his wife (Parvati, Durga, etc.), are honoured,
and their images are found in temples. Sometimes bloody sacrifices are
offered to them.

Among the female deities forms of Tara are chiefly worshipped, and
regarded as ?aktis of the Buddhas.

It is even held by the disciples of the more advanced
Maha-yana—especially in Nepal—that there are five ?aktis or female
Energies (corresponding to the five <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> Buddhas), <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> names are

Pa??ara, and Tara or Tara-devi (the latter being the Tara _par

But the goddess Tara was also worshipped by Buddhists in India proper;
for we <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> that Hiouen Thsang alludes to having seen images of Tara
Bodhi-sattva[102] in the country of Magadha.

I may mention, too, that in a dilapidated building, which contains the
Vajrasana or thunderbolt throne of Gautama at Buddha-Gaya (in the same
country of Magadha), I noticed in a shrine near the temple, an image of
Tara-devi, which, from the crown of fresh flowers encircling its head,
appeared to have been recently worshipped by some Buddhist pilgrims, who
had arrived on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> of my visit in 1876.

In Ceylon I observed several shrines to Kanda-Kumara, a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of Skanda
(son of ?iva), who is said to have received the gift of healing from
Buddha.

There also I observed shrines of Saman (sometimes spelt Samanta,
sometimes Sumana), the tutelary deity of Adam’s Peak, which is thence

Then there were shrines dedicated to a demoniacal goddess <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Pa??ini

No doubt the <span class="t0 t5 t11 hoverable">worship</span> of devils and demons existed in Ceylon <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> before

Their dance was of the wildest description, in a circle, sometimes
moving in and out, and crossing each other, and all the while beating

There were also <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> dressed
in reddish garments, who formed part of the group and moved about
quietly among the others. They were described to me as devil-charmers or
exorcisers.

Every disease—every calamity has its presiding demon, and all such
demons are the servants of Buddha.

In regard to the other supernatural <span class="t0 t1 t15 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> and figments of Hindu
mythology adopted, with a few unimportant modifications, by Buddhists,
the first that <span class="t8 t13 t21 hoverable">call</span> for mention are the Pretas (see p. 121).

The Pretas are <span class="t0 t1 t15 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of ghosts and goblins who have
recently inhabited the earth, and are often of gigantic size and
terrific appearance, with dried-up limbs, hairy countenances, enormous
bellies, ever consumed with hunger and thirst, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> never able to <span class="t6 hoverable">eat</span>
and drink by <span class="t1 t11 t16 t20 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">reason</span> of their contracted throats. Some are represented as
trying to swallow sparks of fire; others try to <span class="t6 hoverable">eat</span> up dead bodies, or
their own flesh. Possibly this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of re-birth was invented to deter
the laity from withholding <span class="t0 t14 t23 t24 hoverable">food</span> from the monks. The Pretas inhabit a
region above the hells. Some, however, assign them habitations above the
surface of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> or in desert places on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> itself.

The Asuras or Daityas are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> demons who, like the Titans of Greek
mythology, are always at war with the gods. They dwell under the
foundations of Mount Meru, as far underneath the surface of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> as
their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> enemy Indra is above it. In short, if he may be supposed to
live at the zenith, they live at the nadir, and their battle-field is on
the slopes of Meru.

Closely connected with them are the Rakshasas, who are also enemies of
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> and are represented as monsters of frightful <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> and
man-eating propensities. They haunt cremation-grounds and cemeteries and
way-lay <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t0 t1 t15 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> in solitary places to devour them.

Then there is a class of very malignant demons <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Pi?acas (described
in ‘Brahmanism and Hinduism,’ p. 242), who are the authors of all evils.

On the other hand, the Yakshas and Yakshi?is are a class of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> genii
ruled over by Kuvera, ‘god of wealth,’ who is often referred to in
Buddhist writings under his patronymic Vai?rava?a (Pali Vessava?o)[103].
These <span class="t0 t1 t15 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> are commonly represented in sculptures in <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> and
held to be harmless, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> some Buddhist legends describe them as
cruel. Stories are told about some of them being converted to Buddhism.

Then come the Nagas, who are constantly alluded to. They properly belong
to a class of serpent-demons, having <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> faces with serpent-like lower
extremities, who live in one of the lower regions below the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span>
Patala, or under the waters. They are introduced into Buddhist
sculptures as worshippers of the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> and friends of all Buddhists,
but usually represented as ordinary men. The Naga Mucalinda (also
Mucilinda), who sheltered Buddha, was a real serpent (see p. 39).
Naga-kanyas or female Nagas (serpents from the waist downwards) are also
not uncommon[104]. In Kashmir Nagas are connected with fountains and the
sources of rivers.

Then there are the Mahoragas, ‘great dragons,’ who also belong to the
Naga class of demons.

We ought also to notice the Kumbha??as, a class of demons who attend on
Viru?haka (p. 206); the Garu?as, a bird-like race ruled over by the
mythical Garu?a, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> of birds and enemy of the Nagas and serpents; the
Apsarases, or nymphs produced at the churning of the ocean. These last
are sometimes described in Hindu mythology as the Huris of Indra’s
heaven, who are assigned to heroes killed in battle. In Buddhist
sculptures they are represented as beautiful females, who are properly
the wives of Indra’s celestial musicians <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Gandharvas.

Finally, mention should be made of the Kinnaras and Kinnaris—beings who
ought properly to be represented with <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> bodies and equine heads, and
are, like the Gandharvas, heavenly musicians. It is even recorded in one
legend that the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> himself in a former <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> was a Kinnari.

All this proves the close connexion of Buddhism with the Hinduism which,
like Buddhism, grew out of Brahmanism. In short, the one mythology is so
interpenetrated with the other, that Buddhism in making proselytes
throughout Eastern Asia could not avoid propagating Hindu mythological
doctrines along with its own.

The consequence was that Hinduism, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> often regarded as an
unproselyting and wholly national religion, really exercised a vast
influence outside its own boundaries and among alien races.

It is, at any rate, a remarkable <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> that no mythological system has
ever spread over so large an area of the earth’s surface as that which,
originating in India, was accepted to a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> extent by all Buddhist
communities. And this Indo-Buddhistic system of mythology, with its, to
us, absurd idolatry, rests on an extremely subtle <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of pantheism,
which is not to be brushed aside as too contemptible for investigation.

It is usual to denounce all such systems as simple Heathenism; but
‘Heathenism’ means the religion of ‘the nations’—the religion evolved by
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> of all countries out of their own imaginations and by their own
natural faculties, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> the aid of any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> supernatural revelation.

And assuredly this religion of <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> is still a strong citadel
entrenched behind the formidable forces of pride, passion, prejudice,
and ignorance. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> the walls of the fortress have numerous weak places,
which the <span class="t5 t8 hoverable">wise</span> missionary, armed with the still more powerful forces at
his command, will endeavour to discover and quietly undermine. By
patient and quiet working he must win the day.

With man, speed and rapidity of action are supposed to be the chief
evidences of progress and the chief factors in success. The Evangelist,
on the other hand, is a worker for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> and a fellow-worker with God, and
ought not to be discouraged by the tardy advance of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Truth</span> which he
advocates. He may have his moments of despondency, but he has only to
look around and observe that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t7 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">works</span> everywhere throughout His own
Universe by slow and almost imperceptible processes. The ripe fruit
falls from the tree in a second, but its maturity is not effected
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> year of gradual preparation.




                               LECTURE X.
     _Mystical Buddhism in its connexion with the Yoga philosophy._


The first <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> implied by Buddhism is intellectual enlightenment. But
Buddhism has its own theory of enlightenment—its own <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span>
knowledge, which it calls Bodhi, not Veda. By <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> it means
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> acquired by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> through his own intellectual faculties and
through his own inner consciousness, instincts, and intuitions, unaided
by any external or supernatural revelation of any kind.

But it is important to observe that Buddhism, in the carrying out of its
own theory of entire self-dependence in the search after truth, was
compelled to be somewhat inconsistent with itself. It enjoined
self-conquest, self-restraint, self-concentration, and separation from
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> for the attainment of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> and for the
accomplishment of its own _summum bonum_—the bliss of Nirva?a—the bliss
of deliverance from the fires of passion and the flames of
concupiscence. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> it encouraged association and combination for mutual
help. It established a universal brotherhood of celibate monks, open to
persons of all castes and ranks, to rich and poor, learned and unlearned
alike—a community of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> which might, in theory, be co-extensive with
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> world—all bound <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> by the common aim of self-conquest,
all animated by the wish to aid each other in the battle with carnal
desires, all penetrated by a <span class="t0 t10 t11 t17 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">desire</span> to follow the example of the Buddha,
and be guided by the doctrine or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">law</span> which he promulgated.

Cœnobitic monasticism in fact, as we have already pointed out, became an
essential part of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> Buddhism and a necessary instrument for its
propagation.

In all this the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> showed himself to be eminently practical in his
methods and profoundly <span class="t5 t8 hoverable">wise</span> in his generation. Evidently, too, he was
<span class="t5 t8 hoverable">wise</span> in abstaining at first from all mystical teaching. Originally
Buddhism <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> its <span class="t3 hoverable">face</span> against all solitary asceticism and all secret
efforts to attain sublime heights of knowledge. It had no occult, no
esoteric system of doctrine which it withheld from ordinary men.

Nor did <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> Buddhism at first concern itself with any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of
philosophical or metaphysical teaching, which it did not consider
helpful for the attainment of the only <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> worth

suppressing self and extinguishing desires.

In the Maha-parinibbana-sutta (Rhys Davids, II. 32) is recorded one of
the Buddha’s remarks shortly before his decease:—

‘What, O Ananda, does the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Order</span> <span class="t0 t10 t11 t17 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">desire</span> of me? I have taught the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">law</span>
(desito dhammo) <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> making any distinction between esoteric and
exoteric doctrine (anantaram abahiram karitva). In the matter of the
law, the Tathagata (i.e. the Buddha) has never had the closed fist of a
teacher (acariya-mu??hi)—of a teacher who withholds some doctrines and
communicates others.’ In short, he was opposed to mysticism.

Nevertheless, admitting, as we must, that early Buddhism had no
mysteries reserved for a privileged circle, we must not shut our <span class="t2 t6 t19 t20 t26 t29 hoverable">eyes</span> to
the <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> importance attached to abstract meditation in
the Buddhist system could not fail in the end to encourage the growth of
mystical ideas.

Furthermore, it is undeniable that such ideas were, in some countries,
carried to the most extravagant extremes. Efforts to induce a
trance-like or hypnotic condition, by abstracting the thoughts from all
bodily influences, by recitation of mystical sentences, and by
superstitious devices for the acquisition of supernatural faculties,
were placed above <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t7 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">works</span> and all the duties of the moral code.

We might point, too, to the strange doctrine which arose in Nepal and
Tibet—the doctrine of the Dhyani-Buddhas (or ‘Buddhas of
Meditation’)—certain abstract Essences existing in the formless worlds
of thought, who were held to be ethereal and <span class="t0 t28 hoverable">eternal</span> representatives of
the transitory earthly Buddhas. These have been adverted to in a
previous Lecture (see p. 202).

Our present concern is rather with the growth and development of
mystical Buddhism in India itself, through its connexion with the system
of philosophy <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Yoga and Yogacara.

The close relationship of Buddhism to that system is <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> known; but the
various practices included under the name Yoga did not owe their origin
to Buddhism. They were prevalent in India before Gautama Buddha’s time;
and one of the most generally accepted facts in his biography is that,
after abandoning his home and worldly associations, he resorted to
certain <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> ascetics, who were practising Yoga.

What then was the <span class="t24 t25 hoverable">object</span> which these ascetics had in view?

The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> Yoga literally means ‘union’ (as derived from the Sansk?it root
‘yuj,’ to join; compare the English <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> ‘yoke’), and the proper aim of
every <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> who practised Yoga was the mystic union (or rather re-union)
of his own <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> with the one <span class="t0 t28 hoverable">eternal</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Soul</span> or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Spirit</span> of the Universe.

all earthly things. To him a clod, a stone, and gold should be all
alike.

Doubtless this was the Buddha’s first aim when he addressed himself to
Yoga in the fifth century B.C., and even to this hour, earnest <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> in
India resort to this system with the same object.

In the Indian Magazine for July, 1887 (as <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as in my ‘Brahmanism and
Hinduism,’ p. 529), is a short biography of a quite recent religious
reformer named Svami Dayananda-Sarasvati, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> acquaintance I made at
Bombay in 1876 and 1877, and who only died in 1883. The story of his
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> reads almost like a repetition of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of Buddha, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> his
teaching aimed at restoring the supposed monotheistic doctrine of the
Veda.

It is recorded that his father, desiring to initiate him into the
mysteries of ?aivism, <span class="t2 t4 t6 t9 t18 t19 t22 hoverable">took</span> him to a shrine dedicated to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">god</span> ?iva;
but the sight of some mice stealing the consecrated offerings, and of
some rats playing on the heads of the idol, led him to disbelieve in
?iva-worship as a means of union with the Supreme Being. Longing,
however, for such union and for emancipation from the burden of repeated
births, he resolved to renounce marriage and abandon the world.
Accordingly, at the age of twenty-two, he clandestinely quitted his
home, the darkness of evening covering his flight. Taking a secret path,
he travelled thirty miles during the night. Next <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> he was pursued by
his father, who tried to force him to return, but in vain. After
travelling farther and farther from his native province, he <span class="t2 t4 t6 t9 t18 t19 t22 hoverable">took</span> a vow
to devote himself to the investigation of truth. Then he wandered for
many <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> all over India, trying to gain <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> from sages and
philosophers, but <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> any satisfactory result, till finally he
settled at Ahmedabad. There, having mastered the <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> Yoga system, he
became the leader of a new sect <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the Arya-Samaj.

And here we may observe that the expression ‘higher Yoga’ implies that a
lower <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of that system had been introduced. In point of fact, the
Yoga system grew, and became twofold—that is, it came in the end to have
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> objects.

The earlier was the <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> Yoga. It aimed only at union with the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Spirit</span>
of the Universe. The more developed system aimed at something more. It
sought to acquire miraculous powers by bringing the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> under control
of the will, and by completely abstracting the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> and mind,
and isolating it in its own essence. This condition is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Kaivalya.

In the fifth century B.C., when Gautama <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> began his career, the
later and lower <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of Yoga seems to have been little known.
Practically, in those days, earnest and devout <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> craved only for union
with the Supreme Being, and absorption into his Essence. Many methods of
effecting such union and absorption were contrived. And these may be
classed under <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> chief heads—bodily mortification (tapas) and abstract
meditation (dhyana).

By either one of these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> chief means, the devotee was supposed to be
able to get rid of all bodily fetters—to be able to <span class="t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t27 t29 hoverable">bring</span> his bodily
organs into such subjection to the <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> that he became unconscious
of possessing any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> at all. It was in this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> that his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> became
fit for blending with the Universal Spirit, of which it was originally a
part.

We learn from the Lalita-vistara that various forms of bodily torture,
self-maceration, and austerity were common in Gautama’s time.

Some devotees, we read, seated themselves in one spot and kept perpetual
silence, with their legs bent under them. Some ate only once a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> or
once on alternate days, or at intervals of four, six, or fourteen days.
Some slept in wet clothes or on ashes, gravel, stones, boards, thorny
grass, or spikes, or with the <span class="t3 hoverable">face</span> downwards. Some <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> naked, making no
distinction between fit or unfit places. Some smeared themselves with
ashes, cinders, dust, or clay. Some inhaled smoke and fire. Some gazed
at the sun, or sat surrounded by five fires, or rested on one foot, or
kept one arm perpetually uplifted, or moved about on their knees instead
of on their feet, or baked themselves on hot stones, or submerged
themselves in water, or suspended themselves in air.

Then, again, a method of fasting <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> very painful (atik?icchra),
described by Manu (XI. 213), was often practised. It consisted in eating
only a single mouthful every <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> for nine days, and then abstaining from
all <span class="t0 t14 t23 t24 hoverable">food</span> for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> following days.

Another method, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the lunar fast (VI. 20, XI. 216), consisted in
beginning with fifteen mouthfuls at <span class="t10 t16 hoverable">full</span> moon, and reducing the quantity
by one mouthful till new moon, and then increasing it again in the same
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> till <span class="t10 t16 hoverable">full</span> moon.

Passages <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> <span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span> might be quoted from <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> literature to prove
that similar practices were resorted to throughout India, with the
<span class="t24 t25 hoverable">object</span> of bringing the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> into subjection to the spirit. And these
practices have continued up to the present day.

A Muhammadan traveller, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> narrative is quoted by Mr. Mill (British
India, i. 355), once saw a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> standing motionless with his <span class="t3 hoverable">face</span> towards
the sun.

The same traveller, having occasion to revisit the same spot sixteen
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> afterwards, found the very same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> in the very same attitude. He
had gazed on the sun’s disk till all <span class="t0 t1 t7 t12 t13 t14 t17 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">sense</span> of external vision was
extinguished.

A Yogi was seen not very <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> ago (Mill’s India, i. 353) seated between
four fires on a quadrangular stage. He stood on one leg gazing at the
sun, while these fires were lighted at the four corners. Then placing
himself upright on his head, with his feet elevated in the air, he
remained for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> hours in that position. He then seated himself
cross-legged, and continued bearing the raging heat of the <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t21 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">sun</span> above his
<span class="t1 t4 t9 t16 hoverable">head</span> and the fires which surrounded him, till the end of the day,
occasionally adding combustibles with his own <span class="t20 hoverable">hands</span> to increase the

I, myself, in the course of my travels, encountered Yogis who had kept
their arms uplifted for years, or had wandered about from one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> of
pilgrimage to another under a perpetual vow of silence, or had no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span>

As to fasting, the <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> that attenuation of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> by abstinence from

in Europe as in Asia; but the most austere observer of Lent in European

If we now turn to the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t13 t14 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">second</span> method of attaining mystic union with the
<span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Essence, namely, by profound abstract thought, we may observe
that it, too, was everywhere prevalent in Buddha’s time.

Indeed, one of the names given by Indian philosophers to the One
Universal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Spirit</span> is Cit, ‘Thought.’ By that name, of course, is meant
pure abstract thought, or the faculty of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> separated from every
concrete object. Hence, in its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t22 t23 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">highest</span> <span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> the <span class="t0 t28 hoverable">eternal</span> infinite
Spirit, by its very nature, thinks of nothing. It is the simple
thought-faculty, wholly unconnected with any <span class="t24 t25 hoverable">object</span> about which it
thinks. In point of fact, the moment it begins to exercise this faculty,
it necessarily abandons for a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> its condition of absolute oneness,
abstraction, and isolation, to associate itself with something inferior,
which is not itself.

It follows, therefore, that intense concentration of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> on the One
Universal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Spirit</span> amounts to fixing the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> on a mere abstract
Essence, which reciprocates no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> in return, and is not conscious
of being <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> about by its worshipper.

In harmony with this theory, we <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> that the definition of Yoga, in the
<span class="t0 t2 t5 t13 t14 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">second</span> aphorism of the Yoga-sutra, is, ‘the suppression (nirodha) of the
functions or modifications (v?itti) of the thinking principle (citta).’
So that, in reality, the union of the <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> with the infinite
Principle of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> amounts to such complete mental absorption, that
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> itself becomes lost in pure thought.

In the ?akuntala (VII. 175) there is a description of an ascetic engaged
in this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of Yoga, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> condition of fixed meditation and immovable
impassiveness had lasted so <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> that ants had thrown up a mound as <span class="t17 t29 hoverable">high</span>
as his waist, and birds had built their nests in the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> clotted
tresses of his tangled hair.

Not many <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> ago, I, myself, saw at Allahabad near the fort a devotee
who had maintained a sitting, contemplative posture, with his feet
folded under his body, in one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> for twenty years. During the Mutiny
cannon thundered over his head, and bullets hissed around him, but
nothing apparently disturbed his attitude of profound meditation. Even
Muhammadans practise the same. The Russian correspondent of the _Times_
states (Sept. 18, 1888) that he saw in a mosque at Samarkand <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> who
voluntarily remained mute and motionless for forty days. On a curtain
being pulled aside he beheld a motionless figure seated in profound
meditation like a squatting mummy. The guide said that a cannon fired
off in front of his <span class="t3 hoverable">face</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have <span class="t1 t7 t12 t29 hoverable">left</span> him equally unmoved.

It is clear, then, that, supposing Gautama to have made up his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> to
devote himself to a religious life, his adoption of a course of profound
meditation was a most usual proceeding.

A large <span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span> of the images of <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> represent him sitting on a raised
seat or throne (called the Bodhi-ma??a), with his legs folded under his
body, and his <span class="t2 t6 t19 t20 t26 t29 hoverable">eyes</span> half-closed, in a condition of abstraction
(samadhi)—sometimes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Yoga-nidra; that is, a trance-like state,
resembling profound sleep. (Compare frontispiece.)

He is said to have seated himself in this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> under four trees in
succession (see p. 39 of these Lectures), namely, under the Bodhi-tree
or sacred fig-tree, under the Banyan-tree, under the Mucalinda-tree
(protected by the serpent), and under the Rajayatana-tree.

And those four successive seats probably symbolized the four recognized
stages of meditation[105] (dhyana) rising one above the other, till
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> itself was converted into non-thought (see p. 209).

We know, too, that the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> through still <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> progressive
stages of meditation at the moment of his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> or final decease
(Pari-nirva?a), <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> described in the Maha-parinibbana-sutta (Davids,
VI. 11):

‘Then the Venerable One entered into the first stage of meditation
(pathamajjhanam); and rising out of the first stage, he passed into the
second; and rising out of the second, he passed into the third; and
rising out of the third, he passed into the fourth; and rising out of
the fourth stage, he attained the conception of the infinity of space
(aka?anañcayatanam, see p. 214); and rising out of the conception of the
infinity of space, he attained the conception of the infinity of
<span class="t5 t15 t21 t27 hoverable">intelligence</span> (viñña?añcayatanam); and rising out of the <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> of the
infinity of intelligence, he attained the conception of absolute
nonentity (akiñcaññayatanam); and rising out of the <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> of nonentity,
he entered the region where there is neither <span class="t0 t1 t13 t16 t24 t25 hoverable">consciousness</span> nor
unconsciousness; and rising out of that region, he entered the <span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> in
which all sensation and perception of ideas had wholly ceased.’ (See p.
213 of these Lectures.)

Clearly, even four progressive stages of abstraction did not satisfy the
requirements of later Buddhism in regard to the intense sublimation of
the thinking faculty needed for the complete effacement of all <span class="t0 t1 t7 t12 t13 t14 t17 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">sense</span> of
individuality. <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">Higher</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> altitudes had to be reached, insomuch
that the fourth stage of abstract meditation is sometimes divided and
subdivided into what are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> eight Vimokhas and eight Samapattis—all
of them forms and stages of ecstatic meditation[106].

A general name, however, for all the <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> trance-like states is
_Samadhi_, and by the practice of Samadhi the six transcendent faculties
(Abhiñña) might ultimately be obtained, viz. the inner ear, or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of
hearing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> and sounds, however distant (clair-audience, as it might
be called); the inner eye, or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of seeing all that happens in every
part of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> (clair-voyance); <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of the thoughts of others;
recollection of former existences; the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of the mode of
destroying the corrupting influences of passion; and, finally, the
supernatural powers <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Iddhi, to be subsequently explained.

But to return to the Buddha’s first course of meditation at the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span>
when he first attained Buddhahood. This happened during one particular
night, which was followed by the birthday of Buddhism.

And what was the first grand outcome of that first profound mental
abstraction? One legend relates that in the first watch of the night all
his previous existences flashed across his mind; in the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t13 t14 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">second</span> he
understood all present states of being; in the <span class="t26 hoverable">third</span> he traced out the
chain of causes and effects, and at the dawn of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> he knew all things.

According to another legend, there was an actual outburst of the <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span>
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> before hidden <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">within</span> him.

We read in the Lalita-vistara (chap. i) that at the supreme moment of
his intellectual illumination brilliant flames of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> issued from the
crown of his head, through the interstices of his cropped hair. These
rays are sometimes represented in his images, emerging from his skull in
a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> resembling the five fingers of an extended <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> (see the
frontispiece).

Mark, however, that Gautama’s meditation never led him to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t22 t23 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">highest</span>
result of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> Yoga of Indian philosophy—union with the Supreme
Spirit. On the contrary, his self-enlightenment led to entire disbelief
in the separate existence of any eternal, infinite <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Spirit</span> at all—any
Spirit, in fact, with which a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> existing in his own <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> could
blend, or into which it could be absorbed.

If the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> was not a materialist, in the <span class="t0 t1 t7 t12 t13 t14 t17 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">sense</span> of believing in the
<span class="t0 t28 hoverable">eternal</span> existence of material atoms, neither could he in any <span class="t0 t1 t7 t12 t13 t14 t17 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">sense</span> be

abstract spirit.

With him <span class="t0 t1 t5 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Creation</span> did not proceed from an Omnipotent <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Spirit</span> or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Mind</span>
evolving phenomena out of itself by the exercise of will, nor from an

matter and was imperceptible by the senses, it could not be proved.

Nor did he believe in the <span class="t0 t28 hoverable">eternal</span> existence of an invisible Self or Ego,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Soul, distinct from a material body. The only eternity of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span>
Buddhism was an eternity of ‘becoming,’ not of ‘being’—an eternity of
existences, all succeeding each other, and all lapsing into nothingness.
If there were any personal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> they were all inferior to the perfect
man, and all liable to change and dissolution.

In brief, the Buddha’s enlightenment consisted, first, in the discovery
of the origin and remedy of suffering, and, next, in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of
the existence of an <span class="t0 t28 hoverable">eternal</span> Force—a force generated by what in Sansk?it
is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Karman, ‘Act.’ The accumulated force of the acts of one
Universe produced another.

Every man, therefore, was created by the force of his own acts in former
bodies, combined with a force generated by intense attachment to
existence (upadana). Who or what started the first act, the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> never
pretended to be able to explain. He confessed himself in regard to this
point a downright Agnostic. The <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> himself had been created by his
own acts, and had been created and re-created through countless bodily
forms; but he had no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> existing separately between the
intervals of each creation. By his protracted meditation he attained to
no <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> than this, and although he himself rose to loftier
heights of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> than any other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> of his day, he never aspired to
other faculties than were <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">within</span> the reach of any <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> being capable of
rising to the same sublime abstraction of mind.

He was even careful to lay down a precept that the acquisition of
transcendent <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> faculties was restricted to the perfected saints
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Arhats; and so important did he consider it to guard such
faculties from being claimed by mere impostors, that one of the four
prohibitions communicated to all monks on first admission to his
monastic <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Order</span> was that they were not to pretend to such powers (see p.
81).

Nor is there any proof that even Arhats in Gautama’s <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> were allowed
to claim _superhuman_ faculties and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of working <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span>
miracles.

By degrees, no doubt, powers of this <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> were ascribed to them as <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span>
as to the Buddha. Even in the Yinaya, one of the oldest portions of the
Tri-pi?aka, we <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> it stated (Maha-vagga I. 20, 24) that Gautama <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span>
gained adherents by performing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> <span class="t6 hoverable">thousand</span> five hundred supernatural
wonders (Pali, pa?i-hariya; see p. 46). These were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> to be
evidences of his mission as a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> teacher and saviour of mankind; but
the part of the narrative recording these, although very ancient, is
probably a legendary addition.

It is interesting, however, to trace in portions of the early
literature, the development of the doctrine that Buddhahood meant first
transcendent knowledge, and then supernatural faculties and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of
working miracles.

In the Aka?kheyya-sutta (said to have been composed in the fourth
century B.C.) occurs a remarkable passage, translated by Prof. Rhys
Davids (S.B.E., p. 214):—

‘If a monk should <span class="t0 t10 t11 t17 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">desire</span> through the destruction of the corrupting
influences (asavas), by himself, and even in this very world, to know
and realise and attain to Arhatship, to emancipation of heart, and
emancipation of mind, let him devote himself to that quietude of <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">heart</span>
which springs from within, let him not drive back the ecstasy of
contemplation, let him look through things, let him be much alone.

‘If a monk should <span class="t0 t10 t11 t17 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">desire</span> to hear with clear and heavenly ear, surpassing
that of men, sounds both <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> and celestial, <span class="t0 t5 t8 t10 t14 t15 t21 t24 t28 hoverable">whether</span> far or near; if he
should <span class="t0 t10 t11 t17 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">desire</span> to comprehend by his own <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">heart</span> the hearts of other <span class="t0 t1 t15 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span>
and of other men; if he should <span class="t0 t10 t11 t17 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">desire</span> to <span class="t8 t13 t21 hoverable">call</span> to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> his various
temporary states in the past, such as one, two, three, four, five, ten,
twenty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred <span class="t6 hoverable">thousand</span> births, or his births
in many an age and æon of destruction and renovation, let him devote
himself to that quietude which springs from within.’

Then, in the Maha-parinibbana-sutta (I. 33, Rhys Davids) occurs the
following;—

‘At that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> the <span class="t2 t15 t24 hoverable">blessed</span> One—as instantaneously as a strong <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span>
stretch forth his arm, or draw it back again when he had stretched it
forth—vanished from this side of the river, and stood on the further
bank with the company of the brethren.’

And, again, the following:—

‘I <span class="t8 t13 t21 hoverable">call</span> to mind, Ananda, how when I <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">used</span> to enter into an assembly of
many hundred nobles, before I had seated myself there, or talked to
them, or started a conversation with them, I <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">used</span> to become in colour
like <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">unto</span> their colour, and in voice like <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">unto</span> their voice. Then, with
religious discourse, I <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">used</span> to instruct, incite, and quicken them, and
fill them with gladness. But they knew me not when I spoke, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span>
say, “Who may this be who <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> speaks? a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> or a god?” Then, having
instructed, incited, quickened, and gladdened them with religious
discourse, I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> vanish away. But they knew me not even when I
vanished away; and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> say, “Who may this be who has <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> vanished
away? a man, or a god?”’—(Maha-parinibbana-sutta III. 22, Rhys Davids.)

Such passages in the early literature afford an interesting
exemplification of the growth of supernatural and mystical ideas, which
led to the ultimate association of the Buddhistic system with ?aivism,
demonology, magic, and various so-called <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> phenomena.

I now proceed to show that the development of these ideas in Buddhism
resulted from its connexion with the later Yoga, which developed similar
ideas.

In the aphorisms of this later Yoga, composed by Patañjali, eight chief
requisites are enumerated (II. 29); namely, 1. abstaining from five <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span>
acts (yama); 2. performing five positive duties (niyama); 3. settling
the limbs in certain postures (asana); 4. regulating and suppressing the
breath (pra?ayama); 5. withdrawing the senses from their objects
(pratyahara); 6. fixing the thinking faculty (dhara?a); 7. internal
self-contemplation (dhyana); 8. trance-like self-concentration
(samadhi).

These eight are indispensable requisites for the gaining of Patañjali’s
_summum bonum_—the complete abstraction or isolation (kaivalya) of the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> in its own essence—and for the acquirement of
supernatural faculties.

Taking now these eight requisites of Yoga in order, we may observe, with
regard to the first, that the five <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> acts to be avoided correspond to
the five commandments in Buddhism, viz. ‘kill not,’ ‘steal not,’ ‘commit
no impurity,’ ‘lie not.’ The fifth alone—‘abstain from all worldly
enjoyments’—is different, the Buddhist fifth prohibition being ‘drink no
strong drink’ (p. 126).

With regard to the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t13 t14 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">second</span> requisite, the five positive duties
are—self-purification, both external and internal (both <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> ?auca);
the practice of contentment (sa?tosha); bodily mortification (tapas);
muttering of prayers, or repetition of mystical syllables (svadhyaya, or
japa), and contemplation of the Supreme Being.

The various processes of bodily mortification already described (see p.
228) were repudiated by Buddhism.

As to the muttering of prayers, the repetition of mystic syllables such
as Om (a symbol for the Triad of gods), or of any favourite deity’s
name, is held among Hindus to be highly efficacious[107]. In a similar
manner among Tibetan Buddhists the six-syllabled sentence: ‘Om ma?i
padme Hum’—‘Om! the jewel in the lotus! Hum!’—is <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">used</span> as a charm against
the sixfold course of transmigration (see pp. 121, 371-373).

Mystical syllables are very common. Sir A. Cunningham gives the
following as current in Ladak:—Bhyo, Rakmo-bhyo! Rakmo-bhyo-bhyo! Ru-lu,
Ru-lu, Hum Bhyo Hum! (Ladak, 386.)

Other mystical syllables (such as Sam, Yam, Ram, Lam, etc.) are supposed
to contain some occult virtue.

The <span class="t26 hoverable">third</span> requisite—posture—would appear to us a somewhat trivial aid to
the union of the <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> with the divine; but with Hindus it is an
important auxiliary, fraught with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> benefit to the Yogi.

The alleged <span class="t1 t11 t16 t20 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">reason</span> is that certain sitting postures (asana) and cramping
of the lower limbs are peculiarly efficacious in producing bodily
quietude and preventing restlessness. Some of the postures have curious
names, for example:—Padmasana, ‘the lotus posture;’ ‘virasana, ‘the
heroic posture;’ si?hasana, ‘the lion posture’ (see note, p. 336);
kurmasana, ‘tortoise posture;’ kukku-?asana, ‘cock posture;’
dhanur-asana, ‘bow posture;’ mayurasana, ‘peacock posture.’ In the first
the legs are folded under the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> and the right foot is placed on the
<span class="t1 t7 t12 t29 hoverable">left</span> thigh, and the <span class="t1 t7 t12 t29 hoverable">left</span> on the right thigh.

In short, the <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> is that compression of the lower limbs, in such a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span>
as to prevent the possibility of the slightest movement, is most
important as a preparation for complete abstraction of soul.

Then, as another aid, particular mystical twistings (called mudra) of
the upper limbs—of the arms, hands, and fingers—are enjoined.

Even in Muhammadan countries certain movements of the limbs are
practised by devotees with the <span class="t25 hoverable">view</span> of uniting the <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> with the
Divine. Those who have seen the whirling and ‘howling’ dervishes at
Cairo can testify that fainting fits result from their violent
exertions, inspirations, expirations, and utterances of the name of God,
and such fits are believed to be ecstatic states of union with the
Deity.

The fourth requisite—regulation and suppression of the breath—is perhaps
the one of all the eight which is most difficult for Europeans to
understand or appreciate; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> with Hindus it is all-important. It is
sometimes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Ha?ha-vidya. Nor are the ideas connected with it wholly
unknown in Europe.

According to Swedenborg[108], <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> commences and corresponds with
respiration:—

‘When a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> thinks quickly his breath vibrates with rapid alternations;
when the tempest of anger shakes his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> his breath is tumultuous; when
his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> is deep and tranquil, so is his respiration.’ And he adds: ‘It
is strange that this correspondence between the states of the brain or
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> and the lungs has not been admitted in science.’

The Hindu belief certainly is that deep inspirations of breath assist in
concentrating and abstracting the thoughts and preventing external
impressions. But, more than this, five sorts of air are supposed to
permeate the <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> and play an important part in its vitality. They
are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Pra?a, Vyana, Apana, Samana, Udana. In the Chandogya
Upanishad (V. 19, etc.) they are described as if they were <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> <span class="t0 t1 t15 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span>
to be adored and to be honoured by offerings of food. The Ha?ha-dipika
says: ‘As <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> as the air remains in the body, so <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> remains.
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Death</span> is the exit of the breath. Hence the air should be retained in the
body.’

In regulating the breath, the air must first be drawn up through one
nostril (the other being closed with the finger), retained in the lungs,
and then expelled through the other nostril. This exercise must be
practised alternately with the right and <span class="t1 t7 t12 t29 hoverable">left</span> nostril. Next, the breath
must be drawn forcibly up through both nostrils, and the air imprisoned
for as <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> as possible in the lungs. Thence it must be forced by
an effort of will towards the internal organs of the body, or made to
mount to the centre of the brain.

The Hindus, however, do not identify the breath with the soul. They
believe that a crevice or suture <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the Brahma-randhram at the top
of the skull serves as an outlet for the escape of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> at death. A
Hindu Yogi’s skull is sometimes split at <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> by striking it with a
sacred shell. The <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> is to facilitate the exit of the soul. It is said
that in Tibet the hair is torn out of the top of the head, with the same
object.

In the <span class="t5 t16 t21 t24 t25 hoverable">case</span> of a wicked <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> is supposed to escape through one
of the lower openings of the body.

The imprisonment of the breath in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> by taking in more air than is
necessary for respiration, is the most important of the breath
exercises. It is said that Hindu ascetics, by constant practice, are
able by this means to sustain <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> under water, or to be buried alive
for <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> periods of time. Many alleged feats of suspended animation are
of course mere and sheer trickery. It seems, however, open to question,
<span class="t0 t5 t8 t10 t14 t15 t21 t24 t28 hoverable">whether</span> it may not be possible for <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t0 t1 t15 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> of particular
constitutions to practise a <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of hibernation like that of animals, or
acquire some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of suspending temporarily the organic functions. A
certain Colonel Townsend is said to have succeeded in doing so.

A well-known instance of suspended animation occurred in the Panjab in
1837. A Hindu Yogi was there, by his own request, buried alive in a
vault for forty <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">days</span> in the presence of Runjit Singh and Sir Claude
Wade; his eyes, ears, and every orifice of his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> having been first
stopped with plugs of wax. Dr. McGregor, the then residency surgeon,
also watched the case. Every precaution was <span class="t2 t5 t11 t18 t19 t23 t26 hoverable">taken</span> to prevent deception.
English officials saw the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> buried, as <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as exhumed, and a
perpetual guard over the vault was kept night and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">order</span> of Runjit
Singh himself. At the end of forty <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">days</span> the disinterment <span class="t2 t4 t6 t9 t18 t19 t22 hoverable">took</span> place. The
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> was dried up like a stick, and the tongue, which had been turned
back into the throat, had become like a piece of horn. Those who exhumed
him followed his previously-given directions for the restoration of
animation, and the Yogi told them he had only been conscious of a <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span>
of ecstatic bliss in the <span class="t5 t11 hoverable">society</span> of other Yogis and saints, and was
quite ready to be buried over again.

What amount of fraud there may be in these feats it is difficult to say.
They may possibly be accounted for by the <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> that Indian Yogis have
studied the habits of hibernating animals; but in some cases the secret
introduction of <span class="t0 t14 t23 t24 hoverable">food</span> has been detected.

I may add that it is commonly believed throughout India that a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span>
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> is sublimated by intense abstract meditation never dies, in the
<span class="t0 t1 t7 t12 t13 t14 t17 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">sense</span> of undergoing corruption and dissolution. When his supposed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span>
occurs he is held to be in a <span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> of trance, which may last for
centuries, and his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> is, therefore, not burnt, but buried—generally
in a sitting posture—and his tomb is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> a Samadh.

With regard to the fifth requisite—the act of withdrawing the senses
from their object, as, for example, the eye from visible forms—this is
<span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> compared to the act of a tortoise withdrawing its limbs under its
shell.

The sixth requisite—fixing the principle of thought—comprises the act of
directing the thinking faculty (citta) towards various parts of the
body, for example, towards the heart, or towards the crown of the head,
or concentrating the will-force on the region between the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> eyebrows,
or even fixing the <span class="t2 t6 t19 t20 t26 t29 hoverable">eyes</span> intently on the tip of the nose. (Compare
Bhagavad-gita VI. 13.)

The seventh and eighth requisites—viz. internal self-contemplation and
intense self-concentration—are held (when conjoined with the sixth) to
be most important as leading to the acquisition of certain supernatural
powers, of which the following are most commonly enumerated:—(1) Animan,
‘the faculty of reducing the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> to the size of an atom;’ (2) Mahiman,
or Gariman, ‘increasing the size or weight at will;’ (3) Laghiman,
‘making the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> at will;’ (4)Prapti, ‘reaching or touching any
<span class="t24 t25 hoverable">object</span> or spot, however apparently distant;’ (5) Prakamya, ‘unlimited
exercise of will;’ (6) I?itva, ‘gaining absolute <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> over one’s self
and others;’ (7) Va?ita, ‘bringing the elements into subjection;’ (8)
Kamavasayita, ‘the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of suppressing all desires.’

A Yogi who has acquired these powers can rise aloft to the skies, fly
through space, <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t11 t12 t19 t22 hoverable">pass</span> through the key-hole of a door, pierce the mysteries
of planets and stars, cause storms and earthquakes, understand the
language of animals, ascertain what occurs in any part of the world, or
of the universe, recollect the events of his own previous lives, prolong
his present life, see into the past and future, discern the thoughts of
others, assume any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> he likes, disappear, reappear, and even enter
into another man’s <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> and make it his own.

Such were some of the extravagant ideas which grew with the growth of
the Yoga system, and were incorporated into the later developments of
Buddhism.

We learn from Mr. Sarat Chandra Das that in the monastery of Galdan in
Tibet there is at this moment a college specially devoted to the
teaching of Esoteric and Mystical Buddhism; while magic and sorcery are
taught in the monasteries founded by Padma-sambhava (see pp. 272, 274,
441).

Of course it was only natural that, with the association of Buddhism
with the later Yoga and ?aivism, the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> himself should have become a
centre for the growth of supernatural and mystical ideas.

Hence the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> is fabled by his followers to have ascended to the
Trayastri??a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heaven</span> of Indra, walked on water, stepped from one mountain
to another, and <span class="t1 t7 t12 t29 hoverable">left</span> impressions of his feet on the solid rock. Although
in the Dhamma-pada it is twice declared (254, 255), ‘There is no path
through the air.’

Perhaps the climax was reached when the later doctrine made every <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span>
possess a threefold existence or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> bodies, much in the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> as
in Hinduism <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> bodies are assigned to every being.

The first of the Buddha’s bodies is the Dharma-kaya, ‘body of the Law,’
supposed to be a <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of ethereal essence of a highly sublimated <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span>
and co-extensive with space. This essence was believed to be eternal,
and after the Buddha’s death, was represented by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Law</span> or Doctrine
(Dharma) he taught. The <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> seems to have been invented as an analogue
to Brahman, or the Universal <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> Essence of Brahmanism[109].

The <span class="t0 t2 t5 t13 t14 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">second</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> is the Sambhoga-kaya, ‘body of conscious bliss,’ which
is of a less ethereal and more material <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> than the last. Its
Brahmanical analogue appears to be the intermediate <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> (belonging to
departed spirits) <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Bhoga-deha, which is of an ethereal character,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> composed of sufficiently gross (sthula) material particles to be
capable of experiencing happiness or misery.

For observe that it is an essential part of the Hindu doctrine of
transmigration or metempsychosis, that a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> _without a body_ is
incapable of feeling either happiness in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heaven</span> or pain in hell.

The <span class="t26 hoverable">third</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> is the Nirma?a-kaya, ‘body of visible shapes and
transformations,’ that is to say, those various concrete material forms
in which every <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> who exists as an invisible and <span class="t0 t28 hoverable">eternal</span> essence, is
manifested on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> or elsewhere for the propagation of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span>
doctrine.

The Brahmanical analogue of this <span class="t26 hoverable">third</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> appears to be the earthly

It is evident that the extravagances of mystical Buddhism have their
counterparts in Brahmanism.

There is a Brahmanical legend which relates how the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> sage
?a?karacarya entranced his gross body, and then, having forced out his
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> along with his subtle body, entered the dead <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> of a recently
deceased king, which he occupied for several weeks.

The Yoga of the Brahmans, in fact, held that adepts, skilled in occult
science, might throw their gross bodies into a <span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> of unconsciousness,
and by a determined effort of will project or force out the ethereal
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> through the pores of the skin, and make this phantasmal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span>
visible in distant places[110].

And now it is declared to be a <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> that a community of Buddhist
‘Brothers’ <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Mahatmas, are living at this moment in the deserts of
Tibet, who, having emancipated their interior selves from <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span>
bondage by profound abstract meditation, have acquired ‘astral’ bodies
(distinct from their gross bodies), with which they are able to rise in
the air, or move through space, by the mere exercise of will.

Sir Edwin Arnold on the other hand, in his ‘India Revisited’ (p. 273),
states that he asked ?ri Weligama of Ceylon <span class="t0 t5 t8 t10 t14 t15 t21 t24 t28 hoverable">whether</span> there existed
anywhere Mahatmas, who elevated in this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> above humanity, possessed
larger powers and more profound insight than any other living
philosophers? Weligama answered, ‘No! such do not exist; you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> seek
them vainly in this island, or in Tibet, or in Siam, or in China. It is
true, O my friend, that if we had better interpretations of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span>
Buddha’s teaching, we might reach to heights and depths of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> and
goodness now quite impossible, but we have fallen from the old wisdom,
and none of us to-day are so advanced.’

I believe that the Psychical Research <span class="t5 t11 hoverable">Society</span> once sent delegates to
India who inquired into this subject, and exposed the absurdity of some
of the alleged phenomena.

Curiously in agreement with these extravagant notions are the beliefs of
various uncivilized races. Dr. Tylor, in his ‘Primitive Culture’ (i.
440), relates how the North American Indians and others believe that
their souls quit their bodies during sleep, and go about hunting,
dancing, visiting, etc. It is stated by Mr. Finn, late H. M. Consul for
North Persia, that he never could induce his Persian servants to awaken
him in the morning. They gave as their <span class="t1 t11 t16 t20 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">reason</span> that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> during sleep
wanders away from the body, and that a sleeper will die if awakened
before the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> has <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> to rejoin the body. The Indian tribes in
Central Brazil have the same belief, so says Dr. Karl von den Steinen
(recently quoted in the _Times_ newspaper).

Furthermore it is clear that the possibility of acquiring supernatural
faculties is not an <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> confined to one country.

Old legends relate how Simon Magus made statues walk; how he flew in the
air; how he lept into the fire, made bread of stones, changed his shape,
assumed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> faces, made the vessels in a <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> move of themselves
(Colonel Yule’s Marco Polo, i. 306).

We are told that the phenomena of European spiritualism are to be kept
distinct from those of Asiatic occultism. Modern spiritualism, it is
said, requires the intervention of ‘mediums,’ who neither control nor
understand the manifestations of which they are the passive instruments;
whereas the phenomena of occultism are the ‘achievements of a conscious
living operator,’ produced on himself by an effort of his own will.
According to Mr. Sinnett, the important point ‘which occultism brings
out is, that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> of man, while something enormously subtler and
more ethereal and more lasting than the body, is itself a material body.
The ether that transmits <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> is held to be material by any one who
holds it to exist at all; but there is a gulf of difference between it
and the thinnest of gases.’ In another <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> he advances an opinion that
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> is distinct from the soul. It is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> of the soul.

And again: ‘The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> is the prison of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> for ordinary mortals. We
can see merely what comes before its windows; we can <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> cognisance
only of what is <span class="t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">within</span> its bars. But the adept has found the key
of his prison, and can emerge from it at pleasure. It is no longer a
prison for him—merely a dwelling. He can project his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> out of his
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> to any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> he pleases with the rapidity of thought[111].’

It is perhaps worth noting that many believers in Asiatic occultism hold
that a hitherto unsuspected force exists in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Odic force (is
this to be connected with Psychic force?), and that it is by this that
the levitation of entranced persons is effected.

Others, like the Yogis, maintain that any one may lighten his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> by
swallowing large draughts of air, and by an effort of will forcing this
air to diffuse itself through every part of the frame. It is alleged
that this phenomenon has been actually witnessed.

The connexion, however, of similar phenomena with feats of conjuring is
undeniable. In the Asiatic Monthly Journal (March, 1829), an <span class="t1 t11 t12 t13 t16 t18 t21 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> is
given of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> who poised himself _apparently_ in the air, about
four feet from the ground, for forty minutes, in the presence of the
Governor of Madras. Another juggler sat on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> sticks put <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> to

These were removed, one by one, and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> remained
sitting in the air[112].

<span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">Long</span> ago Friar Ricold related that ‘a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> from India was said to fly.

support him’ (Colonel Yule’s Marco Polo, i. 307).

On the other hand, it is contended, that ‘since we have attained, in the
last half-century, the theory of evolution, the antiquity of man, the
far greater antiquity of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> itself, the correlation of <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span>
forces, the conservation of energy, spectrum analysis, photography, the
locomotive engine, electric telegraph, spectroscope, electric light, and
the telephone (to which we may now add the phonograph), who shall dare
to fix a limit to the capacity of man[113]?’ Few will deny altogether
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> of such a contention, however much they may dissent from
Colonel Olcott’s theosophical views.

There may be, of course, latent faculties in humanity which are at
present quite unsuspected, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> are capable of development in the
future.

According to Sir James Paget, in his recent address on ‘Scientific
Study,’ many things, now held to be inconceivable and past man’s
imagination, are profoundly and assuredly true, and it will be in the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of Science to prove them to be so[114].

Most persons will assent to these propositions, and at the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span>
agree with me when I express my conviction that mystical Buddhism and
Asiatic occultism are no more likely than modern European spiritualism,
to bear the searching <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> scientific investigation.

Nevertheless the subject of mystical Buddhism ought not to be brushed
aside as unworthy of consideration. It furnishes, in my opinion, a
highly interesting topic of inquiry, especially in its bearing on the
‘neo-Buddhism,’ and ‘Theosophy’ of the present day. At all events it is
clear from what we have advanced in the present Lecture, that the
practices connected with spiritualism, mesmerism, animal magnetism,
telepathy, clairvoyance, thought-reading[115], etc., have their
counterparts in the Yoga system prevalent in India more than 2,000 <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span>
ago, and in the practices of mystical Buddhism prevalent in Tibet and
the adjacent countries for many centuries.

‘The <span class="t3 t5 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">thing</span> that <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hath</span> been, it is that which shall be; and that which is

                              LECTURE XI.
_Hierarchical Buddhism, especially as developed in Tibet and Mongolia._


Early Buddhism was, as we have seen, opposed to all ecclesiastical
organization. It had no hierarchy in the proper <span class="t0 t1 t7 t12 t13 t14 t17 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">sense</span> of that term—no
church, no priests, no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of prayer, no religious rites, no
ceremonial observances. It was simply a Brotherhood consisting of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span>
who had renounced all family ties, all worldly desires—even all <span class="t0 t10 t11 t17 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">desire</span>
for life—and were pledged to devote themselves to meditation, recitation
of the Law, self-restraint, and the accumulation of merit, not for the
sake of saving others, but for their own deliverance.

It was on this <span class="t1 t11 t12 t13 t16 t18 t21 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> that when the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> died he abstained from
appointing a successor, and gave no directions to his followers as to
any particular <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of government. All that he said was, ‘Hold fast to
the Law; look not to any one but yourselves as a refuge.’ In short, the
<span class="t5 t11 hoverable">Society</span> (Sa?gha) he <span class="t1 t7 t12 t29 hoverable">left</span> behind was a simple brotherhood of monks which
claimed some <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of corporate authority for the enforcement of
discipline, but had no <span class="t1 t4 t9 t16 hoverable">Head</span> except the Law. Nor did Buddhism for a <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span>

it ever attempted to establish a universal hierarchy under one <span class="t1 t4 t9 t16 hoverable">Head</span> and
under one central authority, and although the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Ka?yapa as president
of the first Council (p. 55) is sometimes held to have been the first

claimed any supremacy like that of Popes. In point of <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> Buddhism
simply organized itself in separate monastic institutions according to
local ideas and necessities. And indeed the exigencies of healthy
growth, and even the simple instinct of self-preservation compelled the
scattered members of the Buddhist Brotherhood to attempt some such
organization very soon after the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> of their Founder. In <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span>
times communication was carried on with difficulty, and the Buddhist
Brotherhood could only hold <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> by combining for mutual support in
various centres, and adopting some sort of monastic government.

It was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> that every collection of monks naturally tended to
crystallize into a distinct organized <span class="t5 t11 hoverable">society</span> with certain definite
rules.

Naturally, the earliest constitution of each was moulded according to
the family pattern. The living <span class="t1 t4 t9 t16 hoverable">Head</span> of every monastery was a <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of
<span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> father, while its inmates were his children, and these, again,
resolved themselves into <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> classes: the first consisting of the more
youthful members of the society; the second, of those <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> more mature
experience entitled them to greater respect and reverence. Then, again,
some <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of pre-eminence was assigned to individuals who were
remarkable for greater knowledge, or sanctity of character.

It is easy to understand, therefore, how it happened that the Sa?gha or
collective community of monks was compelled in the end to establish
several gradations of rank and position among its members.

The following were soon recognized:—1. The ?rama?era or ‘novice’ (who
began by being a Chela or ‘pupil’ under education); 2. The ?rama?a (also
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Bhikshu) or <span class="t10 t16 hoverable">full</span> monk; 3. The Sthavira or ‘elder,’ who was merely
superior to others in virtue of his age; 4. The Maha-sthavira or ‘great
elder’ (sometimes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Sthavira? Sthavira?am); 5. The Upadhyaya and
Acarya. These last were teachers of different kinds, who received honour
in virtue of their knowledge; the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> positions of elder and teacher
being frequently united in the President of particular monasteries.

No doubt gradations of this <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> existed in very early times in India,
Ceylon, and Burma. But in India the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> Buddhistic <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Order</span> of monks
passed away.

In Ceylon and Burma, on the contrary, Buddhism has held its own. It may
even now be found in a purer <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> in those countries and in Siam than in
any other region of Eastern Asia, although it must be borne in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span>
that, when it was introduced there, it was grafted on serpent-worship,
Naga-worship[116], demon-worship, and Nath-worship[117], with all of
which, as <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as with the <span class="t0 t5 t11 hoverable">worship</span> of numerous Hindu gods, it continues
to be adulterated in the present day.

The Sinhalese (Koeppen, i. 207, 386) give a list of the first five
successive enforcers of discipline (viz. Upali, Dasaka, Sonaka, Siggava,
and Moggali-putta), and another list of ten successive Sthaviras or
elders, beginning with Sari-putta. These lists are untrustworthy,
especially as omitting the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Ka?yapa.

And I may here <span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> that the condition of Buddhism in Ceylon is a
subject which I have had an opportunity of investigating personally. I
visited Ceylon in 1877, and had many interesting conversations with
intelligent monks, heads of monasteries, and a few really learned men,
including a leading monk named Suma?gala, who described himself to me as
‘High Priest of Adam’s Peak[118].’

I found, too, that a lofty <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> prevails in Ceylon in regard to the
status of the monkhood. Theoretically, a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> monk is regarded as a <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span>
of inferior Buddha, and revered accordingly. There are boy-pupils,
novices, and <span class="t10 t16 hoverable">full</span> monks, as in Burma (see p. 259). The
admission-ceremonies resemble those before described (p. 77). Admission
confers no priestly powers. Those monks who are Anglicized by contact
with our civilization <span class="t8 t13 t21 hoverable">call</span> themselves ‘priests,’ but they are not real
priests, and have no sacerdotal functions except teaching, intoning the
Law, and preaching. They live as celibates and cœnobites in Pan-salas
(‘houses made of leaves,’ p. 430), or monastic buildings of the simplest
structure.

The <span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span> of such monks is said to be about 8,000, and their chief
duties are supposed to be to meditate a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> deal, to perform Ba?a,
that is, to recite the Tri-pi?aka with its commentary the A??ha-katha in
a sing-song voice, to repeat constantly the three-refuge formula (p.
78)[119], to teach and to preach, to fast and to make confession to each
other on at least four <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">days</span> in every month, at the four changes of the
moon <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Uposatha (or commonly Poya) <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">days</span> (see p. 84); these <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">days</span>
being generally in modern times made to coincide with the Christian
Sunday.

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">True</span> Buddhism does not require monks to perform public religious
services in temples. Nor is it the daily practice of monks to <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> an example of worshipping and presenting offerings there. So far
as I was able to observe, the duty of visiting temples belongs rather to
the laity. The monks receive offerings, rather than present them. As to
their dress, it resembles that represented in the Buddha’s images, and
ought to consist of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> pieces of cloth stained yellow or of a dull
yellowish colour. The principal garment is in one piece, but torn and
sewn <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> again, the <span class="t24 t25 hoverable">object</span> being to reduce its value and assimilate
it to a dress made of rags. The end of the dress is <span class="t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> over the
<span class="t1 t7 t12 t29 hoverable">left</span> shoulder, and generally so as to leave the right shoulder bare. In
some cases both shoulders are covered, or the right partially so.

A <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> deal of care seems to be <span class="t2 t5 t11 t18 t19 t23 t26 hoverable">taken</span> in Ceylon to instruct the youthful
members of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Order</span> in Pali; that is, in the language of their sacred
books (p. 60), and to make them conversant with the sacred texts.

I visited <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> principal colleges for monks at Kandy, which enjoy a
reputation rather like that of Oxford and Cambridge in our own country.
One is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Malwatte, and the other Asgiriya. In the former I noticed
a large central hall, in which the ceremony of admission to the monkhood
takes place.

At Colombo there has been recently a revival of learning, and a modern
Oriental College (called Vidyodaya), for the cultivation of Sansk?it,
Pali, and Sinhalese, has been established under the superintendence of
the learned Suma?gala, ‘the <span class="t17 t29 hoverable">High</span> Priest of Adam’s Peak,’ mentioned
before.

Each monastery in Ceylon has a presiding Head, and generally a temple
and library attached, with considerable property in land, but there is
clearly no organized hierarchy in the proper <span class="t0 t1 t7 t12 t13 t14 t17 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">sense</span> of the term, and no
supreme authority like that of an Archbishop; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> it is said that the
Heads of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> Kandy Colleges exercise a <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of control over the
after-career of the monks they have trained. I found that a certain
amount of <span class="t5 t15 t21 t27 hoverable">intelligence</span> and learning exists among the monks both at
Colombo and Kandy, but it must be evident to every impartial observer
that the habit of living in houses apart from the laity, of repeating
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Law</span> by rote, and of engaging in a <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of meditation which generally
amounts to thinking about nothing in particular, must tend, in the
majority of instances, to contract the mind, induce laziness, and give a
vacant and listless expression to the countenance. It may be safely
affirmed that the chief religious aim of the Buddhists of Ceylon is to
acquire merit with a <span class="t25 hoverable">view</span> to ‘better’ themselves in future states of
existence, and that their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t22 t23 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">highest</span> aspiration is to attain to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heaven</span>
of Indra (?akra, p. 207). They have no real <span class="t0 t10 t11 t17 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">desire</span> for Nirva?a (p. 141),
and still less for Pari-nirva?a (p. 142).

Passing on to Burma we may remark that although in Burma, as in Ceylon,
a pure <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of Buddhism has prevailed ever since its introduction by
Buddha-ghosha (p. 65), and is still existent, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> we <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> that the purer
system is mixed up, as in Ceylon, with the <span class="t0 t5 t11 hoverable">worship</span> of Nagas, demons,
spirit-gods <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Naths (commonly spelt Nats, p. 217), and with a <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span>
of Shamanism derived from the surrounding hill-tribes.

In regard to the gradations of the monkhood a more complete organization
exists in Burma than in Ceylon.

To begin with the boy-pupils:—In Burma nearly all boys become inmates of
monastic houses (called Kyoung) with the one <span class="t24 t25 hoverable">object</span> of learning to read
and write. They are simply school-boys and nothing more. Indeed, until
our advent, the monasteries monopolized the education of the country,
and to a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> extent do so still. The real gradations are as follow:—

1. The She? or Shi?, that is ?rama?eras or novices. These are properly
youths of at least fifteen <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> of age (but see p. 307); their hair is
cut off and yellow garments are put on for a time.

It should be noted that every male throughout Burma is required to enter
a monastery and become a novice for a portion of his life, if only for a
single Vassa. This is because the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> taught that every <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> Buddhist
ought to conform to his example and become a monk, although he wisely
abstained from imposing any irrevocable vows. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> process is often
merely formal, and sometimes only lasts for seven days.

2. The Pyit-se? or Pyit-si? (sometimes pronounced Patzin) or <span class="t10 t16 hoverable">full</span> monks,
who have the title Pungi or Phungi (sometimes spelt Phungee or Phongie),
‘full of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> glory,’ when they have been at least ten <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> members of
the order. They correspond to the ?rama?as, and are by Europeans <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span>
Talapoins (from their carrying fans of palm leaves). Their dress usually
consists of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> pieces of yellow cotton cloth.

3. The Hsaya (always a Phungi) or <span class="t1 t4 t9 t16 hoverable">Head</span> of a separate monastery, who
corresponds to the Abbot of European countries.

4. The Gai?-ok or provincial Head, who has a <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of episcopal
jurisdiction over all the monasteries of a district.

5. The Thathana-paing (Thathana = Sansk?it ?asana) or supreme rulers,
who correspond to Archbishops. They superintend all religious affairs.
According to Mr. Scott, there are now eight of them.

Occasionally instances occur of hermit-monks who lead solitary lives,
and sit motionless in meditation for years.

In Siam the gradations of monkhood are nearly similar to those in Burma,
and we learn from Mr. Alabaster that the monastic vow is not binding for
life, but can be cancelled at any time. This rule leads to every Siamese
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> spending at least <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> months of his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> in a monastery.

We have now to <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t11 t12 t19 t22 hoverable">pass</span> from Ceylon, Burma, and Siam to Tibet (properly
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Bod or Bot or Bhot, Sansk?it Bho?a). And here we leave the
simpler forms of Buddhism and are <span class="t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> <span class="t3 hoverable">face</span> to <span class="t3 hoverable">face</span> with that highly
developed system which, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> nominally resulting from an expansion of
the Hina-yana, ‘Little Method,’ into the Maha-yana, ‘Great Method’ (p.
158), was really the product of a still further expansion of the ‘Great
Method’ and its combination with other creeds.

In truth, Tibetan Buddhism is so different from every other Buddhistic
system that it ought to be treated of separately in a separate volume,
as Koeppen has done. In his elaborate and excellent <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> on this subject
he has remarked that for the development of a hierarchy no circumstance
is more favourable than isolation, and that this advantage was offered
in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t22 t23 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">highest</span> degree by Tibet. Up to the moment of its conversion to
Buddhism a profound darkness had rested on it. The inhabitants were
ignorant and uncultivated, and their indigenous religion, sometimes
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Bon, consisted chiefly of magic based on a <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of Shamanism.

To describe exactly what Shamanism is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be no easy task. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> is
said to be of Tungusic origin[120], and to be <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">used</span> as a name for the
earliest religion of Mongolia, Siberia, and other Northern countries.

Perhaps we shall not be far wrong in asserting that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> principal
constituents of Shamanism are the <span class="t0 t5 t11 hoverable">worship</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> and the dread of
spirits.

The inhabitants of Tibet and Mongolia and indeed of other Northern
countries believed that spirits, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> and bad, influenced the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span>
course of nature. They held that such spirits were able either to cause
or to avert diseases and disasters, to control the destinies of men, and
even to decide the fate of the lower animals. Hence it is easy to
understand that the chief function of the Shamans, or wizard-priests,
was to exorcise <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> demons, or to propitiate them by sacrifices and
various magical practices. In this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> they pretended to prevent storms,
pestilences, and other calamities. They were supposed, too, to
understand omens and to predict the future by watching the flights of
birds, by examining the shoulder-blades of sheep, and by similar
devices. Shamanism, in fact, with its Tibetan offshoot, Bon, had much in
common with the lowest types of ?aivism, ?aktism, and Tantrism, with
which the Buddhism of Northern India, Nepal, and the countries bordering
on Tibet, had already become adulterated.

When, therefore, this mixed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of Buddhism advanced from those
countries into Tibet, its approach was not resisted as an intrusion. On
the contrary, Tibetan Shamanism, although it had possession of the
field, was quite ready to meet the new religion halfway. The result was
an alliance, or rather perhaps an amalgamation; and this led to the
establishment of a complex religious system which I have ventured to
<span class="t8 t13 t21 hoverable">call</span> Lamism[121].

Lamism, then, is a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of Buddhism which, although based on the
Hina-yana and Maha-yana of India, is combined with Shamanism,
?iva-worship, and magic, and has a marked individuality and a peculiar
hierarchical organization of its own. This organization has been
compared to that of the Roman Catholic Church. Doubtless in its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>
receptivity Buddhism may have borrowed from Christianity, but Lamism
possesses certain unique features which distinguish it from every other
system in the world.

Unfortunately few Europeans have, as yet, penetrated into Tibet, and its
sacred literature has been little studied. It follows <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> that the
various gradations of the Tibetan hierarchy are not easily described,
and only a general <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> of them can be given.

We ought first to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">note</span> the boy-pupil <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Genyen, sometimes spoken of
as Bandi or Bante (= Bandya[122], a term more properly applicable to
monks). Boy-pupils are inmates of every Tibetan monastery; but under
exceptional circumstances a pupil may live with his parents. He may be
received after seven <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> of age, and until fifteen, as in Burma (p.
259). He is placed under a <span class="t10 t16 hoverable">full</span> monk, who teaches him and makes him
promise to keep the five chief commandments (p. 126). <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Though</span> sometimes
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> a novice he is merely under education, and not necessarily a
candidate for the monkhood. The real degrees of the Lamistic hierarchy,
as explained by Koeppen and others, are as follow:—

1. First and lowest in rank comes the novice or junior monk, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span>
Gethsul (Getzul), who has been admitted after fifteen <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> of age to
the first stage of monkhood by a Khanpo Lama or his representative. His
hair is cut off and he wears the monkish garments, and has 112 rules to
observe. He waits on the <span class="t10 t16 hoverable">full</span> monk, and assists in all functions except
blessing and consecrating. He has been compared to the deacon of the
European ecclesiastical system, but the comparison is misleading, as
shown at p. 76.

2. Secondly and <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> in rank we have the <span class="t10 t16 hoverable">full</span> monk, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Gelong (or
Gelo?). He corresponds to the Bhikshu, who has received complete
consecration, and is often <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> by courtesy a Lama (see note, p. 262),
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> he has no real right to that title. He is not properly a priest,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> it is certain that in Tibet he often discharges sacerdotal
functions. The ceremony of admission to the <span class="t10 t16 hoverable">full</span> monkhood can only be
performed after the twentieth year, and binds the recipient to 253 rules
of discipline[123].

3. Thirdly we have the _superior Gelong_ or Khanpo (strictly mKhan po),
who has a real right to the further title Lama, and from his <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span>
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> and sanctity sometimes becomes a <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of head-teacher
(Sansk?it Upadhyaya or Acarya). As the chief monk in a monastery he may
be compared to the European Abbot; but in respect of consecration he is
only a Gelong. Nor are any of the <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> grades of monks—so far as the
forms of consecration are concerned—higher than Gelongs and Khanpos.

At this point, however, we have to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">note</span> the special peculiarity of the
Lamistic system, namely, that some of the <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> Khanpo Lamas are
supposed to be living re-incarnations or re-embodiments of certain
canonized saints and Bodhi-sattvas who differ in rank. These are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span>
Avatara Lamas (see p. 190), and of such there are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> degrees, which
we may denote by the letters A. B. C. as follow:—

A. The lowest degree of Avatara Lama. He may be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> an ordinary
Khubilghan (from a Mongolian word—written by Huc, Hubilghan). He
represents the continuous re-embodiment of an ordinary canonized saint
(p. 188), or founder of some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> monastery. He is <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> by one degree
than the Khanpo Abbot, as presiding over a more important monastery.

B. A <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> grade of Avatara Lama <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Khutuktu. He exercises a <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span>
of episcopal jurisdiction over a still more important monastery than
that presided over by the ordinary incarnated Lama. He represents the
incarnation of a <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> Bodhi-sattva or deified saint, but he sometimes
claims to be an incarnated Buddha.

C. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t22 t23 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Avatara Lama commonly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> a Supreme or Grand Lama. He
is not an incarnation of a mere ordinary Bodhi-sattva (p. 188), but a
continuous re-embodiment of either a supreme <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> or of his
Bodhi-sattva. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> notable examples of this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t22 t23 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">highest</span> degree are the
Dalai and Panchen Lamas, who claim an authority, like that of a Pope or
Archbishop, over extensive regions outside their own monasteries. They
will be more fully described in the sequel (see p. 284).

It may be stated generally, therefore, that the Lamistic hierarchy
consists of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> lower and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> grades. We have, besides, to
reckon certain other distinctions of rank, such as those of the
Rab-jampa, ‘doctor of theology or philosophy,’ the Chorje (strictly
Chos-rje), ‘lord of the faith.’ These are sometimes associated with the
Khanpo or Abbot, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> slightly inferior in rank to that dignitary. It
is said that the Chorje often acts as a <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of coadjutor Abbot.
Practically they rank below the incarnated or Avatara Lamas. Moreover,
in every monastery there are numerous other subordinate officials; for
example, schoolmasters, teachers who explain the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Law</span> and guide the
studies of the brotherhood, precentors or choirmasters, secretaries,
collectors of revenue, treasurers, stewards, overseers, physicians,
painters, sculptors, manufacturers of relics, of amulets, of rosaries,
of images, and in some monasteries-especially those of the Red
sect—astrologers, fortune-tellers, magicians (Chos-kyong or Chos-kyo?),
and exorcists. The Lama is not only the priest; he is the educator,
schoolmaster, physician, astrologer, architect, sculptor, painter; he is
‘the head, the heart, the oracle of the laity.’

There is also a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> class of mendicant Lamas, who have vowed to live a
vagabond <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> for a certain <span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span> of years. They are better known than
some others, for they often <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> into British territory.

When I was staying at Darjiling, I encountered <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> specimens of the
vagabond class who came from some distant part of Tibet. They <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span>
themselves Lamas, though, of course, they had no real right to that
title. They were clothed in ragged garments made up of thirty-two
patches of different cloths, and wore thick buskins to protect them from
the snows. Then they carried a <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of knapsack or wallet of goat-skin
behind their backs, and in their <span class="t20 hoverable">hands</span> a sort of sacred drum or tabour
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> ?amaru (see p. 384).

According to M. Huc, these vagabond Lamas travel for the sake of
travelling. They wander through China, Manchuria, Southern Mongolia,
Kuku Nur, Tibet, Northern India, and even Turkestan.

There is scarcely a river which they have not crossed; a mountain which
they have not ascended; a Grand Lama before whom they have not
prostrated themselves; a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> among whom they have not lived, and of
whom they do not know the manners and language.

It should be noted that when an incarnated Lama is the <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t1 t4 t9 t16 hoverable">Head</span> of
a monastery there is generally a temporal <span class="t1 t4 t9 t16 hoverable">Head</span> to manage its affairs.

Then we must not forget that Tibetan Buddhism has also its organized
female hierarchy, on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t22 t23 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">highest</span> steps of which are female Khutuktus and
incarnated Abbesses, as <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as lower gradations of nuns and novices,
living <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> in their own convents.

The rules of discipline for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> Lamistic hierarchy fill at least
thirteen out of the 108 volumes of the Tibetan Canon (see p. 272). They
do not differ materially from those of other Buddhist countries. The 253
rules of the Pratimoksha-sutra (see p. 62) are said to contain commands

dress, food, habitation, and occupation.

It must be borne in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> that early Lamism, like <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> Buddhism, had
properly no secular priesthood and encouraged no intercourse with the
outer world, except for the reception of alms and <span class="t0 t14 t23 t24 hoverable">food</span> from the laity.
All grades of the hierarchy were supposed to live <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> as one
celibate fraternity in monastic seclusion, apart from mundane
associations. Their only duties were to meditate, recite the Law, and
obey certain strict rules of discipline. This strictness of discipline,
however, was not <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> borne with equal patience by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> fraternity.
It soon became irksome to a large section, and the same <span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span>
which arose in early Buddhism and generally arises in all religious
communities, occurred in Lamism. The fraternity of Lamas became split up
into <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> chief parties or sects—the strict and the lax. We shall see in
the end that these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> sects were distinguished from each other by the
colour of their garments, and especially of their caps, the former
adopting yellow and calling themselves Gelug pa or Galdan pa, the latter
adopting red (Shamar). Of course the lax or Red-cap sect soon infringed
the rule in regard to celibacy, and allowed the marriage of monks under
certain conditions, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> such marriages seem at first to have been
exceptional.

It is said, indeed, that in Nepal, under modern Gorkha rule, the
celibate occupies a lower position than the married monk, to whom the
services in the temples are committed. It is said, too, that the Lamas
of Sikkim and other northern countries constantly have <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">children</span> living
with them, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> they do not admit them to be their own (p. 152). Yet,
for all that, celibacy is the rule, and nominally, at any rate, the

cœnobites, who live <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> in monasteries.

Certainly in no other country in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> are monasteries so numerous
or on so vast a scale as in Tibet and Mongolia (see p. 426).

And, indeed, in all probability it was the difficulty of enforcing
discipline and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">order</span> in these immense establishments, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> some
method of securing obedience to a presiding <span class="t1 t4 t9 t16 hoverable">Head</span> acceptable to all the
inmates, that led to that strange re-incarnation or ‘Avatara’ theory
which is one chief distinguishing feature of Lamism.

The process by which this remarkable theory was developed is so
interesting and so important in relation to the subject of the present
Lecture that it deserves careful investigation, and to clear the ground
we must here make a brief digression and advert to some circumstances in
the early history of Tibet and Mongolia, as given in Koeppen’s laborious
work.

We learn from him that Nya Khri Tsanpo, who lived in the Yarlung valley,
was the first <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> of Tibet. After several successors came Srong Tsan
Gampo. This <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> was <span class="t9 t24 hoverable">born</span> in 617, and, according to a legend, exhibited
at his birth certain marks of perfection like those of Amitabha or
Avalokite?vara (p. 198). He is worshipped as a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Conqueror and
Reformer.

In the year 632, or about the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> when Muhammad died in Arabia, he
began the <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> of civilizing his subjects. To this end he directed his
minister Thumi (or Thonmi) Sambho?a to proceed to India, and make
himself acquainted with Buddhist writings. This <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> was the first
to design the Tibetan alphabet on the model of the Indian letters then
in <span class="t1 hoverable">use</span> (called Lañcha), but rejecting certain consonants and certain
vowels as unsuitable for the representation of Tibetan sounds, and
adding six new letters. Hence he was the first to introduce the <span class="t1 t3 t4 t7 t8 t14 t15 t16 t17 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">art</span> of
writing along with Buddhism into Tibet.

It may be noted here that Buddhism, to its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> credit, has generally
given some sort of literary education to the barbarous nations to which
it has imparted its own doctrines. It has also made the vernacular of
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> its medium of instruction, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> it has not always
translated its sacred literature or ritualistic formularies into that
vernacular.

The first Tibetan author was Thumi Sambho?a himself, who is said to have
composed a grammar and other books during his sojourn in India. An
important <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> translated by him into the vernacular was the Ma?i
Kambum—a Tantra work, alleged to have been revealed by Amitabha and his
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> Avalokite?vara. This <span class="t6 t8 t10 t11 t16 t20 t21 t27 t28 hoverable">book</span> describes the introduction of Buddhism
into Tibet as <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as the origin of the well-known six-syllabled
prayer-formula of Tibet—Om ma?i padme Hum (see pp. 371-374). It contains
100,000 precepts.

The teaching of Thumi Sambho?a seems to have been of an orthodox
character. He may perhaps be regarded as the founder of the strict
school of Tibetan Buddhism (already mentioned), which was afterwards
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Kadampa, and finally developed into the Yellow-robed sect, as
distinguished from the Red. After Thumi Sambho?a the propagation of
Buddhism in Tibet was chiefly carried on by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> princesses, wives of

They were worshipped
under the name Dolma, as forms of the wife of ?iva or of the goddess
Tara; one being <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the white mother, and the other, the dark;
representing the mild and fierce forms of ?iva’s consort[124].

The first <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> Lama monasteries in Tibet (called La brang and Ra mo che,
founded about A.D. 650; Edgar, p. 38) were erected at Lhassa[125] by
them or in their honour, and each monastery contained a renowned
wonder-working image, which each princess had <span class="t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> with her (see pp.
440, 441, 492).

After <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span> Srong Tsan Gampo, Buddhism declined in Tibet. One of his
successors, named Khri Srong De Tsan, who was <span class="t9 t24 hoverable">born</span> in 728 A.D. and
reigned from 740 to 786, tried to restore it. For this purpose, he sent
for religious teachers in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> numbers from India. These seem to have
<span class="t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> with them a very corrupt <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of Buddhism, which aimed chiefly
at counteracting the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> influences of demons by magical spells.

First came ?anta Rakshita, with twelve companions from Bengal.

Then the celebrated Padma-sambhava was sent for out of the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">land</span> of
Udyana (= Dardistan)—west of the Indus, north of Peshawar—where the

He was celebrated for his skill in magic, sorcery, and alchemy, and
became the real founder of the Red sect, after instructing several young
Tibetans in his own lore. At the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> he was remarkable for his

literature in Tibet. It redounds much to his credit that he was the
first to further the translation of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> Buddhist Canon (almost
entirely from Sansk?it books) into Tibetan.

But the sacred books had by that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> greatly increased, so that the

translations, commentaries, and treatises, corresponding to the
A??ha-katha of Ceylon (p. 65), and embracing <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t7 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">works</span> on all subjects

After Khri Srong De Tsan came a <span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span> of kings who caused Buddhism to
decline; but in the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t13 t14 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">second</span> half of the eleventh century it began to

He had an eminent Tibetan pupil named Brom Ton (Brom-sTon or Brom

after monastery was founded in the eleventh and twelfth centuries.

these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> chief monasteries of Raseng and Sakya maintained at first
their own separate independence, the presiding Lama of each claiming
equal authority with the other. Then in process of time, a rivalry
sprang up between them. Moreover the Brikhung monastery strove with the
Sakya, each trying to acquire predominance. Ultimately they appealed to
the Chinese authorities, who decided that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t22 t23 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">highest</span> position belonged
to the monastery of Sakya and to the Red sect.

And here we have to turn for a short <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> to Mongolia. That country
received its Buddhism, or rather Lamism, from Tibet. It is <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> known
that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Mongol conqueror, Jenghiz Khan, conquered Tibet about
A.D. 1206[128]. Before that period the Mongolians had come in contact
with various religious cults; for example, with Zoroastrianism,
Buddhism, and Islam.

They had even had some experience of Christianity; for Nestorian
Missions existed in Central Asia in the fifth and sixth centuries of our
era, and penetrated to China in the seventh century. All these religions
strove to convert the Mongolians, who soon became an important nation
through the conquests of Jenghiz Khan. That conqueror, however, had a
very simple religion of his own. He believed in one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> in heaven, and
one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> on earth; that is, he believed that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> had given him the
dominion of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> world, and he <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> himself to conquer the world.
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> he tolerated all religions. ‘As the hand,’ he said, ‘has many
fingers, so there are many ways to show <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> how they may reach heaven.’

Khubilai (1259-1294), the greatest of all the descendants of Jenghiz and
Sovereign of a vast empire, was the first to elevate his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> above a
mere <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of rapine and plunder; and it struck him that the best method
of civilizing them <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be by adopting and promoting Buddhism, which
the greater <span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span> of the races subject to him already professed.

Between the indigenous Shamanism of Northern countries and the doctrines
of Confucius, or of Islam, or of Christianity, there were no points of
contact; whereas Shamanism, as we have seen, had much common ground with
Northern Buddhism, which had become mixed up with ?aivism and magic.

It was this that led Khubilai to adopt the Lamistic or Tibetan <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of
Buddhism. He also <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> it <span class="t5 t8 hoverable">wise</span> to conciliate the <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> potentates
of Tibet, who had for many centuries <span class="t2 t5 t11 t18 t19 t23 t26 hoverable">taken</span> all real <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> out of the
<span class="t20 hoverable">hands</span> of their temporal chiefs.

And among Lamistic prelates, the <span class="t1 t4 t9 t16 hoverable">Head</span> of the Monastery of Sakya and of
the Red school in Southern Tibet had, as we have seen, acquired a <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span>
of sovereignty. Many monks of this Red sect married, according to the
practice of the Brahmans, and remained householders till a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> and heir
was <span class="t9 t24 hoverable">born</span> to them. At that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> they had a presiding monk, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Sakya
Pa??ita, and the Emperor Khubilai appointed Mati-dhvaja, the Pa??ita’s
nephew, to succeed him as <span class="t1 t4 t9 t16 hoverable">Head</span> of the monastery, conferring on him a
certain amount of temporal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> and making him a <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of tributary
ruler of Tibet. He was known as the Phaspa (strictly Phags pa),
‘excellent Lama,’ and in return for the supremacy granted to him, was
required to consecrate or crown the emperors of Mongolia.

Koeppen observes that Khubilai was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> the creator of the first
Lamistic Pope; just as Pepin and Charlemagne were of the first Christian
Pope.

The Mongolians also owe their <span class="t2 t11 t15 t19 t25 t27 hoverable">written</span> character and literature to
Buddhism. It was Phaspa Lama who invented the Mongolian alphabet. Taking
the Tibetan alphabet as his model, he invented a square character with a
<span class="t6 hoverable">thousand</span> syllables. He then undertook a new revision of the Buddhist
sacred writings, causing the Tibetan sacred <span class="t9 t12 t13 t25 hoverable">texts</span> (Kanjur) to be
compared with the Chinese. It is said that this lasted from the year
1285 to 1306.

Twenty-nine learned men, versed in the Tibetan, Ugrian, Chinese, and
Sansk?it languages, were occupied on the task of collation, and a few
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> later, the first Mongolian translation of the sacred <span class="t9 t12 t13 t25 hoverable">texts</span> was
begun by the Sakya Lama Choskyi Odser.

Khubilai, no doubt, was a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> promoter of Buddhism, and founded many
monasteries in Mongolia, and a celebrated one at Peking.

After the elevation of the Phaspa Lama to quasi-temporal as <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as
<span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> sovereignty very little is known about the <span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> of Buddhism
in Tibet, except that the successive Heads of the Sakya monastery
maintained their position under Khubilai’s successors, and of course
perpetuated and extended the doctrines of the Red school of Buddhism.
Probably they resided at Lhassa, and possibly at the Mongolo-Chinese
Court.

In 1368, the last Mongol emperor was expelled by the founder of the Ming
dynasty, after Jenghiz’s family had occupied the throne of China for
about a century.

The emperors of this dynasty did their best to <span class="t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t27 t29 hoverable">bring</span> Tibet under the
Chinese Government, and to conciliate the Tibetan Lamas by gifts,
titles, and other favours. But they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> it politic to prevent the
predominance of any one monastery. Hence they made <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> other Heads of
monasteries equal in rank to the Sakya Lama, and encouraged antagonism
between them. This facilitated the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Reform which Lamism underwent
in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of the Emperor Jong lo—a reform <span class="t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> about by the
celebrated Tsong Khapa, sometimes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the Luther of Lamistic
Buddhism.

Tsong Khapa, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> name is as much celebrated in Mongolia and Tibet and
among the Kalmuk Tartars as that of the founder of Buddhism, is said to
have been <span class="t9 t24 hoverable">born</span> in the year 1355 or 1357 of our era, in the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">land</span> of Amdo,
where the celebrated monastery of Kunbum or Kumbum—situated North of
Tibet on the borders of China—now stands. All sorts of legends, but none
worth repeating, are related about him. We may note, however, a probable
tradition that a learned Lama, ‘with a <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> nose and bright eyes,’ who
had settled in the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">land</span> of Amdo, and may possibly have been a Roman
Catholic priest, became his teacher.

In process of time, Tsong Khapa <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> out on a journey from Amdo to Tibet,
his <span class="t24 t25 hoverable">object</span> being to acquire a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of the doctrine from original
sources. He is said to have studied the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Law</span> of <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> at Sakya,
Brikhung, and Lhassa. It was in this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> that he became impressed with
the necessity of purifying and reforming the discipline of Tibetan
Buddhism, which the Red sect had corrupted by allowing the marriage of
monks and by laxity in other matters. Innumerable pupils gathered round
him, all of whom adopted, as their distinguishing mark, the orthodox
yellow garments of primitive Buddhism, and especially the yellow cap (p.
268); while the followers of Padma-sambhava and the more corrupt school
wore red garments and a red cap.

Tsong Khapa soon acquired vast influence, and in the year 1409 was able
to build on a hill about thirty miles from Lhassa, the afterwards
celebrated monastery <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Galdan (or Gahdan) of the Yellow school. Of
this Tsong Khapa was the first Abbot. His followers, however, rapidly
became too numerous to be comprehended <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">within</span> so limited an area. Hence
there arose in the immediate neighbourhood of Lhassa, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>
monasteries, Brepung (also <span class="t2 t11 t15 t19 t25 t27 hoverable">written</span> Dapung, etc., see p. 442), founded by
Jam-yang Chos-rje, and Sera ‘the Golden,’ founded by Byam Chen Chos-rje.

These <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> monasteries once held 30,000 monks of the Yellow sect, but
now have only 16,500.

Tsong Khapa wrote many works, which enjoy a quasi-canonical authority
among the adherents of the reformed sect. Many of them exist in
Mongolian translations, but they have not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> been fully examined.

Undeniably, Tsong Khapa’s chief merit was that he caused his followers
to revert to the purer monastic discipline, especially to the rule of
celibacy. He also purified the forms of worship, and greatly restricted
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> altogether prohibiting the <span class="t1 hoverable">use</span> of magical rites. Tsong Khapa,
too, is said to have re-established the original practice of retirement
for religious meditation at certain seasons, although as there was no
rainy season in Tibet, another period had to be chosen.

Travellers in Tibet have often described the many points of resemblance
between the Roman Catholic and Lamistic systems, such as the Popedom,
the celibacy of the priesthood, the <span class="t0 t5 t11 hoverable">worship</span> of saints, confession,
fasting, processions, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">holy</span> water, bells, rosaries, mitres, croziers,
etc. These resemblances and coincidences will be more fully noted in a
subsequent Lecture (see pp. 338, 339).

It is possible that Tsong Khapa may have imbibed some of his notions
from his instructor at Amdo already named (p. 277), who was either a
Roman Catholic missionary, or was familiar with the constitution of the
Romish hierarchy. On the other hand, it is certain that celibacy,
confession, and fasting existed in Buddhism before the teaching of
Christ, and <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> before that of Tsong Khapa.

In fact, Tsong Khapa’s reformation had been to a certain extent
anticipated, as we have seen, by the school of Kadampa, founded in the
eleventh century, by Atisha’s disciple, Brom Ton (p. 273).

Very little more is known about Tsong Khapa. He died in the year 1419,
or, as his disciples believe, ascended to heaven, and that ascension is
still celebrated during the festival of Lamps by all orthodox Buddhists
of the Lamistic Church (see pp. 345, 346).

When some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> after his death, he was canonized, he was regarded by
some as an incarnation of Amitabha, or by others of Mañju-?ri, or by
others of Vajra-pa?i (see p. 195), or even of the Maha-kala <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of
?iva, and his image is generally found in the temples of the Yellow
sect, and often between the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> images of the Dalai Lama and the Panchen
Lama, on the right and <span class="t1 t7 t12 t29 hoverable">left</span> respectively.

His followers of the Yellow school <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> themselves Gelugpa (or
Gelukpa), ‘adherents of virtue’ (or, Gal-danpa from their monastery);
their principal characteristic being that they adhered to the purer
discipline.

The chief point of interest in connexion with Tsong Khapa is the bearing
of his reformation on the development of the Avatara theory already
mentioned (see pp. 190, 265).

It is said that Tsong Khapa himself, like Gautama Buddha, had <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> chief
pupils, and that he appointed these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> to succeed him with equal
authority as Heads of the orthodox sect. He is also credited with having
been the first to promulgate the doctrine that no election of successors
to his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> pupils <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> at any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> be needed, as each of them on dying

There is, however, no historical foundation for such a statement.
Indeed, according to the opinion of some, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> Grand Lamas were
merely the lineal successors of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> eminent Lamas, Atisha and his
pupil Brom Ton (see p. 273).

After all, it seems most likely that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> Avatara theory was an
invention of some shrewd <span class="t1 t4 t9 t16 hoverable">Head</span> Lama, who, perceiving that the strict
enforcement of celibacy <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> prevent any hereditary succession, like
that possible in monasteries of the Red school, and foreseeing that it
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be necessary to prevent the suicidal divisions to which the
intrigues of an election to the Headship of monasteries—especially of
Grand Lama monasteries—would be likely to give rise, bethought himself
of a compromise between hereditary succession and election. After more
than one trial, the system was found to <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> so <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> that it was
eventually adopted with little modification by all Northern Buddhists,
and even by those of the Red sect.

The date of its invention is as uncertain as the name of the inventor.
All that can be said is, that it cannot be traced back to an earlier
period than the fifteenth century.

And here we must again guard against the confusion of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> likely to
arise from the usual practice of translating Avatara by ‘incarnation.’

We have seen that the doctrine of transmigration (gati) through various
embodiments, as applicable to all beings, is a fundamental dogma both of
Brahmanism and of Buddhism, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> in Buddhism transmigration properly
means a mere continuous transformation and reconstruction of the
elements (Skandhas) of being (p. 109).

The <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> is very dimly, if at all, adumbrated in the Mantra portion of
the Veda.

It is more clearly traceable in one of the Brahma?as, and distinctly
enunciated in the Chandogya Upanishad (V. x. 7) thus:—‘He <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> conduct
has been good, quickly attains to some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> embodiment as a Brahman,
Kshatriya, or Vai?ya. He <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> conduct has been bad, assumes an inferior
embodiment, as a dog, a hog, or a Ca??ala.’ In Manu the theory is fully
developed.

Now it is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> that in Buddhism this <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of transmigration may be
described as a continuous series of incarnations, although genuine
Buddhism denies the separate existence of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> between each
incarnation (see p. 110).

But the doctrine of repeated incarnations of one <span class="t22 t25 hoverable">individual</span> in six forms
of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> is quite distinct from the Tibetan Avatara theory. This theory
not only recognizes the separate existence of an immaterial essence or
soul, but also teaches that the <span class="t1 t4 t9 t16 hoverable">Head</span> Lama of certain monasteries is the
living, visible embodiment, for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> being, of the continuous
descent (avatara) on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> of a portion of the essence of the canonized
Founder of a monastery or of a celestial Bodhi-sattva or Buddha, who
will perpetually continue to descend from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heaven</span> and re-appear in <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span>
forms for the welfare of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> (see p. 109)[129].

A similar idea, we know, prevails in India, where the doctrine of the
descent (avatara) of portions of the essence of Vish?u and other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> is
common. There is, however, a noteworthy distinction in the Hindu
doctrine, because the descents of Vish?u are not continuous and
uninterrupted (see ‘Brahmanism and Hinduism,’ pp. 47, 107-116); and
although every <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Hindu teacher is supposed to be the embodiment of a
portion of the essence of a deity, each such embodiment is isolated and
single.

And here <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">note</span> that one theory is that the continuous descents of
Bodhi-sattvas and Buddhas into <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> forms were effected by means of
their <span class="t26 hoverable">third</span> changeable <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> (Nirma?a-kaya, p. 247), which belonged to
Bodhi-sattvas as <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as to Buddhas; or, according to another theory,
through rays of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> proceeding from the essences of the Bodhi-sattvas,
just as the Bodhi-sattvas themselves were held by some to have been
generated by rays of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> proceeding from the Dhyani-Buddhas.

Or again, the Dhyani-Buddhas might incarnate themselves not only
intermediately through their Dhyani-Bodhi-sattvas, but by the
transmission of rays of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> directly from their own essences into a
continuous succession of <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t0 t1 t15 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> of pre-eminent sanctity.

Hence it is clear that the Avatara Lama is no example of the working of
either Hindu metempsychosis or of Buddhist metamorphosis. And indeed,
re-birth, through transmigration and transformation, according to the
ordinary Hindu and Buddhist theories, is regarded as a <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of natural
act, whereas continuous incarnation through the descent of a portion of
a celestial essence into <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> bodies is a supernatural act.

Of course, as we have stated, there were lower and <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> Avataras,
corresponding to the difference in rank of Saints and Bodhi-sattvas (see
pp. 190, 265).

Examples of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t22 t23 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Avataras are the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> quasi-Popes, or <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span>
Kings, who are supreme Lamas of the Yellow sect—the one residing at
Lhassa, and the other at Tashi Lunpo (Krashi Lunpo), about 100 miles
distant, in a south-westerly direction, not far from the town of
Shigatse (or Shigatze, capital of the province of Tsang), and not very
far from our Indian frontier.

The Grand Lama at Lhassa is the Dalai Lama, that is, ‘the Ocean-Lama, or
one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> and learning are as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> as the ocean;’ a half
Mongolian half Tibetan title—Dalai (or Tale) <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> in Mongolian
‘Ocean,’ and Lama <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> in Tibetan ‘a superior Teacher’ (see note, p.
262). He has also the Tibetan title of rGyamthso Rinpoche (Rin-po-ce),
‘Ocean-Jewel’ (the Tibetan equivalent for Dalai being rGyamthso).

The other Grand Lama who resides in the monastery of Tashi Lunpo, is
known in Europe under the names of the Tashi Lama (sometimes <span class="t2 t11 t15 t19 t25 t27 hoverable">written</span>
Teshu Lama) or Panchen Lama (called in Mongolian Bogdo Lama). He has the
Tibetan title of Panchen Rinpoche (Pañ-cen Rin-po-ce), ‘the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Pa??it
Jewel’ (Pan being equivalent to Pa??ita, and chen <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> great).

Hence Tashi Lunpo is the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t13 t14 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">second</span> metropolis of Lamism (see p. 443). It is
said to have been built by Gedun grub pa, the chief pupil of the
Reformer Tsong Khapa, in 1445 (see p. 291).

Neither of these Grand Lamas are Popes in the European sense, for
neither are elected by a conclave of chief Lamas.

The belief is that when they quit their bodies at death, they re-appear
after nine months, or occasionally after the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t13 t14 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">second</span> or <span class="t26 hoverable">third</span> year, in
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">children</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> bodies they have occupied from conception.

The Dalai Lamas are held to be continuous re-incarnations of the
Dhyani-Bodhisattva Avalokite?vara (p. 197), while the Panchen Lamas are
continuous re-incarnations of his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">father</span> the Dhyani-Buddha Amitabha (p.
203).

Hence, as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">father</span> is superior to the son, and the <span class="t0 t1 t8 t11 t15 t21 t23 t24 hoverable">master</span> to the
pupil, the Panchen Lama at Tashi Lunpo might reasonably have ranked
above the Dalai Lama at Lhassa. But, as Avalokite?vara is the special
patron of the Lamistic Church in Tibet, his incarnation at Lhassa is
practically a more important personage than the incarnated Dhyani-Buddha
at Tashi Lunpo. Some hold that the Panchen Lama is only a re-incarnation
of Tsong Khapa, who was identified with Mañju-?ri.

It is said that the Dalai Lama exercises secular authority over about
four millions of people, including monks; although in the present <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span>
political <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> has to a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> extent been <span class="t2 t5 t11 t18 t19 t23 t26 hoverable">taken</span> from him by the Chinese
Government, which has <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> permanent Commissioners or Residents (called
Ampas) at Lhassa, and sometimes sends a special Envoy (Kin-Tche)[130].

The real <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> is, that since mere children, who are too young to have
received any education, are elevated to the Grand Lamaship, and most of
them either die naturally or are made to die before they have gained any
knowledge, the re-incarnated Lamas are generally unfit to govern, and in
monasteries which have an Avatara Grand Lama, an elected chief Lama acts
as regent or administrator of affairs, while the incarnated <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> is
supposed to lose himself in sublime heights of meditation and receive
<span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> homage[131]. This elected Regent also governs during the
intervals of the incarnations, and at Lhassa he is the real <span class="t1 t4 t9 t16 hoverable">Head</span> and
most powerful Tibetan official. He is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Nomun-khan or Nomin-khan
(or No min han).

The manner in which the Avatara doctrine is carried into practice has
varied at different times.

It is alleged that formerly the departing Lama, before he transferred
himself to another body, was in the habit of revealing where and in what
family he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be re-incarnated. Or occasionally it happened that
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">children</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> of age <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> out suddenly, as if

chief Lama of such and such a monastery.’

Or more commonly the sacred books were consulted; or the official
soothsayers gave their opinion.

But the usual rule was that at the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> of the Dalai Lama the
interpretation of the traditions and oracles about his re-birth and the
duty of discovering the family in which he was to appear were committed
to the Panchen Lama. When the Panchen Lama himself died, the Dalai Grand
Lama did the same service for him.

It was only natural that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">holy</span> <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">land</span> of Tibet, and especially the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">holy</span>

should even have supplied foreign countries with them.

When Messrs. Huc and Gabet were travelling in Mongolia they were about
to <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t11 t12 t19 t22 hoverable">pass</span> a certain Lamistic convent <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> stopping, when a Lama came
out and invited them to enter, that they might have an opportunity of
paying adoration to the saint enthroned within. ‘Our saint,’ he said,
‘is not a mere man. In our small convent we have the happiness to
possess a living Buddha! <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Two</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> ago he deigned to descend from the

Buddhas, according to M. Huc, are very numerous. Sometimes a clever Lama
builds a small temple and attracts a few disciples. Then by degrees his
reputation increases. Other Lamas build their cells near the temple, and
<span class="t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t27 t29 hoverable">bring</span> it into fashion, and proclaim him to be a living Buddha.

It is said, indeed, that some <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> Heads of the Hierarchy in Lhassa

distant Lamaseries, so that occasionally the supposed living <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> is
really the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> of some Tibetan Grand Lama.

In the present <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> the Emperor of China exercises so <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> an influence
in the nomination of both the Dalai and Panchen Lamas, that the
co-operation of the Lamistic priesthood has become little more than a
form. Still the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> is gone through, and the following description
(chiefly resting on the authority of Koeppen and Huc) may give some <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span>
of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> process.

When the Dalai Lama dies, or rather when his soul—which consists of a
portion of the essence of Avalokite?vara—has cast off one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> with the

found, or rather (as is practically the case) until <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> candidates

or its representatives.

The first stage in the process of election is to write the names of
these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">children</span> on lots, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> them in a golden urn. Then the
Khutuktus assemble <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> in solemn conclave. For six <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">days</span> they remain
in retirement. During all that period they are supposed to fast and to
be engaged in repeating prayers. On the seventh day, the leading
Khutuktu draws a lot, and the infant or child <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> name comes out is
proclaimed Dalai Lama. The Panchen Lama and the representatives of China
must be present at the time[132].

In a similar manner, the Panchen Lamas, Khutuktus, and ordinary Avatara
Lamas are elected.

The Mongolian mode of election is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> described by M. Huc. (The
quotation is not literal, and is abridged.)

  The election and enthronization of the living Buddhas is extremely
  curious. When a Grand Lama is ‘gone away,’ that is to say, is dead,
  the event is by no means made a matter of mourning in the convent.
  There are no tears or regrets, for every one knows that the living
  <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> will soon re-appear. The apparent <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> is only the
  commencement of a new existence, a new link added to a boundless and
  uninterrupted chain of successive lives—a simple palingenesia. While
  the saint is in the chrysalis state, his disciples are in the greatest
  anxiety, and the grand point is to discover the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> where their
  <span class="t0 t1 t8 t11 t15 t21 t23 t24 hoverable">master</span> has returned to life. If a rainbow appears, they consider it as
  a sign sent to them from their Grand Lama, to assist them in their
  researches.

  Every one then goes to prayers, and especially the convent which has
  been widowed of its <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> is incessant in its fastings and orisons,
  and a troop of chosen Lamas <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> out to consult the Churchun or diviner
  of hidden things. They relate to him the time, place, and
  circumstances under which the rainbow has appeared: and he then, after
  reciting some prayers, opens his books of divination, and at length
  pronounces his oracle; while the Tartars who have come to consult him,
  listen on their knees with the most profound devotion.

  ‘Your Grand Lama,’ they say, ‘has returned to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> in Tibet—at such a
  place—in such a family;’ and when the poor Mongols have <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t18 hoverable">heard</span> the
  oracle, they return <span class="t10 t16 hoverable">full</span> of joy to their convent, to announce the
  happy news. Sometimes the living <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> announces himself, at an age
  when other infants cannot articulate a word; but <span class="t0 t5 t8 t10 t14 t15 t21 t24 t28 hoverable">whether</span> his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> of
  abode be found by means of the rainbow, or by this spontaneous
  revelation, it is always at a considerable distance, and in a country
  difficult of access. A grand procession is then made, headed by the
  king, or the greatest <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> in the country, to fetch the young living
  Buddha. The Mongols often go through incredible fatigue and hardships,
  traverse frightful deserts, and sometimes, after being plundered by
  robbers, stripped of everything, and compelled to return, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> out
  again with undiminished courage. When the living <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> is found,
  however, he is not saluted Grand Lama <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> a previous examination.
  Doubtless, the simple Mongols are in this matter often the dupes of
  those who have an interest in making a Grand Lama of the baby. The
  title of the living <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> having been confirmed, he is conducted in
  triumph to the monastery of which he is to become Grand Lama; and as
  he passes along, the Tartars come in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> troops and prostrate
  themselves before him, and <span class="t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t27 t29 hoverable">bring</span> him offerings. As soon as he arrives
  at the convent, he is placed on the altar, and every Tartar, from the
  <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t22 t23 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">highest</span> to the lowest in the land, bows down before this child. There
  is no Tartar kingdom which does not possess one of these living
  Buddhas; but there is always another Grand Lama, chosen among the
  members of the royal family, with whom the real government of the
  convent rests. The famous maxim ‘Le roi règne et ne gouverne pas’ has
  been of old application among the Tartars. [See <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">note</span> p. 306 of these
  Lectures.]

It should be noted that the Lamistic community like to keep up the
fiction of these re-incarnations; and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> they pretend to
ascertain the genuineness of every re-birth by clear signs. Hence before
a re-born saint is installed, his identity is established by his passing
a <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of examination before a solemn assembly, thousands of witnesses
being present.

Some of the books, clothes, and sacred or secular utensils which the
dead Lama was in the habit of using, are <span class="t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> and mixed with others.
The child is then asked to pick out the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> ones, or he has to answer
questions as to the events in his previous <span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> of existence. If the
replies are satisfactory, he is installed as the re-born Lama amid <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>
rejoicings.

Koeppen asserts that no positive information as to the relationship
between the Dalai and Panchen Lamas is forthcoming. Some maintain that
both hierarchical systems developed simultaneously. Some say that the
Panchen Lama of Tashi Lunpo was the first Grand Avatara Lama, while
others hold that the elevation of the Panchen Lamas <span class="t2 t4 t6 t9 t18 t19 t22 hoverable">took</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> later,
and only resulted from the increase in importance of the Tashi Lunpo
monastery in which they reside (p. 284).

The Dalai Lamas may be enumerated as follow:—

The first is said to have been Gedun grub pa (otherwise pronounced Gedun
dubpa). Probably he was the nephew and chief pupil of the Reformer Tsong
Khapa. It was he who founded the monastery of Tashi Lunpo in 1445, and
he is by some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the first Lama of that monastery. His
birth is supposed to have occurred in 1391 or 1419, and his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> in
1473 or 1476. Then he was <span class="t9 t24 hoverable">born</span> again after ten months as Gedun GyamThso
(or Gedun Yamtso), the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t13 t14 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">second</span> Grand Lama, who is held by some to have
been the real founder of the Avatara system of perpetual succession by
reincarnations. He filled the Dalai Lama Chair from 1474 or 1476 to 1540
or 1542.

The <span class="t26 hoverable">third</span> embodiment <span class="t2 t4 t6 t9 t18 t19 t22 hoverable">took</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> in 1543, and bore the name Sod nam
GyamThso (or Sod nam Yamtso), ‘sea of virtue.’ He was the first who
really <span class="t2 t4 t6 t9 t18 t19 t22 hoverable">took</span> the half Mongolian title of Dalai Lama. Moreover, he
laboured hard to spread Buddhism among the Mongolians, and founded the
first <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Great</span> Lama’s Chair in Mongolia.

In his fourth re-birth, the Dalai Lama <span class="t2 t4 t6 t9 t18 t19 t22 hoverable">took</span> the name of Yon Jan Yam
Thso, ‘ocean of merit,’ and lived up to his 14th year (until 1602) in
Mongolia, when he moved to Lhassa.

The fifth Dalai Lama was the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Navang Lobsang (strictly Ngag dBang
bLo bSang), ‘wise speaker or eloquent sage,’ who is the most celebrated
of all. According to some he was the first real Dalai Lama, those who
preceded him being merely supreme Lamas of the Yellow school. His career
lasted from 1617 to 1682. He was a <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of Lamistic Innocent. But his
<span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> minority led to political disturbances. In the end, Navang Lobsang
overcame all difficulties, and as a sign that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> of
Tibet had been made over to him, built on one summit of the triple hill
Potala, where once the royal castle had stood, that palatial
monastery—that wonderful Lamistic Vatican—in which he still resides in
his continual re-incarnations (see p. 330).

Indeed the successors of Tsong Khapa had <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> <span class="t1 t11 t16 t20 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">reason</span> to be satisfied
with their position at that time. They had overshadowed the Red sect, or
reduced it to comparative unimportance. They had won over Mongolia,
which greatly aided them in their struggle for dominion. Monastery after
monastery arose there. The sacred books had been translated into the
Mongolian language, and thousands of Mongolians came every year with
rich presents to <span class="t0 t5 t11 hoverable">worship</span> the re-born Lamas at Lhassa, or sent their <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t25 t26 hoverable">sons</span>
there for education.

When Navang Lobsang died, his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> was concealed by the Regent, and
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> intriguing followed. In the interregnum <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> Dalai Lamas were
successively <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> up and deposed. These are not reckoned in the list of
legitimate Dalai Lamas.

Then a child was chosen, who had all the signs of being <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> to the
Lamaship. This was Lobsang Kalsang Yamthso; he is reckoned the sixth
Dalai Lama. He died in 1758, after gaining some repute as a writer.

The seventh Dalai Lama was Lobsang Jampal (or Champal) Yamthso, who is
believed to have died in either 1805 or 1808.

The next was Lungtog YamThso, who died a mere infant in 1815 or 1816. He
had <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> child-successors, who were all killed as minors by the acting
Regent. The last child was made away with in 1837.

If these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">children</span> are reckoned, Ge Mure YamThso must be regarded
as the eleventh Dalai Lama. He died in 1855. The twelfth was <span class="t9 t24 hoverable">born</span> in
1856, and seems to have lived till 1874.

The discovery of the present Dalai Lama is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> related by Sarat Chandra
Das.

  After the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> of an incarnate Lama, his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> is said ordinarily to

  forty-nine days. In 1875, one year after the demise of the late Dalai
  Lama, Thinle Gya-tsho, the Regency and the College of Cardinals at
  Lhassa consulted the celebrated oracle of Nachung Chhoskyong about the
  re-appearance of the Dalai. The oracle declared that the Grand Lama
  could only be discovered by a monk of the purest morals. Accordingly
  the Shar-tse Khanpo of the Galdan monastery, who was <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> known for
  his virtuous character and his profound <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of the sacred books,
  proceeded to Chhoikhor Gya, where he sat in profound meditation for
  <span class="t10 t16 hoverable">full</span> seven days. On the night of the last <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> he saw a vision, in
  which a voice from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heaven</span> directed him to go and see a miraculous
  sight in the Ya-tsho lake of Chhoikhor Gya. Awaking from his sleep,
  the Khanpo <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> to the lake, where in the crystal-like <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> he saw
  the incarnate Grand Lama sitting in the lap of his mother and caressed
  by his father. The <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> with its furniture was also visible. All on a
  sudden this mirage-like appearance disappeared, and he <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t18 hoverable">heard</span> the
  neighing of a horse. So much of his dream being fulfilled, he
  proceeded on the horse to the province of Kong-po, and, on the way, he
  happened to <span class="t8 t13 t21 hoverable">call</span> at the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> of a rich and respectable family of the
  district of Tag-po. Here he recognized the house, the family, and the
  child he had seen in the lake, and at once declared that the real end
  of his journey was obtained. On his report the Government officials
  and the College of Cardinals, headed by the Regent, visited Tag-po and
  escorted the infant with its parents in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> pomp to the palace of
  Rigyal near Lhassa. The princely child was only one year old when he
  was discovered. He is now ten, and bears the name of Nag-wang Lo-ssang
  Thub-dan Gya-tsho, ‘the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">lord</span> of speech, and powerful ocean of wisdom.’
  (This extract is abbreviated.)

A similar list of the Panchen Lamas who have reigned at Tashi Lunpo has
not been given. When Mr. Sarat Chandra Das was there in August, 1882,
the then Panchen Lama died from grief (so it was said) because he had
not been allowed to consecrate the young Dalai Lama, according to
previous custom.

The next important Lama in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Tibet (after the Dalai and Panchen
Lamas) is the <span class="t1 t4 t9 t16 hoverable">Head</span> Lama or Khanpo of the monastery of Galdan
(Gahdan)—the oldest monastery of the Yellow sect, founded in the year
1409 by the reformer Tsong Khapa (see p. 278), who was the first Abbot.
It once had 8,000 inhabitants. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> of Tsong Khapa is said to be
there visible, preserved from corruption and miraculously poised in the
air. Prints of his <span class="t20 hoverable">hands</span> and feet and his bed are also shown to pilgrims
(see p. 441).

But the Grand Lama of the Yellow school who comes next in rank to the
Dalai and Panchen Lamas is the <span class="t1 t4 t9 t16 hoverable">Head</span> of the monastery of Kurun (also
<span class="t2 t11 t15 t19 t25 t27 hoverable">written</span> Kuren) or Urga, in the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">land</span> of the Khalkhas in Mongolia. His
perpetual re-incarnation began in the sixteenth century. He is generally
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> by the Mongolians Maidari or Gegen Khutuktu, but his proper title
is Je Tsun Dampa (or Tampa) Taranatha. A Taranatha Lama (born in 1575)
completed a <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> on Buddhism in the Tibetan language in 1608 (Markham’s
Tibet, xlviii).

There is also a celebrated Avatara Lama at Kuku khotun in Tartary who is
a perpetual re-incarnation of Mañju-?ri Khutuktu.

Indeed Mongolia is a <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of paradise in which the monks of Lamism enjoy
perennial bliss, for the Mongolians are simpler and more <span class="t10 t16 hoverable">full</span> of <span class="t7 t13 t19 t20 t29 hoverable">faith</span>
than the Tibetans.

Another Grand Lama is the Dharma-raja of Bhutan (p. 297), and another
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Great</span> Lama is at Peking in China (see p. 299).

As to Ladak (the capital of which is Le or Leh), this is the most
western part of Tibet that has adopted Lamism. A?oka’s mission
penetrated to Ladak, so that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">land</span> in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> Kanishka’s <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span>
(that is, in the first century) was Buddhistic. Moreover, the Buddhist
religion (both Red sect and Yellow) has maintained itself there until
now, while in the neighbouring countries of Kashmir, Kafirstan, the
Panjab, etc., it has been displaced by Brahmanism, Islam, and ?aktism,
etc. We have little <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of the <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> history of Ladak. It has a
large and <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> monastery at Lama Yurru, near the Indus—in which is an
enormous image of the cloven-headed[133] Avalokite?vara—another at
Hemis, and another at Hanle. (See Cunningham’s ‘Ladak,’ Mrs. Bridges’
‘Travels,’ and p. 433 of this volume.)

In Tangut, all round the blue lake (Kuku Nur), Lamistic Buddhism has
been the established religion since the end of the ninth century. It
seems to have <span class="t2 t5 t11 t18 t19 t23 t26 hoverable">taken</span> a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> start upwards in the succeeding four
centuries, for it was in the province of Amdo, as before mentioned (p.
277), that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Reformer commenced his career. In the North-eastern
corner close to China is the Lamasery of Kunbum (Kumbum), where Tsong
Khapa was born. When his reputation increased, Lamas from all parts made
pilgrimages there. Sarat Chandra Das states that it is inhabited by
9,000 Lamas of the Yellow sect. Koeppen says that it has a University
with four Faculties, and an important printing-press, and that at the
<span class="t1 t4 t9 t16 hoverable">head</span> of it is an incarnated living Buddha. The Lamas from Amdo are said
by Koeppen to be more highly-gifted, intelligent, learned, and religious
than the monks of other monasteries. They are intrusted in Lhassa with
the most important offices, and are employed in the education of the
infant representatives of Buddha. Amdo is still almost a terra
incognita.

Passing on to Nepal—this country probably adopted Buddhism before the
beginning of the Christian era. It is said that A?oka’s missionaries
found their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> there; but there is no proof that Buddhism really
flourished in Nepal till the seventh century, and even then it never
existed except in conjunction with Brahmanism. It is probable that
Buddhist monasteries and Brahmanical temples always adjoined each other.
Indeed since the immigration of the Hindus into Nepal, and especially
since the invasion of the Gorkhas, there have always been <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span>
nationalities, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> languages, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> literatures, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> religions in contact
with each other.

In recent times Brahmanism has gained the predominance as the
State-religion, and Buddhism has degenerated, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> it is everywhere
tolerated.

It is a question <span class="t0 t5 t8 t10 t14 t15 t21 t24 t28 hoverable">whether</span> the <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> supremacy of the Tibetan Grand
Lama has ever been acknowledged in Nepal proper. But, according to some,
the Dalai Lama formerly had a legate or representative in the largest
and oldest Buddhistic temple of Khatmandu—the temple of Svayambhu-nath,
who is here at once Adi-Buddha and ?iva. The Dalai Lama also claimed the
ownership of this temple, which, he maintained, had been dependent on
him from the earliest times. But it is certain that, even if the Tibetan
Legate ever possessed the authority arrogated by him, he was compelled
by the Gorkhas to abandon his claims. Nevertheless the Tibetan tribes
now in Nepal still adhere to Buddhism. The same may be said of the
Newars, who are the original possessors of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> valley of Nepal.
They profess a <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of Buddhism, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> they reject the Lamas, and have
priests of their own, whom they <span class="t8 t13 t21 hoverable">call</span> Bandya (see <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">note</span> p. 263).

With regard to Bhutan (capital town Punakha) it is said to have become
Buddhist about 350 <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> ago. Its <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> ruler and incarnated saint
is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Dharma-raja (or Lama Rinpoche). He belongs to the Red-cap
school, and calls himself Chief of all the monks of the Dugpa sect. His
subordination to the Dalai Lama is little more than nominal. The
temporal Governor is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Depa-raja (Deb-raja).

The following titles engraved on the Dharma-raja’s seal of office will
give some <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> of his pretensions:—

‘I am the Chief of the realm. Defender of the Faith. Equal to Sarasvati
in learning. Chief of all the Buddhas. Head-expounder of the ?astras.
Caster out of devils. Most learned in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">holy</span> Laws. An Avatar of God.
Absolver of sins. <span class="t1 t4 t9 t16 hoverable">Head</span> of the best of all religions.’ (See Dr. Wright’s
Nepal.)

It is said that there are about 10,000 monks, and about 50,000 Buddhist
lay families in Bhutan. Many of the monks do not live in monasteries,
but hold offices under the Government.

Next, as to Sikkim—of which Darjiling, now the Sanitarium of the Bengal
Government, once formed a part. This is a small boundary country between
Bhutan and Nepal. It seems to have adopted Buddhism about the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span>
as Bhutan, or perhaps a century earlier. The Lamas there belong to the
Dugpa Red sect (p. 268). The aborigines, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Lepchas, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> they
venerate the Lamas, are really only half Buddhists; and their priests,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Bijna (Bhikshu?) beggars, are half devil-exorcists. The oldest
temple is that of Pemyangchi (see p. 432). Next come the important
monasteries of Tassiding, Changachelling, Raklang, and Tamlung (one
residence of the Raja, the other being at Chumbi in Tibetan territory).
There is also one near Darjiling.

We ought finally to advert briefly to China and Japan. It is noteworthy
that next in rank to the Mongolian Grand Lama comes the <span class="t1 t4 t9 t16 hoverable">Head</span> Lama of the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> monastery of Peking, who represents Lamism in that country.
Koeppen informs us that in China, for at least six centuries, there have
been <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> classes of Buddhist monks side by side, viz. first, the
Ho-shang (p. 92) or Chinese monks, who had become naturalized in the
year 65 after Christ; and, secondly, the Lamas. These <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> schools are
not distinguished so much by difference of doctrine and discipline, as
by the position they hold in the empire. The Ho-shang are little more
than separate fraternities of monks, tolerated by the State. They have
no hierarchical organization, and no bishops, but each monastery stands
independently, and has no superior except its own Abbot.

On the other hand, the Lamas constitute in China a public organized
society, acknowledged to a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> extent and supported by the State, and
possessing certain <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> and temporal rights over particular
districts. It is said, however, that the Lamistic hierarchy in China is
subordinated to the Government Committee for foreign affairs.

It is further stated that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> monasteries situated in or near
Peking are exclusively reserved for the Tibetan and Mongolian Lamas, and
that of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> Lamas who preside over these the chief is the
before-mentioned representative of Lamism at the Government Court (p.
295).

In China proper, <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">within</span> the eighteen Provinces, the <span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span> of the Lama
monasteries is said to be small, and these are generally to be found in
the Provinces nearest to Tibet and Mongolia.

As to Japan, it does not appear that the Lamistic <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of Buddhism has
penetrated into that country. In all probability Buddhist writings were
introduced there from Corea about A.D. 552[134], but it is certain that
Buddhism did not gain much ascendency in Japan till the ninth century,
and even then was not able to displace either Shintoism or Confucianism
and the <span class="t0 t5 t11 hoverable">worship</span> of deceased ancestors. In fact, Buddhism commended
itself to the Japanese, as it did to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> of every country to
which it spread by its receptivity; and just as in Tibet, it adapted
itself to the Shamanism which previously existed there, so in Japan it
adopted Shintoism, and turned some of the Shinto deities into
Bodhi-sattvas. Then followed the inevitable splitting up of Japanese
Buddhism, as of all other religious systems, through disagreements and
divisions; and in the thirteenth century various sects were developed.
As to these, we need only <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">note</span> that while some sects adopt the early
Atheistic and Agnostic <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of Buddhism with its doctrine of Nirva?a,
the principal sect <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Shin is decidedly Theistic.

Sir Edward Reed, in his <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> on Japan (i. 84), informs us that he met a
learned priest named Akamatz in company with the Archbishop of the
Western sect. This priest’s <span class="t1 t11 t12 t13 t16 t18 t21 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the Shin sect coincides with the
information which I myself received from a learned Japanese priest at
Oxford.

It appears that the members of this sect believe in Amitabha <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> as a
Being of infinite <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> and goodness, their chief prayer-formula being
Namo Amida (for Amita) Butsu, ‘Reverence to the Infinite Buddha,’ that
is to Amitabha[135]. They <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> <span class="t7 t13 t19 t20 t29 hoverable">faith</span> in the <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> and mercy of Amita
Buddha, or rather in his readiness to receive them into his paradise
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Sukhavati (see pp. 183, 204). At the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> they are required
to lead moral lives, and salvation is practically only obtainable
through their own works. The monks are allowed to marry and to <span class="t6 hoverable">eat</span> <span class="t6 t20 hoverable">flesh</span>
and fish.

Their doctrines have many points of contact with Christianity. The late
Mr. Kasawara of Japan, who belonged to this sect and was highly esteemed
by all who knew him in England, said to a Christian friend that ‘it gave
him <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> pleasure to meet in the Gospels many coincidences with the
aspirations of his own Buddhist faith, and that he greatly admired the
<span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> of the <span class="t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t13 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">Christ</span> as the concrete expression of the Inscrutable Essence
in its twofold <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of infinite <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Light</span> and infinite Love.’

Another <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> known sect <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Nichiren was founded by a celebrated
student and teacher named Nichiren. The Nichirens have been <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the
Methodists or Revivalists of Japan. They are very strict, and esteem the

Their prayer is to
the following effect:—‘Glory be to the salvation-bringing <span class="t6 t8 t10 t11 t16 t20 t21 t27 t28 hoverable">book</span> of the
Law!’

Doubtless Japan once had a peculiar hierarchical organization of its
own, which crumbled away not <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> ago, and need not now be described.
Even in the present <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> each sect may have its leader or Head, who
exercises a <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of episcopal superintendence like that of a Bishop or
Archbishop.

We have already mentioned (p. 200) that a female <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of Avalokite?vara
is worshipped in Japan and China as the goddess of mercy. Her name in
China is Kwan-yin, and in Japan Kwan-non; and she is represented as
possessing any <span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span> of <span class="t2 t6 t19 t20 t26 t29 hoverable">eyes</span> and arms up to a thousand, and sometimes
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> faces.

In concluding this Lecture we may <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">note</span> that Russia is the only European
country to which Lamistic Buddhism has hitherto penetrated. There are
adherents of the Dalai Lama among the Burat (Buryad) tribes on the
Baikal Lake, and among the Kalmuks on the Volga. Koeppen informs us that
the chief temple and monastery of the former is on a lake thirty versts
to the North-west of Selenginsk, and that the presiding monk is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span>
the Khanpo Pa??ita and claims to be an Avatara Lama. The Chief Lama of
the latter is said to be appointed by the Russian Government.

Hierarchical Buddhism naturally leads us on to the subject of ceremonial
Buddhism, which must be reserved for the next Lecture.




                              LECTURE XII.
                 _Ceremonial and Ritualistic Buddhism._


Having in the last Lecture described the manner in which hierarchical
systems were established in various Buddhist countries, we are naturally
led on to consider in the present Lecture the development of what may be
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> ‘Ceremonial and Ritualistic Buddhism’; for no hierarchy can
maintain its hold over the masses anywhere <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> the aid of outward
manifestations, rites, ceremonies, and appeals to the senses.

Early Buddhism was, as we have already shown, vehemently opposed, not
only to all sacerdotalism, but to all merely external ritualistic and
ceremonial observances. It swept away the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> Vedic ritual—the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span>
sacrificial system of the Brahmans; it rejected all penitential
austerities and painful bodily mortifications; it denounced every <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span>
of superstition, idolatry, and priestcraft; it maintained that to lead a
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of purity and <span class="t17 t29 hoverable">high</span> morality was better than all the forms and
ceremonies of religion.

But the very vehemence of its opposition tended to <span class="t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t27 t29 hoverable">bring</span> about a
reaction. Indeed, the history of all religious movements proves that the
teaching of extreme doctrines of any <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> is almost invariably followed
by a Nemesis, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> the teacher of them may himself not live to see it.

At the outset a reformer of the ultra type is sure to gain adherents by
his enthusiasm and earnestness, as <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as by his ardour in condemning
abuses, but a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> is almost certain to come when his followers will
themselves lapse into the identical practices which it was his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>
<span class="t24 t25 hoverable">object</span> to denounce.

At all events, it is <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> known that in the present <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> the Buddha’s
followers have invented a mass of complicated forms and ceremonies
wholly out of keeping and incompatible with the purer and simpler system
which he himself sought to establish.

In point of <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> in promulgating his creed did not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> into
<span class="t1 t11 t12 t13 t16 t18 t21 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> the impossibility of eradicating certain deep-seated cravings
inherent in <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> nature, which every religion aiming at general
acceptance must reckon with and satisfy:—for example, the craving for
the visible, for the audible, and for the tangible; the craving for some
concrete impersonation of infinite goodness and power; the craving for
freedom from personal responsibility and for its transference to a
priesthood; the craving for deliverance from the pains and penalties of
sin; the craving for an infallible guide in all matters of <span class="t7 t13 t19 t20 t29 hoverable">faith</span> and
doctrine.

Later Buddhism, on the other hand, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> itself to satisfy these
longings—these ineradicable yearnings of the <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> heart. It felt that
it could not establish itself on a firm foundation <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> hierarchical
organizations, and it could not maintain these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> external forms,
ceremonies, and ritual observances. It <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> turned the simple
monastic brotherhood into a caste of priests, and it attracted and
gratified the senses of unthinking multitudes by a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> variety of
religious rites, usages, and symbols, many of which are quite unique,
while nearly all are accompanied with superstitious practices implying
an amount of ignorance and credulity on the part of the people, quite
unparalleled.

This corrupt phase of Buddhism is especially dominant in Tibet,
Mongolia, and Northern countries. In real <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> it might be affirmed of
every Buddhist in Tibet that religious superstition colours all his
thoughts, words, and deeds. It is interwoven with the tissue of his
daily life, and is part and parcel of his worldly occupations. It is
equally part and parcel of the national life, and enters into every
Government transaction. Furthermore, it is fostered by <span class="t1 t3 t4 t7 t8 t14 t15 t16 t17 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">art</span> and science,
and ministered to by painting and sculpture. Nay, it is stamped on
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Nature</span> itself. It is impressed on rocks, stones, and trees. It finds its
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> to the summit of snow-clad mountains, to the recesses of
inaccessible ravines, and to the extremities of remote deserts.

To crown all, it might be affirmed that in Tibet religious superstition
goes on by machinery, quite independently of the <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> will. It is kept
in continual activity, night and day, by the flapping of flags, and by
the revolution of innumerable wheels and cylinders, which are acted on
by the forces of wind and water.

It may easily, therefore, be imagined that to give an exhaustive <span class="t1 t11 t12 t13 t16 t18 t21 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span>
of all the ceremonies and superstitious practices of Tibetan, or, as it
may be called, Lamistic Buddhism, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> require the command of unlimited
time. They have been treated of by Koeppen in his <span class="t0 t2 t5 t13 t14 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">second</span> volume, and by
Schlagintweit in his ‘Buddhism in Tibet,’ and have been illustrated by
descriptions in Huc’s travels[136], in Markham’s <span class="t1 t11 t12 t13 t16 t18 t21 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the travels
of Bogle, Turner, and Manning, and in the recent narrative of Mr. Sarat
Chandra Das’ Journey. All I can attempt is to give a concise <span class="t1 t11 t12 t13 t16 t18 t21 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of
some of the chief Lamistic observances, taking the books just named as
my authorities, and adding whatever information I have been able to
collect myself from other sources, while travelling in Buddhist
countries.

We must, however, guard against the notion that ceremonial observances
are confined to Tibet and Northern regions. They are now more or less
prevalent in Burma and Ceylon, which have adopted much of the Maha-yana
system, and to these countries we must give our first attention. Even
the ceremonies now observed at the reception of novices and monks in
Burma and Ceylon are less simple than the early admission-forms already
described (pp. 77, 78, 256).

Of course every novice has to cut off his hair. He does this to prove
that he is ready to give up the most beautiful and highly-prized of all
his personal ornaments for the sake of a religious life.

But other forms have to be gone through in the present day, and I now
give an <span class="t1 t11 t12 t13 t16 t18 t21 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the admission-ceremony of a novice—as performed in
Burma—based on the description in the <span class="t26 hoverable">third</span> <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">chapter</span> of Shway Yoe’s
interesting volume <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> ‘the Burman[137].’

It is <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> understood that, according to the strict letter of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">law</span>
(p. 77 of the present Lectures), a boy ought not to be admitted to the
novitiate until he is fifteen, but in modern times, the admission often
takes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> at twelve or even eleven <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> of age, the belief being that
until a boy is so admitted he cannot claim to be more than an animal.

The first point to be noted is that his admission involves the dropping
of his secular name, and the receiving of another title to mark that it
is then possible for him to escape the suffering of life. As he is sure
to have been a scholar or pupil in a monastery (Kyoung) before applying
to be admitted as a novice, he has learnt beforehand all the forms of
<span class="t0 t5 t11 hoverable">worship</span> and much that will be required of him during his monastic life;
for instance, that he is to address senior monks in a particular manner
and to wait <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> them respectfully; that he is to walk through the
streets keeping his <span class="t2 t6 t19 t20 t26 t29 hoverable">eyes</span> fixed on the ground, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> gazing about, even
if he have to <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t11 t12 t19 t22 hoverable">pass</span> a pageant or attractive spectacle of any kind; that
he is to wear his garments in the prescribed fashion; that he is to <span class="t6 hoverable">eat</span>
with moderation and dignity.

On the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> appointed for the induction-ceremony, the young neophyte
dresses in his gayest clothes, and mounted on a pony, passes at a foot’s
pace through the town or village. A band of music goes before him, and
all his friends dressed in their best garments, follow in a crowd, the
young <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> dancing and singing, the girls smiling and laughing. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> he
proceeds in procession to the houses of his relations, to bid them
farewell. Of course the introductory observance is intended as a <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of
dramatic imitation of Gautama Buddha’s celebrated abandonment of his own
family and worldly associates, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the Mahabhinishkrama?a, ‘the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>
going forth from home’ (see p. 28 of this volume). When the round of
visits is finished, the would-be novice turns back with all his
companions to his parents’ house. There he finds a large <span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span> of
persons assembled, and among them the <span class="t1 t4 t9 t16 hoverable">Head</span> of the monastery, with
several of his brother monks. These are seated on a raised dais in front
of which are the offerings intended for presentation to them, consisting
of fruit, cooked food, yellow cloth, etc.

The monks (‘Talapoins’) seated in a row, carefully hold up their large
fan-like screens to shut out the female portion of the assemblage from
their view. Portions of the Vinaya (p. 62 of this volume) are then
recited, after which the would-be novice is made to throw off all his
fine clothes and bind a piece of white cloth round his loins. Then his
hair is cut off close, and his <span class="t1 t4 t9 t16 hoverable">head</span> is carefully shaved and washed. Next
he is <span class="t2 t5 t11 t18 t19 t23 t26 hoverable">taken</span> to a bath, and after immersion in pure water, is <span class="t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span>
once more, partially clothed, before the assembled monks. Prostrating
himself <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> times before them, he raises his <span class="t20 hoverable">hands</span> in reverence, and,
using the regular Pali <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of words, asks to be admitted to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">holy</span>
brotherhood. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Upon</span> that the <span class="t1 t4 t9 t16 hoverable">Head</span> of the monastery presents him with the
yellow monastic garments. These are duly put on, and the mendicant’s
bowl is hung round his neck. The ceremony concludes by the formal
announcement of his having become a member of the monastery.

The present admission-ceremony in Ceylon appears to be of a simpler
character. In <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> it differs little from the <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> form. Those boys
who are destined for the novitiate usually begin their connexion with
the monastery to which they intend to belong by first becoming pupils in
the monastery-school. The devotion of the monkhood to the education of
mere boys was perhaps one of the best results of the progress and
development of Buddhism. In monasteries, all boys may learn to read and
write[138]. There also they gain some experience of monastic duties and
requirements, so that when the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> comes for any pupil to enter the
novitiate, his preparedness is <span class="t2 t5 t11 t18 t19 t23 t26 hoverable">taken</span> for granted. He merely makes known
his intention to a superior or senior monk. Then having shaved his head,
and undergone the ceremony of bathing, the applicant, who has furnished
himself with the proper yellow robes, presents them to the superior
monk, and requests to be allowed to receive them again that he may
become a novice. Next, on his reciting the three-refuge formulary, and
the ten prohibitions, he is permitted to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> back the monkish garments
and to put them on. He is then formally admitted, and his admission
announced to the other members of the monastery (Hardy’s Eastern
Monachism, p. 23). It may be noted that the monkish garments do not
include a head-covering as in Northern countries.

As to the ceremony of admission to the <span class="t10 t16 hoverable">full</span> monkhood, it differs so
little from the <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> rite (described at p. 79), that no further
description need here be given.

With regard to the religious services performed in the monastic
institutions of modern times, they are, of course, a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> advance on
the simple formularies <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">used</span> in early days, before the establishment and
organization of large monasteries.

The earlier and purer Buddhism, as we have seen, had only one religious
formula, and that was a simple expression of veneration for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span>
jewels—the Buddha, his Law, and his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Order</span> of Monks (p. 78).

Any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of <span class="t0 t5 t11 hoverable">worship</span> was altogether out of place, if not a mere mockery,
when there was no supreme Being to worship; when the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> himself, who
never claimed to be more than a perfected man, had passed away into
non-existence, and when all that he <span class="t1 t7 t12 t29 hoverable">left</span> behind was the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> ideal of
his own memory, to be venerated and imitated.

When, however, monastic establishments were organized and the doctrine
became developed, a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> development of <span class="t0 t5 t11 hoverable">worship</span> <span class="t2 t4 t6 t9 t18 t19 t22 hoverable">took</span> place.

To illustrate this I submit a description of daily <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> in a Burmese
monastery, based on the information given by Shway Yoe (p. 307), and
often using his words.

It appears that every monastic community in Burma is roused a little
before daylight by the sound of a big bell, beaten with a wooden mallet.
Each monk has then to rise, rinse out his mouth, wash his <span class="t20 hoverable">hands</span> and
face, arrange his dress (the same in which he has slept all night) and
recite a few formularies, among which is one to the following
effect:—‘How <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> a favour has the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> bestowed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> me in
manifesting to me his law, through the observance of which I may escape
the purgatorial penalties of hell and secure salvation!’ All the members
of the fraternity then station themselves before the image of the
Buddha, with the Abbot at their head, and the rest of the brotherhood,
<span class="t10 t16 hoverable">full</span> monks, novices and scholars, according to their order. This done,
they proceed to intone the morning service. At its conclusion each
stands before the <span class="t1 t4 t9 t16 hoverable">Head</span> of the monastery, and pledges himself to observe
during the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> all the rules and precepts incumbent <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> him. They then
separate—the pupils and novices to sweep the floor of the monastery,
<span class="t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t27 t29 hoverable">bring</span> drinking water, filter it, etc., the more advanced novices and
<span class="t10 t16 hoverable">full</span> monks to tend the sacred trees; the elders to meditate in solitude
on the miseries of life, such meditation being beyond all other actions
meritorious. Some gather flowers and offer them before the relic-shrine
(Dagaba).

Then comes a repast, preceded by a grace to the effect that the <span class="t0 t14 t23 t24 hoverable">food</span> is
eaten to satisfy bodily wants, not to please the appetite; that garments
are <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">used</span> to cover nakedness, not for vanity; that health is desired to
give strength for the performance of religious <span class="t0 t5 t11 hoverable">worship</span> and meditation.
After the meal, all devote themselves to study or to teaching. Then
arranging themselves in file, they <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> out with the Abbot at their <span class="t1 t4 t9 t16 hoverable">head</span>
to receive their <span class="t0 t14 t23 t24 hoverable">food</span> (not beg). Silently they move on through the
streets, fixing their <span class="t2 t6 t19 t20 t26 t29 hoverable">eyes</span> steadily on the ground six feet before them,
meditating on the vanity and mutability of all things, and only halting
when a layman emerges from some door to pour his contribution of rice or
fruit or vegetables into their alms-bowls. The gift received, not a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span>
or a syllable of thanks is uttered; for is it not the receivers who
confer the favour and not the givers? In this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> they circle back to
the monastery.

On their return from their perambulation a portion of the <span class="t0 t14 t23 t24 hoverable">food</span> is
offered to the Buddha, and then all proceed to <span class="t6 hoverable">eat</span> the remainder,
consisting perhaps of cooked rice, boiled peas, fish, cocoa-nut cakes,
cucumbers, or even curried <span class="t6 t20 hoverable">flesh</span> and fowl, usually wrapped separately in
plantain-leaves. Next the bowls are washed, and a few hymns are chanted
before the Buddha’s image. During the succeeding hour the boy-scholars
are allowed to play about, while the monks <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t11 t12 t19 t22 hoverable">pass</span> their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> in
conversation, and the Abbot receives <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> who come to pay their
respects. All visitors prostrate themselves before him <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> times, once
for the Buddha, once for the Law, and once for the Monkhood. The Abbot
in return says: ‘May the supporter’ (so he calls all laymen; compare p.
89), ‘as a reward for merit, be freed from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> calamities (of war,
pestilence, and famine)!’ At about half-past eleven the last regular
meal of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> is eaten. Monks are forbidden to <span class="t6 hoverable">eat</span> after noon. When
the mid-day meal is over, all return to work. Some undertake the
teaching of the boy-scholars. Others read the <span class="t9 t12 t13 t25 hoverable">texts</span> of the Tri-pi?aka
with their commentaries, or superintend the writers who are copying
manuscripts. Some of the older members of the monastery talk with the
idlers, who are to be found lounging about the precincts, and some sink
into deep meditation, which probably ends in deep sleep.

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> this profound meditation is believed to be all important, for is it
not the path to Arhatship, to Nirva?a, and to the acquisition of
supernatural faculties (see p. 245)? Other monks tell the beads of their
rosaries and repeat the prescribed formularies, such as: ‘All is
changeful, all is sorrowful, all is unreal,’ followed by invocations to
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> holies (see p. 175). Between <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> and four o’clock the
lessons are finished, and the scholars perform any domestic duties
required in the monastery. This is the chief return for the teaching
they receive. Then most of the pupils go to their own homes for dinner.
As to the youthful novices or junior monks, these are all obliged to
fast like the <span class="t10 t16 hoverable">full</span> monks. Many of them go out with some of the senior
monks for a solemn walk. Then at sunset the far-reaching notes of the
bell summon the walkers back to the monastery. All must be <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">within</span> the
walls before the <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t21 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">sun</span> goes down. The day’s duties now draw to a close.
The boy-pupils are made to repeat all they have learned during the day,
and some of the Pali rituals are chanted ‘with spasmodic energy.’ At
half-past eight or nine there are further recitations before the image
of the Buddha. All assemble, as in the morning, and <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> intone the
hymns. When the last sound of the chant has died away, one of the
novices stands up and proclaims the hour, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> of the week, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> of the
month, and <span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span> of the year. Then all bow before the Buddha’s image,
and thrice before the <span class="t1 t4 t9 t16 hoverable">Head</span> of the monastery, and retire to rest (see
Shway Yoe’s ‘Burman’).

It is noteworthy that severe asceticism and painful austerities—as
practised among the Hindus from the earliest times up to the present <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span>
(described at pp. 228-230 of this volume)—form no part of the duties of
Buddhist monks; for Buddhism has never sanctioned bodily torture, as
Brahmanism has done.

We now <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t11 t12 t19 t22 hoverable">pass</span> on to a description of the observances usual during the
period of Vassa (see pp. 82-84).

Mr. Dickson has given us some valuable notes on the method of keeping
this season in Ceylon, and I venture to found a short narrative on the
information he has communicated[139].

It seems that the villagers of Ceylon esteem it a privilege and a <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span>
of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> merit to send for one or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> monk-priests from a monastery and
to minister to their wants, as <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as listen to their preaching and
recitations during Vassa.

The season begins on the fifteenth <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> of the eighth month; that is, on
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> of <span class="t10 t16 hoverable">full</span> moon in the month Asha?ha (June, July).

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> months. They prepare a chamber for his sleeping
accommodation, a room for his meals, a temporary chapel for the
reception of the Buddha’s image, of the relic-casket and of the sacred
books, and a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> in which he can recite the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">law</span> and explain it.

On the first <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> of Vassa the villagers put on their holiday dresses,
and <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> off with music, dancers, singers, and flags for the monastery,
where the priest, whom they <span class="t0 t10 t11 t17 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">desire</span> to invite, resides. Thence they
conduct him in procession to their homes. His first act, after his
arrival, is to <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> up the image and arrange the relic-casket and books.
An altar is placed in front of the image, and on this the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> proceed
to make their offerings of flowers and perfumes. Next every villager
contributes something for the priest’s food, such as tea, sugar,
honeycomb, orange-juice, and the like. The priest, in return, pronounces
a benediction, and says:—‘By virtue of this first <span class="t6 hoverable">offering</span> made for the
sake of the Buddha, who is like <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">unto</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t21 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">sun</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> and men, and by

Then the monk-priest proceeds to the preaching-chamber, in the middle of
which is a chair with a cushion. He takes his seat, and, holding a
screen before his <span class="t3 hoverable">face</span> to prevent his attention being distracted,
commences his recitations. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> sit on the floor—the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> on one
side, the women and <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">children</span> on the other. First he repeats the
three-refuge formula (p. 78) and the five prohibitions (p. 126), the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> repeating after him. Next he recites some favourite <span class="t28 hoverable">passage</span> from
the discourses of Buddha, the one generally selected being the
Nidhi-ka??a Sutta (see p. 129). If any listener interposes a remark, or
hints that he does not understand, the priest explains the meaning. The
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> then make obeisance and depart.

The monk-priest next repeats to himself the appointed Pirit for the
first <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> of Vassa—namely, the Ma?gala-sutta, Ratna-sutta, and
Kara?iya-metta-sutta (see p. 318), after which he retires to rest for a
few hours. Rising before daybreak, he meditates on the virtues of
Buddha, on goodwill towards all living beings, on the impurities of the
body, and on death, walking up and down in his own chamber, or in any
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> suitable for perambulation. Next he goes to the temporary chapel,
and prostrating himself before the shrine, says, ‘I <span class="t0 t5 t11 hoverable">worship</span> continually
all the relic-shrines, the sacred Bodhi-tree, and the images of Buddha.
I reverence the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> jewels’ (see p. 175). He then arranges his
<span class="t6 hoverable">offering</span> of flowers, and places these with a small portion of his
morning meal on the altar. His meal being concluded, he teaches the
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">children</span> of the villagers, or he prepares for the mid-day and evening
preaching (ba?a).

These preachings are generally <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> attended, especially on the four
Poya <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">days</span> (p. 257). On the new-moon and full-moon days, the priest must
go to the nearest monastery and join in the Patimokkha (see p. 84); and
on the full-moon day, which terminates the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> months of Vassa, he
must go there again as before, but on that occasion, addressing the
assembled monks, he must say:—‘Venerable Sirs, I have duly finished the
Vassa; if you have any doubt about it, speak, and tell me in what I have
erred.’ If no one speaks he is held to have fulfilled his duties
faultlessly. Then returning and taking with him a <span class="t0 t2 t5 t13 t14 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">second</span> priest, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span>
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> perform the Ratri-ba?a or mid-night service, which concludes
the ceremonies of Vassa. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Two</span> pulpits, made of four upright posts,
supporting small platforms, are erected, and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> from the
neighbouring villages, dressed in their holiday attire, attend in large
numbers. These nocturnal recitations are commonly continued for about
five hours.

Some <span class="t1 t11 t12 t13 t16 t18 t21 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> should next be given of the ceremony <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Pirit, which is
performed in Ceylon and Burma during Vassa, and also at other times. The
name Pirit is corrupted from the Pali _paritta_, which again is supposed
to be connected with Sansk?it paritra or paritra?a, ‘protection[140].’
We must premise that this ceremony had its origin in the <span class="t9 t19 hoverable">fear</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span>
spirits and demons everywhere prevalent in the East (see p. 218); but it
must be borne in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> that Buddhism recognizes no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">order</span> of beings,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> demons, created by God, and eternally separate in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> from
men.

Demons are <span class="t0 t1 t15 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> who are regarded as created by men, rather than by
God; for they may have been <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> in their last <span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> of existence and may
become <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> again (see p. 122). They are, however, represented as
cherishing spiteful and malevolent feelings against the superior race to
which they once belonged; and all kinds of safeguards and counteracting
influences are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> to be needed to protect <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t0 t1 t15 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> from their
malignity.

This is quite in keeping with the Hindu theory, which holds that when a
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> addicted to any particular vice dies, his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> never dies,
but assumes another personality and lives after him as a demon. And this
applies equally to women, so that the resulting demons may be of either
sex, and the female is held to be more spiteful than the male.

The most effective of all safeguards against the machinations of such
malignant beings, is believed to be the recitation or intoning of the
Buddha’s Law, and especially of the Sutta (Sutra) division of it already
described (p. 62). And of this division there are choice
portions—twenty-nine in number[141]—supposed to possess greater
prophylactic potency than other portions. Collectively, they constitute
what is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the Pirit, and of these, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> are most commonly
recited:—the Ma?gala-sutta, the Ratna-sutta, and the
Kara?iya-metta-sutta. Part of the first of these has been already given
(at p. 129 of this volume).

Part of the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t13 t14 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">second</span> or ‘Jewel’ Sutta (translated by Childers) runs thus:—

  ‘All spirits here assembled,—those of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> and those of air,—let all
  such be joyful; let them listen attentively to my words.

  ‘Therefore hear me, O ye spirits; be friendly to the race of men; for

  watch over them.

  before the Monkhood.’

Part of the <span class="t26 hoverable">third</span> or Kara?iya-metta-sutta runs as follows:—

  This is what should be done by him who is <span class="t5 t8 hoverable">wise</span> in seeking his own
  good. Contented and cheerful, not oppressed with the cares of this
  world, not burdened with riches, tranquil, discreet, not arrogant, not
  greedy for gifts, let him not do any mean action for which others who
  are <span class="t5 t8 hoverable">wise</span> might reprove him. Let all creatures be happy and prosperous;
  let them be of joyful mind. Let no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> in any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> deceive another,
  nor let him be harsh towards any one; let him not, out of anger or
  resentment, wish ill to his neighbour. As a mother, so <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> as she

The Rev. D. J. Gogerley witnessed the performance of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Pirit
ceremony in Ceylon (Hardy’s Monachism, p. 240). Taking his <span class="t1 t11 t12 t13 t16 t18 t21 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> and
that of Mr. Dickson, I have compiled the following brief description of
the Maha-ba?a Pirit, ‘great Pirit recitation’:—

So soon as the <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t21 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">sun</span> has <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> crowds of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> arrive at the
Recitation-Hall, bringing oil-lamps made out of cocoanut-shells. The
Hall is decorated, and a canopy, shaped like a pagoda, is erected over
the pulpits, which are placed on a raised platform. When darkness
supervenes a blaze of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> illuminates the Hall. A relic of the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span>
is deposited on the platform, and a sacred thread is fastened round the
Hall, one extremity of it being <span class="t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> close to the relic and to the
Reciters. On the morning of the next day, the recitations begin. One of
the Reciters repeats the three-refuge formula, and the five commandments
(see pp. 78, 126). Then incense is burnt round the platform, and the
musicians outside the Hall strike up a lively air. Next, the formula of
‘the twelve successive causes of existence’ (see p. 102) is intoned, and
a hymn of victory chanted.

The recitation of the Pirit continues uninterruptedly, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> and night,
for seven days. Twenty-four priests are employed, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> of whom are
constantly seated on the platform and engaged in reciting. Moreover
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> times in each day—at sunrise, mid-day, and sunset—they all
assemble <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> and chant in chorus. Of course, when the recitation of
the Suttas constituting the Pirit is concluded, it is recommenced, and
in this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> all the Suttas are recited again and again. On the morning
of the seventh <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> a messenger is sent to a neighbouring temple to
invite the attendance of the gods. Then by a stretch of the imagination
certain of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> and spirits are believed to answer the summons, and
on their supposed arrival, the protective Suttas are chanted more
energetically than ever till the morning of the eighth day, when a
benediction concludes the ceremony, and offerings of robes are made to
the priest-reciters.

We now <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t11 t12 t19 t22 hoverable">pass</span> on to Tibet and Mongolia.

The ceremonies of admission to the monkhood in those countries do not
deviate sufficiently from the practices just described to require
special notice.

With regard, however, to the dress of Lamistic monks after their
admission to the Order, the <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> rule, as we have seen, obliged them
to wear only <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> garments of a dirty yellowish colour, made out of
rags, or picked up in cemeteries or on dust heaps. But the necessities
of a colder climate have compelled the Lamas to increase their official
vestments, and the <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> Lamas sometimes wear bright silken robes
enriched with ornament. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">law</span> is sufficiently obeyed by putting a
patch or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> at one corner.

A <span class="t10 t16 hoverable">full</span> equipment is supposed to consist of an under vestment, a sort of
tunic worn over it, a mantle, a <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of scarf worn over the <span class="t1 t7 t12 t29 hoverable">left</span>
shoulder, a loose robe <span class="t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> round over the same shoulder, and a
cap[142]. The right shoulder is rarely bare, as it generally is in
Southern Buddhist countries.

The colour of these six articles of clothing, especially of the cap, is
yellow or red, according to the sect to which a monk belongs.

The cap is an important mark of sectarian difference, and is of various
forms, and when it has five points, has been compared to a bishop’s
mitre, but the five points really denote the five Dhyani-Buddhas and
their Bodhi-sattvas.

Part of every <span class="t10 t16 hoverable">full</span> monk’s equipment in Tibet is a peculiar instrument,
made of bronze or other metal, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> a Dorje (Sansk?it Vajra, ‘a
thunderbolt’), the employment of which for religious objects is peculiar
to Northern Buddhism. It is shaped like the imaginary thunderbolt of the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> Indra and ?iva—that is, it consists of a short bar, about four
inches long, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> extremities of which swell out in globular form, or
like small oval cages formed of hoops of metal. The original Dorje is
supposed to have fallen direct from Indra’s heaven, and to have been
preserved in a monastery near Lhassa, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Sera pp. 278, 442.
According to another legend, the original instrument belonged to Gautama
<span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> himself, and on his passing away into non-existence, transported
itself through the air from India into Tibet. The consecrated imitations
of it are innumerable. Their primary <span class="t1 hoverable">use</span> is for exorcising and driving
away <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> spirits, especially in the performance of ceremonies and
repetition of prayers—the instrument being then held between the fingers
and thumb and waved backwards and forwards, or from side to side.

The efficacy of the Dorje in securing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> fortune and warding off <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span>
influences of all kinds is supposed to be of wide application. The <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span>
was really borrowed from ?aivism or from the Tantra system, introduced
through Nepal by the Red sect. It is easy to understand the enormous
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> supposed to belong to a priesthood which claimed to be the
wielders of a formidable thunderbolt, sent to them directly from heaven.

No wonder that the original Dorje preserved at the Sera monastery has
become an <span class="t24 t25 hoverable">object</span> of actual worship. According to M. Huc, countless
pilgrims prostrate themselves before it; and at the New Year’s festival,
on the 27th <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> of the first month, it is carried in procession with
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> pomp to Lhassa,—to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> centres of Lamism—Potala and La brang.
On its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> there, the mystical implement is adored by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span>
population, male and female (ii. 221).

Below is an engraving of a Dorje which I <span class="t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> from Darjiling.

[Illustration: ]

It should be mentioned that the fierce Bodhi-sattva Vajra-pa?i (see p.
201 of this volume) is represented holding a similar Dorje in his right
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> in his character of subduer of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> spirits. In some
representations the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> demons are denoted by serpents.

Another important part of a <span class="t10 t16 hoverable">full</span> monk’s equipment in Tibet is the
Prayer-bell (called Drilbu) employed at the performance of daily
religious ceremonies, and rung to accompany the repetition and chanting
of prayers, or to fill up the intervals of worship. It often has half a
Dorje as a handle, or the handle is ornamented with various mystical
symbols carved on it. The <span class="t24 t25 hoverable">object</span> of ringing bells during <span class="t0 t5 t11 hoverable">worship</span> is to
<span class="t8 t13 t21 hoverable">call</span> the attention of the <span class="t0 t1 t15 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> who are worshipped, or to keep off <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span>
spirits by combining noise with the waving of the Dorje in the handle.

The bell here represented was <span class="t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> by me from Darjiling.

[Illustration: ]

The bells <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">used</span> in Burma are described at p. 526.

Other religious implements <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">used</span> by novices and lay-brethren, as <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as
by <span class="t10 t16 hoverable">full</span> monks, are prayer-wheels, prayer-cylinders, rosaries, amulets
(see p. 358), drums (see p. 385), and the Phurbu or Phur-pa (pp. 351,
352).

As to the daily religious services and ceremonies performed by Monks in
Tibet and Mongolia, these, of course, are far more ritualistic than in
southern Buddhist countries. It has already been explained (at pp. 202,
225) that certain abstract essences or mystical forms of the Buddha,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Dhyani-Buddhas, were imagined to exist, and these had their
concrete energizing vice-gerents <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Bodhi-sattvas—beings who
received adoration as if they were actually gods. In Tibet the
Bodhi-sattva Avalokite?vara, and the canonized reformer Tsong Khapa, and
other supposed saints, became prominent objects of religious worship.
Then, in process of time, a complicated ceremonial was developed, which,
as we shall see (p. 338), has much in common with the ritual of Roman
Catholic Christianity.

The language employed in the religious services of the Lamistic
Hierarchy, <span class="t0 t5 t8 t10 t14 t15 t21 t24 t28 hoverable">whether</span> in Tibet, Mongolia, or in the Lama monasteries of
China and Manchuria, is Tibetan. In fact, Tibetan is to the Lamistic
Church what Latin is to the Romish. It is the sole orthodox language of
religion and religious ceremonial.

According to Koeppen, only one Mongolian Lama-monastery (and that
established at Peking) has the right to perform religious services in
Mongolian instead of in Tibetan[143].

Dr. Edkins, however, states that there is a temple (called Fa-hai-si)
near the hunting-park, in which the Manchu language is employed instead
of Tibetan. (Chinese Buddhism, p. 406.)

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Without</span> doubt the acquisition of some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of the Tibetan language
is incumbent on every Lama. Nevertheless, few, except in Tibet, really
understand it. They simply repeat the usual prayers and formularies
mechanically[144].

It appears that the Lamistic priests assemble <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> times a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> to go
through the prescribed ritual—at sunrise, at mid-day, and at sunset. We
read that, before commencing the service, they enter the temple or hall
of <span class="t0 t5 t11 hoverable">worship</span> in procession and seat themselves on low seats in <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> rows.
These are placed the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> length of the hall, from the entrance-door to
the altar, being divided in the middle by a passage. At the further
extremity, close to the altar, are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> raised thrones for the <span class="t1 t4 t9 t16 hoverable">Head</span>
Lamas—a five-cushioned one on the right for the Abbot and a
three-cushioned one for the Vice-Abbot.

When all have seated themselves, the choir-master or precentor gives a
signal with a bell. Then the prayer-formularies are recited or chanted,
certain passages out of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Law</span> are intoned and certain litanies sung,
sometimes in loud tones, accompanied by noisy music or by clapping of
hands, and generally in unison, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> occasionally verses are sung
alternately with responses.

Then at other times a sentence of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Law</span> is repeated by each monk in
turn; or a chant is <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> up consisting of such <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> as: Praise be to the
Buddha! or praise be to some Bodhi-sattva! followed by a recital of all
his names, titles, and epithets; or mystical sentences and syllables are
ejaculated. The result is said to be a chaos of voices and a deafening
confusion of sounds.

The chief instruments <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">used</span> in the services are a spiral shell, a <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span>
trumpet of copper or brass (sometimes more than ten feet long), a large
drum, flutes, cymbals, and horns—the last being sometimes made of the
thigh-bones of <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> beings[145].

The ritual is imposing, and still more so when a living <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> is
present. It has been described by M. Huc, and I here give the substance
of his account[146].

  In front of the chief idol, and on a level with the altar, is a gilded
  seat for the living <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> or Grand Lama of the Monastery. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span>
  space of the temple, from one end to the other, is occupied by <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span>
  low seats almost level with the ground, stretching right and <span class="t1 t7 t12 t29 hoverable">left</span> of
  the Grand Lama’s throne. These are covered with carpets, a vacant
  space being <span class="t1 t7 t12 t29 hoverable">left</span> between each row for the Lamas to <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t11 t12 t19 t22 hoverable">pass</span> and repass.
  When the hour of prayer is come, a Lama, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> office it is to summon
  the choir, places himself in front of the grand entrance of the temple
  and blows with all the force of his lungs into a conch-shell trumpet,
  the sound of which is audible for a league round. This effectually
  rouses the Lamas and calls them together. Each then takes his mantle
  and official hat of ceremony, and repairs to the interior court. The
  trumpet sounds again, and when its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">note</span> is <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t18 hoverable">heard</span> for the <span class="t26 hoverable">third</span> time,
  the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> door is suddenly thrown open; the living <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> enters, and
  takes his seat in front of the image on the altar. Then the Lamas,
  after depositing their red boots in the vestibule, advance towards him
  barefoot, and adore him by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> prostrations. This done, they seat
  themselves on the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> seats according to their dignity, cross-legged
  and <span class="t3 hoverable">face</span> to face. As soon as the director of the ceremonies has given
  the signal by tinkling a little bell, everyone murmurs the prescribed
  prayers, unrolling the formularies on his knees. After this
  recitation, there is profound silence for a minute. Then the bell is
  again rung, and a hymn or chant in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> choruses begins. The Tibetan
  prayers, ordinarily arranged in verses, and <span class="t2 t11 t15 t19 t25 t27 hoverable">written</span> in metrical style,
  are <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> adapted to harmony; but sometimes at certain pauses indicated
  by the rubric, the Lama musicians execute a strain in little accord
  with the gravity of the psalmody. The result is a stunning noise of
  bells, cymbals, drums, tambourines, conch-shells, trumpets, and pipes.
  Each musician sounds his instrument with a sort of fury, and each
  strives to outdo his neighbour in the noise he can produce. (Huc’s
  Travels, i. 88, abridged.)

One important element in some Tibetan religious services is the
consecration and distribution of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">holy</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> and grain by the chief
Lamas.

Perfumes, too, are burnt, and censers containing incense are swung
backwards and forwards during the ceremonies.

Then, again, some Lamistic ceremonials include the drinking of tea
poured into little cups, kept in the breast-pockets of the monks’ robes,
and replenished <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> times during the service.

Sir Richard Temple (Journal, ii. 208) <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> describes a tea-drinking
ceremonial at which he was present, at the monastery of Pemyangchi in
Sikkim (see p. 298 of these Lectures).

  The priests and monks, some thirty-five in all, were drawn up in <span class="t10 t16 hoverable">full</span>
  robes to receive us. Then the officials of the monastery were
  introduced—the steward, the rod-bearer, the deputy master, and lastly,
  the master. A procession was quickly formed, which we followed into
  the chapel, where they all <span class="t2 t4 t6 t9 t18 t19 t22 hoverable">took</span> their accustomed seats, while we sat
  on places prepared for us. The interior of the chapel seemed an odd
  <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> for this, but we were told that it was the correct ceremonial. A
  chant was begun, which lasted some ten minutes, as a sort of grace,
  and then tea was handed round—first to us, next to the priests, and
  lastly to the monks. A short chant followed, and then the procession
  preceded us out of the chapel.

In the picture which accompanies Sir Richard’s description, all the
monks have head-coverings, some of which are like caps or hats of a <span class="t17 t29 hoverable">high</span>
sugar-loaf shape, while others have several points like episcopal mitres
(see p. 321).

The monks of Sikkim are generally of the Dugpa sect[147], and wear red
caps (see pp. 273, 298).

When Dr. Watt was in Ladak, he was present at a service performed by a
<span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span> of monks belonging to both sects, who seemed to fraternize very
amicably. All the monks of the red sect <span class="t2 t4 t6 t9 t18 t19 t22 hoverable">took</span> up a position on one side
of the chapel, while those of the yellow sect ranged themselves on the
opposite side. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> sects entered together, as usual, in procession,
and part of the ceremonial—as in that witnessed by Sir Richard
Temple—consisted in drinking tea from little cups <span class="t2 t5 t11 t18 t19 t23 t26 hoverable">taken</span> from the folds
of their robes, and put back again, to be again <span class="t2 t5 t11 t18 t19 t23 t26 hoverable">taken</span> out and
replenished; and this, too, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> interrupting the continuous
repetition of prayers, chants, and formularies[148].

M. Huc also describes a ‘Tea-general’ ceremony after morning service in
a temple. Each monk drinks in silence, carefully placing his scarf
before his cup, as if to prevent the sight of the apparent incongruity
of drinking tea in such a sacred spot (ii. 57).

Another instance of tea-drinking as an element in Lamistic ceremonial,
occurs in Mr. Sarat Chandra Das’ highly interesting <span class="t1 t11 t12 t13 t16 t18 t21 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the
ceremony of his presentation to the Dalai Lama at the palace-monastery
of Potala, in Lhassa, on June 10, 1882. I venture to give the substance
of it in an abbreviated <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> and not quite literally[149].

An <span class="t1 t11 t12 t13 t16 t18 t21 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of other presentations both to the Dalai Lama and Tashi Lama
will be given in a future Lecture (see pp. 439, 444, 447).

  Early in the morning I was informed of the arrival of Chola Kusho, who
  was ready to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> me to Potala for presentation to the Dalai Lama. We
  sallied forth on horseback, with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> bundles of incense-sticks in
  our hands, and a roll of scarves in our breast-pockets, chanting as we
  <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> along certain hymns, and particularly the mystic ‘Om ma?i padme
  Hum.’ In the street we saw a calf sucking milk, and several women
  fetching <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> in our direction. My companions were delighted at these
  auspicious omens. Arrived at the eastern gateway of Potala, we
  dismounted, and walked up a <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> hall, on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> sides of which were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span>
  rows of prayer-wheels, put there to be twirled, on going in and coming
  out.

  A young monk now came down to conduct us, and we ascended slowly,
  looking only on the ground before us. The several ladders which
  conducted us from one story to another were steep, and placed in dark
  halls. I counted five, which <span class="t2 t4 t6 t9 t18 t19 t22 hoverable">took</span> us as far as the ground-floor of the
  Red palace. Half-a-dozen ladders still remained to be scaled.

  At about eight we reached the top, and there found a <span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span> of monks
  anxiously awaiting an interview with his Holiness. A seat was pointed
  out to me. A monk sat near me, and smilingly observed that it must
  have been on <span class="t1 t11 t12 t13 t16 t18 t21 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the sins of my former <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> that I was <span class="t9 t24 hoverable">born</span> in
  India, where there is no living Buddha.

  From the top of the Red palace we enjoyed a grand panorama of Lhassa
  and its suburbs. Shortly afterwards some Lamas of <span class="t17 t29 hoverable">high</span> rank, dressed
  in loose yellow mantles, arrived. They entered the hall of reception
  one after another in solemn array. We remained outside in anxious
  suspense, fixing our <span class="t2 t6 t19 t20 t26 t29 hoverable">eyes</span> on the entrance door, and expecting to be
  summoned to his Holiness’ presence.

  At last, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> Lamas came towards us and asked us to enter in a line
  one after another. Walking very gently, we proceeded to the middle of
  the audience hall—a spacious apartment supported by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> rows of four
  wooden pillars. The walls had paintings of the exploits of Buddha, of
  Chanrassig[150], Tsong Khapa, and other celebrated saints, besides
  images of the successive incarnations of the Dalai Lama.

  As soon as we had entered the official scarf-collectors received the
  presentation-scarves from our hands. We seated ourselves on rugs,
  spread in about eight rows, my seat being in the <span class="t26 hoverable">third</span> row, at a
  distance of about ten feet from the Grand Lama’s throne, and a little
  to his left. When all were seated, perfect silence reigned in the
  grand hall. The <span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> officials walked from <span class="t1 t7 t12 t29 hoverable">left</span> to right with serene
  gravity, as became their exalted rank, in the presence of the Supreme
  Vice-Regent of <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> on earth. At their <span class="t1 t4 t9 t16 hoverable">head</span> walked the Kuchar
  Khanpo, who carried in his <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> the bowl of benediction, containing
  the sacred Thui (that is, consecrated <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> stained yellow with
  saffron) for sprinkling over the audience. The bearer of the
  incense-pot, suspended by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> golden chains, the carrier of the
  royal golden tea-pot, and other domestic officials, now came up, and
  stood motionless as pictures, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> looking on either side, but
  fixing their <span class="t2 t6 t19 t20 t26 t29 hoverable">eyes</span> and their attention, as it were, on the tips of
  their respective noses. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Two</span> large golden lamp-burners, resembling
  flower-vases, flickered on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> sides of the throne. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>
  altar—resembling an oriental throne, and supported by lions[151]
  carved in wood—on which sat his Holiness, a child of eight, was
  covered with silk scarves of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> value. It was about four feet high,
  six long, and four broad. A yellow mitre-hat[152] covered the Grand
  Lama’s head, the pendant portions veiling his ears, and a yellow
  mantle enveloped his person. He sat cross-legged, with the palms of
  his <span class="t20 hoverable">hands</span> joined <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> to bless us. When it came to my turn I
  received his Holiness’ benediction, and was able to look <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> his
  <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> face. Other Lamas approached him with downcast looks, and
  resumed their respective seats, not presuming to look up. I longed to
  linger a few seconds, but other candidates for benediction displaced
  me by pushing me gently forward. I noticed that the princely child
  possessed a really bright and fair complexion, with rosy cheeks. His
  <span class="t2 t6 t19 t20 t26 t29 hoverable">eyes</span> were large and penetrating. The contour of his <span class="t3 hoverable">face</span> was
  remarkably Aryan, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> somewhat marred by the obliquity of his eyes.
  The thinness of his <span class="t0 t4 t5 t10 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">person</span> was probably owing to the fatigues of the
  court-ceremonies, religious duties, and ascetic observances, to which
  he had been subjected since taking the vows of monkhood. Remembering
  the stories about the freaks of fortune, which had lately <span class="t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> him
  to this proud position, and had compelled his predecessors to undergo
  untimely transmigrations, I pitied his exalted rank: for who knows
  <span class="t0 t5 t8 t10 t14 t15 t21 t24 t28 hoverable">whether</span> he will not be forced to undergo another transmigration before
  reaching his twentieth year?

  When all were again seated after receiving the Dalai Lama’s
  benediction, the Sol-pon Chhenpo poured tea in his Holiness’ golden
  cup from a golden tea-pot, while four assistant Sol-pons poured tea in
  the cups of the audience, consisting of the <span class="t1 t4 t9 t16 hoverable">head</span> Lamas of Meru
  monastery and ourselves. Before the Grand Lama lifted his cup to his
  lips, a grace was solemnly said, beginning with ‘Om ah Hum’ thrice
  chanted, and followed by a prayer to the following effect:—‘Never even
  for a moment losing sight of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> Holies, always offer reverence
  to the Tri-ratnas; let the blessings of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> us.’ <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Without</span>
  even stirring the air by the movements of our limbs, we slowly lifted
  our cups to our lips, and drank the tea—which was delicious—taking
  care to make no sound with our lips. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Three</span> times was tea served, and
  <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> times we emptied our cups, after which we put them back in our
  breast-pockets. Then the Sol-pon placed a golden dish <span class="t10 t16 hoverable">full</span> of
  consecrated rice in front of his Holiness, which he only touched. The
  remainder was distributed among those present. I obtained a handful,
  which I carefully tied in one corner of my handkerchief. The following
  grace was then uttered by the assembled monks, with much gravity:—‘The
  most precious _Buddha_ is the most perfect and matchless teacher; the
  most unerring guide is the _Sa?gha_; the most infallible protection is
  in the sacred _Dharma_. We offer these offerings to these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span>
  objects of refuge. Reverence be to each of them!’

Mr. Sarat Chandra Das also witnessed at the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> the performance of
a remarkable ceremony for the translation of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> of a chief Lama or
Khanpo to one of the heavenly mansions.

It appears that a certain well-known Khanpo had died of small-pox. He
was one of the most distinguished scholars of Tibet, and held the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t22 t23 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">highest</span> position in the Court of Potala. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> on which the ceremony
was performed was the twenty-seventh <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> of this chief Lama’s _Bardo_
(p. 371); that is, of the interval of forty-nine <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">days</span> between his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span>
and his translation to another world. (According to Jäschke the interval
of the intermediate <span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> only lasts for forty days.)

The Dalai Lama, seated on his throne, chanted a hymn in a low indistinct
voice. Afterwards the assembled monks in grave tones repeated what the
Grand Lama had uttered. Then a venerable personage rose from the middle
of the first row of seats, and addressing the Grand Lama as the
incarnate <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> Chenressig (Avalokite?vara), recited all the many acts of
mercy performed by him, as the patron-saint of Tibet, for the benefit of
its people. Next, he made offerings of certain precious <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span>
(including an imaginary presentation of the seven mythical
treasures[153]) for the benefit of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> of the late Khanpo,
saying:—‘I pray that you may graciously accept these presents for the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> of all living beings.’

Finally, he prostrated himself <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> times before the Grand Lama’s
throne. A solemn pause followed; after which the audience rose, and the
Grand Lama retired. Mr. Sarat Chandra Das goes on to relate that at the
end of the ceremony one of the assistant Lamas gave him <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> packets of
pills, and another tied a scrap of red silk round his neck. The pills,
he was told, were chinlab or blessings, consecrated by the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> and
other saints; and the consecrated scrap of silk, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> sungdu, ‘knot of
blessing,’ was the Grand Lama’s usual return for presents made to him by
pilgrims and devotees.

We may <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">note</span> here that in 1866 the Indian explorer Nain Singh saw the
then Dalai Lama. He was a handsome boy about thirteen <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> old, and was
seated on a throne six feet high. He had the Regent on his right hand.
He was said to be in his thirteenth transmigration[154].

Dr. Schlagintweit (p. 239) describes a ceremony in which consecrated
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> (thui) is poured from a teapot-like vessel over a metallic mirror
(pp. 458, 463 of these Lectures), which is held so as to reflect the
image of Gautama <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> seated on the altar. This <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> falls down into
a flat vessel containing a bag filled with rice, and is then suitable
for ceremonial ablutions.

Another ceremony (called Nyungne? by Schlagintweit), involving <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span>
abstinence, lasts for four days.

The first and <span class="t0 t2 t5 t13 t14 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">second</span> <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">days</span> are passed in preparations. Those who are to
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> part in the ceremony rise at sunrise, bathe and prostrate
themselves several times before the image of Avalokite?vara. The <span class="t1 t4 t9 t16 hoverable">head</span>
Lama then bids them confess their faults, and meditate on the evils
resulting from demerit. He next, with his attendants, recites extracts
from certain books of confession. This goes on till ten o’clock, when
tea is taken. After this the recitations and prayer-recitals continue
till <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> o’clock, when a meal of vegetables is eaten. Then comes a
pause, but the prayers and readings are afterwards carried on till late
at night, tea being handed round at intervals. Before retiring to rest,
the <span class="t1 t4 t9 t16 hoverable">head</span> Lama specifies the various duties to be performed by the
devotees on the following day, and orders them, as a penance, to sleep
in ‘the lion-posture,’ viz. to lie on the right side, to stretch out the
feet and to support the <span class="t1 t4 t9 t16 hoverable">head</span> with the right hand[155].

The <span class="t26 hoverable">third</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> is the most important, and is passed in rigorous
abstinence from all food. No one is even allowed to swallow his saliva,
which must be ejected into a vessel placed before him. Not a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> must
be spoken. Each <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> prays and confesses his sins, but does so in
absolute silence. This continues till sunrise on the fourth day.

It was at first the rule that repetitions of the Law, confessions of <span class="t2 t5 t8 t17 t18 t19 hoverable">sin</span>
(especially the Patimokkha), and some of the chief religious ceremonies
(including fasting) should <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> place, more particularly on the <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">days</span> of
new and <span class="t10 t16 hoverable">full</span> moon (called Uposatha, p. 84).

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> we read that ‘on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> of <span class="t10 t16 hoverable">full</span> moon Ananda purified himself, and
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> up to the upper story of his <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> to keep the sacred day’
(Mahasudassana-sutra, 1-10). This was in conformity with the <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span>
Brahmanical rule that every new-moon <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> (Dar?a) and every full-moon <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span>
(Paur?amasa) should be <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> apart for special religious observances[156].

In later times the intermediate quarter-moon <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">days</span> were also held sacred,
and so the <span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span> of Uposatha <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">days</span> (see p. 84) was increased to four in
every month, or once a week. Very strict Buddhists in Tibet <span class="t6 hoverable">eat</span> nothing
on these <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">days</span> between sunrise and sunset except farinaceous <span class="t0 t14 t23 t24 hoverable">food</span> with
tea (p. 346).

The laity are invited to join in keeping the Uposatha days, but <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> no
real part in the detail of the services. The same rule applies to all
religious ceremonies. Laymen may be present at any rite, but <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span>
co-operating in carrying out the ritual. Still, laymen have their own
part to perform. They look on—listen, tell their rosaries, and repeat
short prayers—such as the ‘three-refuge’ and ‘jewel-lotus’ formula (pp.
78, 370)—and make declarations to avoid the five <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> sins (p. 126). Or
they walk up to the image-altar and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> offerings on it, or bow before
it and receive the Lama’s benediction. Theoretically, the laity only
exist to honour and support the monkhood, and to be <span class="t2 t15 t24 hoverable">blessed</span> by them in
return. At all events a layman’s religion is usually restricted to a
very limited range of duty.

One common <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> of showing piety is by walking round temples,
monasteries, Stupas, and sacred walls (see pp. 380, 505), from east to
west, keeping the right shoulder towards them, and even occasionally
measuring the ground with the extended body.

This last task is by no means a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> or easy one. According to M. Huc
(i. 202), a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> scarcely suffices to perform the circumambulation
when the monastic buildings and temples occupy an extensive area. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">People</span>
begin at daybreak, and the feat must be accomplished all at one time,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> any break, or even a few moments’ pause for taking nourishment.
Moreover, the measuring-process must be perfect; ‘the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> must be
extended to its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> length, and the forehead must touch the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span>
while the arms are stretched out in front and the <span class="t20 hoverable">hands</span> joined.’ At each
prostration a circle must be drawn on the ground with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> rams’ horns
held in the hands. ‘It is a sorrowful spectacle, and the unfortunate

utmost severity of the weather does not present any obstacle to their
courageous devotion. They continue their prostrations through rain,
snow, and cold. Sometimes they go through the additional penance of
carrying an enormous weight of books on their backs. You meet with men,
women, and even <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">children</span> sinking under these excessive burdens. When
they have finished their circumambulation, they are considered to have
acquired the same merit as if they had recited all the prayers contained
in the books they have carried.’ In point of <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> they are generally far
too ignorant to be able to read the books, and the carrying of them on
their backs is <span class="t2 t5 t11 t18 t19 t23 t26 hoverable">taken</span> as an adequate equivalent.

The acquisition of merit by circumambulation is not an exclusively Hindu
or Buddhist idea.

Indeed, we may fitly conclude the present Lecture by a comparison
between the ritual of Tibetan Buddhism and that of Roman Catholicism—a
comparison, too, drawn by the Roman Catholic Missionaries themselves:

‘The cross, the mitre, the dalmatica, the cope, which Grand Lamas wear
on their journeys, or when they are performing some ceremony out of the
temple; the service with double choirs, the psalmody, the exorcisms, the
censer for incense, suspended from five chains, and opened or closed at
pleasure; the benedictions pronounced by the Lamas by extending the
right <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> over the heads of the faithful; the chaplet, ecclesiastical
celibacy, <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> retirement, the <span class="t0 t5 t11 hoverable">worship</span> of the saints, the fasts,
the processions, the litanies, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">holy</span> water, all these are analogies
between the Buddhists and ourselves’ (Huc, ii. 50). To these may be
added sacred images, sacred pictures, sacred symbols, relics, lamps, and
illuminations[157].

This is doubtless a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> comparison. But it does not follow that the
opinion which the missionaries express—‘that these analogies are of
Christian origin’—is equally deserving of our assent. No doubt one chief
feature of Buddhism, as of Hinduism[158], is its receptivity, but may it
not be the <span class="t5 t16 t21 t24 t25 hoverable">case</span> that <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> tendencies will be found to
assert themselves independently in every part of the world, wherever
surrounding circumstances are favourable to their development?




                             LECTURE XIII.
        _Festivals, Domestic Rites, and Formularies of Prayer._


We must now turn to the consideration of some of the chief festivals,
domestic rites, and prayer-formularies of Buddhism—a subject which
follows as a natural sequel to the last Lecture.

It is <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> known that the Hindus have certain festivals and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">holy</span> days,
celebrated at the junction of the seasons which in India are properly
six in number—namely, spring, summer, the rains (Varsha), autumn,
winter, and the season of dew and mist (see ‘Indian Wisdom,’ p. 450;
‘Brahmanism and Hinduism,’ p. 428).

Buddhism has adopted the old Hindu ideas on this subject, and has added
others of its own, but generally only reckons <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> seasons—summer, the
rains (Vassa = Varsha) and winter.

The festival of the New Year is, of course, universal. It is supposed to
celebrate the victory of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> over darkness, and, in Buddhist
countries, of Buddhism over ignorance. The corresponding Hindu festival
is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Makara-sa?kranti. In India this marks the termination of the
inauspicious month Pausha and the beginning of the sun’s northern course
(uttaraya?a) in the heavens. It is a season of general rejoicing.

In Burma, where a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> type of Southern Buddhism is still to be found,
the New Year’s festival might suitably be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> a ‘water-festival.’ It
has there so little connexion with the increase of the New Year’s light,
that it often takes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> as late as the early half of April (see Mr.
Scott’s ‘Burman,’ ii. 48). It is, however, a movable feast, the date of
which is regularly fixed by the astrologers of Mandalay, ‘who make
intricate calculations based on the position of various constellations.’
The <span class="t24 t25 hoverable">object</span> is to determine on what precise <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> of the Naths
(see p. 217 of this volume) will descend <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> and inaugurate
the new year. When the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> arrives all are on the watch, and just at the
right moment—which invariably occurs at midnight—a cannon is fired off,
announcing the descent of the Nath-king <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> earth. Forthwith (according
to Mr. Scott) <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> and women sally out of their houses, carrying pots
<span class="t10 t16 hoverable">full</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> consecrated by fresh leaves and twigs of a sacred tree (p.
514 of this volume), repeat a formal prayer, and pour out the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> on
the ground. At the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> all who have guns of any <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> discharge
them, so as to greet the new year with as much noise as possible.

Then, ‘with the first glimmer of light,’ all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> jars <span class="t10 t16 hoverable">full</span> of fresh
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> and carry them off to the nearest monastery. First they present
them to the monks, and then proceed to bathe the images. This <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> is
usually done by the women of the party, ‘who reverently clamber up’ and
empty their goblets of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> over the placid features of the Buddhas and
Bodhi-sattvas. Then begin the Saturnalia. All along the road are urchins
with squirts and syringes, with which they have been furtively
practising for the last few days. The skill <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> acquired is exhibited
by the accuracy of their aim. Cold streams of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> catch the ears of
the passers by. Young <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> and girls salute one another with the contents
of jars and goblets. Shouts of merriment are <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t18 hoverable">heard</span> in every quarter.
Before breakfast every one is soaked, but no one thinks of changing his
garments, for the weather is warm, and ‘water is everywhere.’ The girls
are the most enthusiastic, and as they generally go in bands and carry
copious reservoirs along with them, ‘unprotected males’ are soon routed.
Then a <span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span> of ‘zealous people’ go down to the river, wade into the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> knee-deep, splash about and drench one another till they are
tired. No one escapes. For <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">days</span> no one likes to be seen with dry
clothes. The wetting is a compliment. A clerk comes up to his master,
bows, and ‘gravely pours the contents of a silver cup down the back of
his neck,’ saying, ‘let me do homage to you with water.’

It appears from Mr. Scott’s amusing narrative that, when there was a
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> in Burma, an important feature of the festival was the formal
washing of his Majesty’s head.

The New Year’s rejoicings in Ceylon require no special notice.

In Tibet the New Year’s festival properly begins at new moon, and may be
delayed till some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> in February. The festival lasts fifteen days,
and, as usual, is a season of general festivity, gifts, congratulations,
mummery, dancing, and acting. It is the Lamistic carnival.

According to M. Huc (ii. 216) the rejoicings commence (as in Burma) at
midnight. At Lhassa all the inhabitants sit up, awaiting the solemn
moment which is to close the old year and open the new. The usages
differ so curiously from those customary in Southern Buddhist countries,
that I here give an abbreviated version of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> French travellers’
experiences.

  Not being at all eager to watch for the moment of separation between
  the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> Tibetan years, we <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> to bed at our usual hour, and were
  wrapped in profound slumber, when we were suddenly awakened by cries
  of joy issuing from all quarters of the town. Bells, cymbals, conchs,
  tambourines, and all the instruments of Tibetan music, were <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> to
  <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> and produced the most frightful uproar imaginable. We
  had a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> to get up to witness the happiness of the inhabitants
  of Lhassa, but the cold was so cutting that, after reflection, we
  decided to remain under our woollen coverlets, and to unite ourselves
  in <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">heart</span> only with the public felicity. Unhappily for our comfort,
  violent knocks on our door, threatening to smash it into splinters,
  warned us that we must renounce our project. We <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> donned our
  clothes, and the door being opened, some friendly Tibetans rushed into
  our room, inviting us to the New Year’s banquet. They all bore in
  their <span class="t20 hoverable">hands</span> a small vessel made of baked earth, in which balls of
  honey and flour floated on boiling water. One visitor offered us a
  <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> silver needle, terminating in a hook, and invited us to fish in
  his basin. At first we sought to excuse ourselves, objecting that we
  were not in the habit of taking <span class="t0 t14 t23 t24 hoverable">food</span> during the night, but they
  entreated us so warmly, and put out their tongues at us with so
  friendly a grace, that we were obliged to comply, and resign ourselves
  to a participation in the New Year’s festivities. Each of us,
  therefore, hooked a ball, which we then crushed between our teeth to
  ascertain its flavour. For politeness sake we had to swallow the dose,
  but not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> making some grimaces. Nor could we get off with this
  first act of devotion. The New Year was inexorable. Our numerous
  friends at Lhassa succeeded each other almost <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> interruption,
  and we had perforce to munch Tibetan sweetmeats till daybreak.

It is said that other peculiar customs follow, one of which the Tibetans
<span class="t8 t13 t21 hoverable">call</span> the Lhassa-Moru. This takes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> on the <span class="t26 hoverable">third</span> day, and leads to
the invasion of the town and its environs by innumerable bands of Lamas.
Immense numbers of Lamas, some on foot, some on horseback, some on asses
or oxen, and all carrying cooking-utensils and prayer-books, crowd into
Lhassa from all points. The town is completely over-run. Those who
cannot get lodgings encamp in the streets and squares, or pitch their
tents in the suburbs. The tribunals are closed, and the course of
justice is suspended. The Lamas parade the streets in disorderly bands,
uttering discordant cries, pushing one another about, quarrelling,
fighting, and yet, in the midst of all, chanting their prayers (Huc, ii.
218).

In Tibet there is a ‘water-festival’ in the seventh or eighth month
(about our August and September). At this festival the Lamas go in
procession to rivers and lakes, and consecrate the waters by benediction
or by throwing in offerings. Huts and tents are erected on the banks,
and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> bathe and drink to wash away their sins. It concludes with
dancing, buffoonery, and masquerading.

The festival of Gautama Buddha’s conception, or of the Buddha’s _last_
birth—for it must be borne in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> that, before Buddhahood, he <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span>
through innumerable previous births—is a most important anniversary in
all Buddhist countries, but the right date has been the occasion of much
controversy. The event is generally celebrated at the end of April, or
beginning of May, or on a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> corresponding to the 15th <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> of the Hindu
month Vai?akha, which is also sometimes given as the date of the
Buddha’s attainment of Buddhahood, and of his death. Everywhere
throughout the modern Buddhist <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> the Buddha’s birthday is kept by
the <span class="t0 t5 t11 hoverable">worship</span> of his images, followed by processions.

As to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> of his death, Sarat Chandra Das was at Lhassa on June 1,

anniversary of Buddha’s Nirva?a—the burning of incense in every shrine,
chapel, monastery, and house, darkened the atmosphere with smoke. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Men</span>

his blessing.’

The ‘festival of lamps’ is an important anniversary with all Buddhists.
The Hindus have their Divali or feast of illuminations (see ‘Brahmanism
and Hinduism,’ p. 432) when the cold season begins. The early Buddhists
marked the end of the rainy season (Vassa = Varsha), which terminated
their period of retirement, by a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> of rejoicing (see p. 84). In
process of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> they connected the celebration of Gautama’s descent from
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heaven</span> (p. 417) with the termination of Vassa.

In Tibet the orthodox followers of the Dalai Lama have a festival of
their own, with illuminations, on the 25th <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> of the 10th month
(Nov.—Dec.), to celebrate the ascension of Tsong Khapa to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heaven</span> (p.
280). Sarat Chandra Das was at Tashi Lunpo on this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> in 1881, when
‘hundreds of lamp-burners were tastefully placed in rows on the roof of
every building.’ The illuminations of the temples, tombs, and grand
monastery ‘presented a magnificent appearance.’

With regard to the season <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Vassa, it should be noted here that
since there is no rainy period of the year in Tibet which corresponds to
the Indian ‘Rains,’ certain seasons of abstinence from <span class="t0 t14 t23 t24 hoverable">food</span> are observed
either before, or at the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> with the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Festivals. These
periods of fasting are distributed equally throughout the year—one in
February, one in May, one in July, one in November or December.

The festivals and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">holy</span> <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">days</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> briefly described, are by no means the
only festivals of Buddhism. There are numerous other special and local
ones. For example, in Ceylon, the Sinhalese celebrate the coming of the
<span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> to their island and his victory over the Rakshasas and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span>
demons by a festival in March or April, when the greater <span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span> of
pilgrims flock to his supposed foot-print on Adam’s Peak, or to the
sacred Bodhi-tree at Anuradha-pura (see p. 519). Other Southern
countries have festivals connected with the <span class="t0 t5 t11 hoverable">worship</span> of special
foot-prints and relics of their own.

Then the Lamas in Lhassa keep the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> of the <span class="t0 t5 t11 hoverable">worship</span> of the Dorje (see
p. 322) on the 27th <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> of the first month, while those in Sikkim
celebrate as a festival the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> on which the Lepchas make offerings to
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> of the mountain Kinchinjunga.

Then, again, at the beginning of the <span class="t26 hoverable">third</span> month an exhibition of sacred
vessels and pictures takes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> at Lhassa, accompanied by processions
in masks, the Lamas appearing as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> genii, and the laity as tigers,
leopards, elephants, &c.

In other places, too, there are special festivals. For example, a
singular festival, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> ‘Chase of the spirit-kings,’ is kept by
Northern Buddhists on the 30th of the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t13 t14 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">second</span> month, when there is a vast
amount of religious dancing (with tediously slow movements),
masquerading, mummery, and buffoonery, not unlike the devil-dancing
which goes on in Ceylon, and closely connected with the universal belief
in demons and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> spirits.

The most hideous masks are <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">used</span> on these occasions. In 1884 I had an
opportunity of inspecting in a Buddhist monastery near Darjiling a most
singular assortment of religious masks, which for distortion of feature
and horrible unsightliness, could scarcely be matched anywhere; for
indeed mask-making is an <span class="t1 t3 t4 t7 t8 t14 t15 t16 t17 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">art</span> which Buddhism has <span class="t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> to the greatest
perfection. I also witnessed a religious dance performed by a party of
masqueraders which struck me as a remarkable example of the utter
debasement of Buddhism in Northern countries.

Mrs. Bridges describes a similar religious dance in Ladak thus:—

  ‘A group of grinning masks—lions’ heads and harlequins’ bodies—came
  down the steps, and whirling slowly round, retreated again into the
  gloom and came out dragon-headed. Then a band of skeletons, the skulls
  (masks) admirably painted, gnashing their hideous jaws and shaking
  their lanky limbs, rushed out into the sunshine and executed a real
  “Dance of Death” before us.’ (‘Travels,’ p. 101.)

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> Buddhists are prohibited from dancing and masquerading (p.
126 of this volume); just as Manu (II. 178, IV. 15, 212) prohibited
Brahmans from engaging in similar frivolities.

Then the religious dramas performed on some of the Buddhist festive <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">days</span>
are not the least interesting examples of the present prevalent
superstitions.

I witnessed part of a dramatic performance at a Burmese Theatre in
Calcutta (during the Exhibition year), when the story of the Hindu Epic,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Ramaya?a, and especially that portion of it which relates to the
carrying off of Sita by demons (see ‘Brahmanism and Hinduism,’ p. 42,
and ‘Indian Wisdom,’ p. 337), was dramatically represented. The theatre
was a rude wooden enclosure open to the sky, with the exception of a
portion roofed over for a band of musicians, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> noisy performances
appeared to constitute an important element in the proceedings. The
chief musician sat on the ground in the middle of a circular
frame-work—about <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> feet high—hung round with drums of
different sizes, which he struck with his hands, and occasionally tuned
by the application of moist clay in larger or smaller lumps. In the
centre of the open area of flat dusty soil which served for the stage, a
big branch of a tree was stuck upright, possibly to represent the forest
in which Rama lived with his wife. Then the hero and heroine of the
drama—Rama and Sita—kept up a tedious colloquy, interspersed with jokes,
for hours. The former—who, be it remembered, was supposed to be a
god—smoked a cigar all the while, and occasionally ejected saliva with
perfect indifference to all appearances and to all laws of congruity,
while every now and again Sita, in spite of a tight dress, varied the
monotony of the dialogue by executing a slow dance, characterized by
strange contortions, twistings, and wrigglings of the limbs. Hideous
masks were at intervals assumed by the actors, and, of course, by the
demons who intervened at odd moments with much ludicrous gesticulation.
The action of the play <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> on continuously for about ten days, during
which period <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> came and <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> as they liked, and the last comers
entered into the progress of the plot with as much interest as if they
had witnessed the whole. There is never much originality of invention in
these religious plays. The Indian heroic poems and the five hundred and
fifty birth-stories (see p. 63) of the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> furnish the basis of all.

The religious dramas of Tibet are of a somewhat different character. The
following description is founded on Dr. Schlagintweit’s <span class="t1 t11 t12 t13 t16 t18 t21 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> (p.
233), and on that of Mrs. Bridges in her interesting ‘Travels’ (John
Murray, 1883, p. 130).

  The dramatis personæ consist of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> classes.—1. Tutelary deities or
  <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> genii, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Dragshed (Drag?ed), who ward off the assaults of
  <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> demons; 2. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Evil</span> demons; 3. Men. The actors of each class are
  distinguished by their masks. The first class—that is the Dragsheds or
  <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> genii—wear masks of enormous size and terrific aspect[159]. The
  <span class="t0 t2 t5 t13 t14 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">second</span> class—that is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Evil</span> demons—wear larger masks of a dark
  colour, and their garments are <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> padded to deaden the force of the
  blows showered <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> them. The <span class="t26 hoverable">third</span> class—that is the Men—wear the
  usual dress of <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> beings, and masks of a natural size and colour,
  while under their clothes they carry heavy wooden sticks, with which
  at times, during the progress of the drama, they belabour the demons.
  The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> also get <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> knocked about by the demons, much to the
  amusement of the spectators.

  The drama is preceded by the recital of hymns and prayers and by noisy
  music. The Dragsheds occupy the centre, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> are on their right and
  the demons on their left. At short intervals the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> and the demons
  execute slow dances, each group by itself. At last, an <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> and

  an unusually large yellow mask, advances against them surrounded by
  about a dozen followers. Other Dragsheds next rush out from the
  back-ground, shoot arrows, throw stones, and even <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> with muskets

  all the actors (men and demons included) singing hymns in honour of
  the victorious tutelary genii.

Among the spectators (at the performance witnessed by Mrs. Bridges at
Leh) were six deities, represented by six Lamas seated on a bench with
umbrellas over their heads. They had incense swung before them by
attendant priests.

This curious dramatic performance is paralleled in India by the Hindu
drama <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Prabodha-candrodaya, ‘Rise of the moon of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> knowledge,’
in which we have Faith, Volition, Opinion, Imagination, Contemplation,
Devotion, Quietude, Friendship, &c., on one side; Error, Self-conceit,
Hypocrisy, Love, Passion, Anger, Avarice, on the other. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> sets of

being to show how the orthodox <span class="t7 t13 t19 t20 t29 hoverable">faith</span> of the Hindus became victorious
over the erroneous doctrine of the Buddha—the Buddhists and other
heretical sects being represented as adherents of the losing side.

Then—to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> a parallel nearer home—we <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> similar religious dramas

For example, in the old English morality play, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> ‘Every-man,’ some
of the dramatis personæ on the one side are—God, Death, Every-man,
Fellowship, Kindred, Good-deeds, Knowledge, Confession, Beauty,
Strength, Discretion; while on the other are personifications of the
opposite qualities. Then, again, in ‘Lusty Juventus,’ we have a medley
of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Good</span> Counsel, Knowledge, Satan, Hypocrisy, Fellowship, Abominable

Dorje (p. 322) is not the only implement of <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> warfare employed
by the Lamas against the demons[160]. Another important weapon is the
Phurbu or ‘nail,’ described as triangular and wedge-shaped, with the
thin end very sharp-pointed, and with the <span class="t1 t4 t9 t16 hoverable">head</span> of Tamdin (a particular
Dragshed = Haya-griva, noted for his power) emerging from the broad end
and surmounted by a half-thunderbolt for a handle.

According to Schlagintweit, this weapon is often made of cardboard, on
which mystical sentences (Dhara?is) in Sansk?it are inscribed, some
against the demons of the South, some against those of the East, and
some against those of the South-east. In <span class="t5 t16 t21 t24 t25 hoverable">case</span> of illness a Lama goes
round the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> turning the point of the Phurbu in all directions and
uttering magical spells.

Most of the Dhaara?is end with the syllables Hum phat?, the potency of
which in scaring <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> demons is irresistible. Many charms begin with Ah
Tamdin.

Those Phurbus are considered most efficacious which are inscribed with
mystical syllables and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> composed by either the Dalai Lama or
Panchen Lama. These are sold for large sums. It is said (Schlagintweit,
260) that such Phurbus <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> an important article of trade for the
Mongolian pilgrims returning from Tibet.

I was fortunate enough to meet with a remarkable specimen of a magical
weapon of this <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> (called Phur-pa by Jäschke) made of metal, and
shaped like a dagger with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> edges, one for each of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> classes

Dorje (p. 322), and is surmounted by carvings of the heads of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span>
most powerful Dragsheds. I here give a representation of it[161].

[Illustration: ]

It may be easily understood that among a people, steeped in
superstition, a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> armed with such a weapon as this—composed of the
heads of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> potent genii, a <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> thunderbolt and a triple-edged
dagger—would be regarded as a match for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> demon-host.

In Burma the tattooing of mystical squares, triangles and cabalistic
diagrams and figures on various parts of the body, seems to be regarded
as a sufficient substitute for the <span class="t1 hoverable">use</span> of magical weapons, and is held
to be highly efficacious.

Obviously we may contrast the Christian armoury described by S. Paul
(Ephes. vi. 11), ‘the shield of <span class="t7 t13 t19 t20 t29 hoverable">faith</span> and the sword of the Spirit.’ We
might also contrast the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> of Christ, ‘Rejoice not, that the spirits
are subject <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">unto</span> you; but rather rejoice, because your names are <span class="t2 t11 t15 t19 t25 t27 hoverable">written</span>
in heaven’ (S. Luke x. 20).


                      _Domestic Rites and Usages._

I now <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t11 t12 t19 t22 hoverable">pass</span> on to domestic rites and usages, which are as numerous and
important in Buddhist countries as in India. It is said, indeed, that in
Tibet and Mongolia no one is so poor as not to possess an altar in his
dwelling on which he daily lays his offerings, and before which he
performs devotions.

In Ceylon and Burma certain ceremonies <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> soon after the birth
of a child. Mr. Scott, describing those in Burma, says that a fortnight
after birth a fortunate <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> and hour is fixed by an astrologer for the
naming of the infant. A feast is prepared, and all the friends and
relations of the family are invited. ‘The child’s <span class="t1 t4 t9 t16 hoverable">head</span> is usually washed
for the first <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> on this day,’ and some one suggests a name.

The name actually given appears to be a matter of choice, but this is
not so. The consonants of the language are divided into groups, which
are assigned to the <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">days</span> of the week, Sunday having all the vowels to
itself. ‘It is an invariable rule in all respectable families that the
child’s name must begin with one of the letters belonging to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> on
which it was born, but <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">within</span> these limits any name may be chosen.’ A
common belief is that, according to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> of the week (or rather the
constellation representing that day) on which a child is born, so will
its character be.

In this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> every person’s probable characteristics may be inferred. For
example, a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> <span class="t9 t24 hoverable">born</span> on a Monday is likely to be jealous; on Tuesday,
honest; on Wednesday, hot-tempered—but soon appeased—this characteristic
being intensified under the influence of Rahu[162].

Then, again, if <span class="t9 t24 hoverable">born</span> on a Thursday, a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> will probably be mild; on
Friday, talkative; on Saturday, ill-tempered and quarrelsome; on Sunday,
parsimonious. Saturday is a bad <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> for everything. Not only has every
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> its special character and its fixed letters, but there is also
(according to Mr. Scott) a particular animal assigned to symbolize
it—for example, a guinea-pig stands for Friday; a dragon for Saturday; a
tiger for Monday—and red or yellow wax candles are made in the forms of
these animals to be offered at the Pagoda by the pious. Each worshipper
offers the creature-candle representing his birth-day.

Then a careful <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">note</span> is made of the exact hour of birth, with the
important <span class="t24 t25 hoverable">object</span> of drawing up the child’s horoscope. This may be
delayed till the fifth or sixth year, and a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> astrologer may be
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> in for the purpose. He records the year, the month, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> and
hour at which the child was born; the name given to it and the planet in
the ascendant at the moment. All this is scratched neatly on a palm-leaf
with a metal style. On the other side are a <span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span> of cabalistic squares
and numbers from which future calculations may be made.

A <span class="t0 t4 t5 t10 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">person</span> <span class="t9 t24 hoverable">born</span> on Monday remains under the influence of the moon for
fifteen years. Then he passes under Mars for eight years. At the age of
twenty-three Mercury presides over him, and so on through all the
planets to the end of his life, which may be protracted to 108 years.

Rahu, and especially Saturn, have a particularly sinister influence. A
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> does most of the stupid and wicked <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> in his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> while he is in
Saturn’s house. Other details will be found in ‘Shway Yoe.’

The horoscope is carefully kept by the parents until the child is old
enough to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> care of it himself, and thenceforward it is guarded as a
valuable possession.

All these Buddhist customs have their counterpart in the ceremonies of
Brahmanism and Hinduism.

For example, the Hindus have their birth-ceremonies (Jata-karman), and
their name-giving ceremony (Nama-kara?a[163]), and the latter is a
solemn religious act fraught with momentous consequences in its bearing
on a child’s future. Hence Hindu boys are generally <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> after some
god, or the name indicates that the child is the god’s servant.
Horoscopes, too, are as important in India as in Buddhist
countries[164].

In India, too, all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> boys go through the ceremony of tonsure and
cutting off the hair.

Among the Buddhists of Burma a boy is sent to the monastery school at
about the age of eight. Before he can become a novice he has to undergo
the hair-abscission ceremony, followed by shaving every fort-night (as
before described). But those who afterwards elect to lead a secular <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span>

ceremonial, and only to be performed about once a month, partly, says
Mr. Scott, because the washing of a Burman’s luxuriant hair takes a <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span>
time, and partly because too frequent ablutions ‘would disturb and
irritate the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> genius who dwells in the <span class="t1 t4 t9 t16 hoverable">head</span> and protects the man.’

It is considered unlucky to wash the <span class="t1 t4 t9 t16 hoverable">head</span> on a Monday, Friday, or
Saturday; and ‘parents sending their boy to a monastery must remember
not to cut his hair off on a Monday, or on a Friday, or on his
birth-day.’

It is noticeable that a <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of baptism is practised in Tibet and
Mongolia. It is usual to sprinkle <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">children</span> with consecrated water, or
even to immerse them entirely on the <span class="t26 hoverable">third</span> or tenth <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> after birth.
This is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Khrus-sol (according to Jäschke).

The priest consecrates the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> by reciting some formula, while candles
and incense are burning. He then dips the child <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> times, blesses it,
and gives it a name. After performing the ceremony, he draws up the
infant’s horoscope.

Then, so soon as the child can walk and talk, a <span class="t0 t2 t5 t13 t14 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">second</span> ceremony takes
place, when prayers are said for its happy life, and an amulet or little
bag is hung round its neck, filled with spells and charms against <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span>
spirits and diseases.

The <span class="t1 hoverable">use</span> of _amulets_ (Sansk?it kavaca), charms and spells in Northern
Buddhist countries is universal.

At Darjiling I noticed that among the crowds of persons who frequented
the bazaar—many of whom were travellers from Tibet, Nepal, Bhutan, and
Sikkim—almost every one wore an amulet, or a string of amulets round the
neck. Most of these amulets are simply ornamental boxes or receptacles
for supposed relics of saints, or for little images, or pictures, or for
prayer-formularies, worn like breast-plates or phylacteries. They are
composed of wood, bone, and not infrequently of beautifully-worked
filigree silver, embossed and ornamented with turquoise. The shape is
sometimes square, sometimes circular or curved, and <span class="t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> round to a
point[165]. I purchased several specimens, but the vendor of any amulet
in actual <span class="t1 hoverable">use</span> invariably removed the contents before consenting to part
with it. Here is a specimen of one of exceptionally beautiful design
which was given to me by Mr. Sarat Chandra Das. It was <span class="t2 t5 t11 t18 t19 t23 t26 hoverable">taken</span> from the
neck of a woman in the bazaar, but not purchased <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> much
difficulty.

[Illustration: ]

We <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t11 t12 t19 t22 hoverable">pass</span> on next to the Buddhist _marriage-ceremony_. This in Ceylon,
Burma, Tibet, Mongolia, and indeed in all Buddhist countries, is
properly a purely civil contract witnessed only by parents and
guardians. We have already pointed out, that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> Buddhism considers
celibacy to be the only sure means of attaining real sanctity of
character. Consistently with this idea, it has not prescribed any
religious ceremony to be performed by monks or priests, as a condition
of the validity of marriage[166].

Hence among Buddhists the ceremony of marriage is very simple, and has
no religious character, or at any rate no complicated religious
observances connected with it, as among the Hindus[167]. In <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> the
celibate monks of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> Buddhism <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be much scandalized if they were
asked to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> part in the celebration of a wedding, or even to ratify it
by their presence.

The principal ceremony consists in a feast given by the bridegroom or
his parents, to which all the relations, friends, and neighbours are
invited. Nevertheless, in most Buddhist countries in the present <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> the
monks manage to have some remunerative <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> to do in connexion with
weddings; for their business is to fix the most auspicious <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">days</span> for the
performance of the ceremony, in return for which they receive offerings
of various kinds. We know that in India astrology is a chief factor in
all marriage-arrangements. Similarly in most Buddhist countries no
wedding can <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> till the astrologer, who is usually a
monk-priest, has been consulted as to lucky and unlucky combinations,
and the benign or baleful aspects of planets and stars. For example, in
Burma, Saturdays and Thursdays are pronounced unlucky days, and it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span>
be the height of imprudence to marry in certain months of the year.
Then, again, a woman <span class="t9 t24 hoverable">born</span> on a Friday <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be guilty of utter folly if

potentialities.

It should, however, be <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> down to the credit of Buddhism that wives and
daughters are not imprisoned in Zananas, as among Hindus and
Muhammadans. I was present at an evening-party given by a rich native of
Ceylon, when the ladies of the family were introduced to the European
guests, and conversed freely with the rest of the company. Nor is the
marriage of mere boys and girls insisted on in Buddhist countries as in
India. The bridegroom is seldom of a less age than eighteen or nineteen.

Then, again, not only births and marriages, but illnesses and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> are
in the present <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> a source of revenue to the Buddhist monkhood.

First, as to _sickness_.

In Ceylon, when any one is dangerously ill, the monk-priest is summoned
from the neighbouring Vihara, after first sending offerings of flowers,
oil, and food. Then a temporary preaching-place is erected near the
house, and all the relatives and friends, and if possible the sick <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span>
himself, listen to the reading of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Law</span> (Ba?a) for about six hours.
The part especially read and intoned is the Ratna-valiya section of the
Pirit (see p. 317). After the Ba?a a <span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span> of offerings are given to
the reciting priest, including a piece of calico, one end of which is
held by the priest, and the other by the sick man. Then the priest
pronounces a benediction, and says <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> to the following effect:—‘By
reverence do the <span class="t5 t8 hoverable">wise</span> secure health, by almsgiving do they lay up
treasures for themselves[169].’

When the sick <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> is likely to die the priest repeats the Three-refuge
formula (p. 78), the five commandments (p. 126), and the Sati-pa??hana
Sutta (p. 49).

In Burma, if an epidemic happens to break out in any village, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span>
begin by painting the supposed figure of an <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> on a common
earthenware water-pot, and then solemnly smashing it to pieces at sunset
with a heavy stick[170]. Then as soon as it gets dark all the villagers
shout, yell, shriek, and make every <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of deafening din, with the hope
of frightening away the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> who has caused the disease. This
process is continued for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> nights, and if no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> result follows the
monk-priests are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> in from the monastery. They recite the ten
precepts, chant the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Law</span> up and down the road, and intone a particular
sermon of the Buddha, by the preaching of which he once drove away a
pestilence. These means are, of course, not effective unless abundant
alms and gifts are bestowed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the monastery.

According to Koeppen and Huc the <span class="t1 t3 t4 t7 t8 t14 t15 t16 t17 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">art</span> of medicine in Northern Buddhist
countries is practised exclusively by the Lamas. The theory is that
there are 140 different maladies, and that most of these are caused by
devils. The monk-priests are the sole doctors, and a sick <span class="t0 t4 t5 t10 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">person</span> can
only be cured by them. One process is simple. It begins by the Lama
doctor writing the name of a remedy <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> a morsel of paper, moistening
it with saliva, and rolling it into a pill. The patient takes the paper
pellet with as much <span class="t7 t13 t19 t20 t29 hoverable">faith</span> as if he were swallowing the veritable drug.
Many Mongols believe that ‘it is precisely the same, <span class="t0 t5 t8 t10 t14 t15 t21 t24 t28 hoverable">whether</span> you swallow
a drug or its <span class="t2 t11 t15 t19 t25 t27 hoverable">written</span> appellation.’ Then, ‘if the patient be poor, the
devil is a little one, and may be dislodged by a few prayers; but, if he
be rich, the <span class="t5 t16 t21 t24 t25 hoverable">case</span> is different; fine clothes, handsome boots, or even a
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> horse must be presented, or he will not consent to turn out.’

A very effective medicine may be composed of the bones of some pious
Lama ground into a powder. This may be given alone or in combination
with other substances.

It appears to be essential that the prayers recited on these occasions
should be accompanied by terrific noises. M. Huc relates a story of an
old woman—the aunt of a certain chief—who was one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> attacked by
intermittent fever. The Lama, of course, announced that a devil had
possession of her body; and so in the evening he and eight other Lamas
began operations for its expulsion. First they made a little figure or
manikin of dried herbs, which they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the devil of intermittent
fevers. This they stuck upright in the tent of the sick woman. Then at
eleven o’clock at night the Lamas ranged themselves at the back of the
tent, armed with bells, tambourines, conch-shells, and other noisy
instruments. Nine members of the family closed the circle in front,
crouching on the ground, while the old woman remained seated on her
heels in front of the manikin. Next, ‘at a given signal, the orchestra
performed an overture capable of scaring away the most imperturbable and
obstinate devil, while all the secular assistants beat <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> with their
<span class="t20 hoverable">hands</span> to the hubbub of the instruments and the howling of the prayers.
When this demoniacal music was over, the chief Lama began his exorcisms,
scattering millet seeds around as he proceeded; sometimes speaking low,
sometimes in stentorian tones. Then, appearing to throw himself into a
passion, he addressed animated appeals, with violent gesticulation, to
the manikin.’ Finally, after further incantations, he gave a signal; the
Lamas thundered out a noisy chorus, the instruments added to the din,
and the members of the family rushing out in file, made the circuit of
the tent, striking it frantically with stakes, and uttering terrific
cries. Finally, the chief Lama and his assistants, after joining in the
yells, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> to the manikin. This ended the ceremony; the demon being
compelled to beat a retreat.

Mr. Sarat Chandra Das has given an <span class="t1 t11 t12 t13 t16 t18 t21 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of a somewhat similar
ceremony in Tibet performed by some Lamas to cure him of a sickness. An
image representing the patient, and supposed to resemble him, was
constructed, and a suit of his clothes placed in front of it, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span>
with portions of his usual <span class="t0 t14 t23 t24 hoverable">food</span> and drink. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Two</span> Lamas then muttered
mystic sentences, ringing a bell, waving a Dorje (see p. 323 of these
Lectures), and twisting their fingers and <span class="t20 hoverable">hands</span> into the mysterious
shapes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Mudra (p. 241). Next they broke out into alternate
exhortations and threats, and at the conclusion of the ceremony the
officiating priests supplicated the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">lord</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> (Yama) to accept the
image in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> of the moribund man.

On another occasion, when Mr. Sarat Chandra Das was seriously ill in
Tibet, an effective method of curing his disease was proposed to him,
and, with his consent, actually carried out. This mainly consisted in
the ransoming of fish-life. A certain Lama started off for a fisherman’s
village, and in a short <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> returned in a <span class="t17 t29 hoverable">high</span> <span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> of satisfaction.
He had saved the lives of five hundred fishes for the benefit of the
sick man. The merit of this deed was credited to the patient on his
repeating the following prayer:—

longevity, prosperity, and happiness perpetually accrue to me.’

In the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> in Burma, in times of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> heat and drought, when the
ponds and tanks appear to be on the point of drying up, it is held to be

them alive to the rivers. (See Scott’s ‘Burman,’ ii. 43.)

Similarly a bird-catcher will sell live birds to pious persons, that
they may gain merit by releasing them.

We <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t11 t12 t19 t22 hoverable">pass</span> on, in the next place, to the usages and ceremonies common at
death.

If a man’s <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> is to be separated from his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> properly and
peacefully, so as not to hurt the survivors, and in a manner likely to
cause a happy re-birth for himself, alms must be bestowed on the
monk-priests, and their presence must be invited for the repetition of
prayers. In Ceylon and Burma monks go to the houses of mourners and
repeat portions of the Pirit (see p. 317).

In Tibet the priest not only recites prayers but compresses the skull
till it appears to crack, or else the hair is torn off and a little
incision is made, to enable the dying man’s <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> to escape. The priest
then settles what method of burial is to be followed, and the place, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span>
and hour, all of which depend on astrological combinations, known only
to him.

The method of disposing of a dead <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> differs in all Buddhist countries
according to station, condition, rank, and wealth.

In Ceylon the bodies of monks are all burnt, and the cremation
ceremonies are carried out under decorated arches or canopies, which are
never removed, but <span class="t1 t7 t12 t29 hoverable">left</span> to crumble away.

In Burma the cremation of a monk distinguished for sanctity is an affair
of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> <span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> and ceremonial. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> (see Mr. Scott’s ‘Burman,’ ii.
331) is first embalmed, and next tightly wrapped in white cloth, which
is varnished and afterwards covered with gold-leaf. The corpse <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span>
gilded is placed in an unclosed inner coffin, and <span class="t1 t7 t12 t29 hoverable">left</span> exposed to <span class="t25 hoverable">view</span>
for a considerable time. When fastened down, the inner coffin is covered
with gold-leaf, like the body. An outer sarcophagus is then prepared,
and painted to represent scenes from the lives of the Buddha. This is
placed in a building erected for the purpose, and there the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> lies in
<span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> for several months, while a constant line of pilgrim-worshippers
<span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t11 t12 t19 t22 hoverable">pass</span> in and out. In process of time, when enough money for the expenses
has been collected, a grand cremation takes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> under a lofty canopy,
which on special occasions may be fifty or sixty feet high. The calcined
bones are then reverentially collected, and either buried near the
temple or pounded and made up into a paste, with which an image of the
<span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> is constructed for <span class="t0 t5 t11 hoverable">worship</span> in the monastery.

In Tibet the bodies of the Grand Lamas are generally embalmed and
preserved in monuments or Stupas. Other Lamas and monks distinguished
for sanctity are burnt, and their ashes are either distributed as
relics, or preserved in idols or in small Dagabas. Kings, princes, and
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> are also burnt, and of course with much ceremony and
repetition of prayers. Then for a <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> afterwards prayers continue
to be recited by the priests, the <span class="t24 t25 hoverable">object</span> being to propitiate Yama, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">god</span>
of Death, and to deliver the deceased from the possible purgatorial
torments of one of the hells. It is said that this repetition of prayers
is prolonged, in the <span class="t5 t16 t21 t24 t25 hoverable">case</span> of the rich, for seven weeks, and in the <span class="t5 t16 t21 t24 t25 hoverable">case</span>
of princes, for a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> year.

Mr. J. Ware Edgar, C.S.I., in his interesting Report of his visit to
Sikkim in 1873, gives a description of the remarkable funeral ceremonies
performed on the occasion of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> of the Raja of Sikkim’s sister
(see p. 62), which I here abbreviate:—

  The Raja’s sister had died a few <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">days</span> after his return to Choombi. The
  <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> had been buried at Choombi, but her clothes had been sent to
  Toomlong, and her <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> was supposed to accompany them. There a
  lay-figure meant to represent her, dressed in her costume as a nun,
  and wearing a gilt mitre and a <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> white veil, was placed on a <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span>
  of throne to the right of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> altar in the principal chapel.
  Before the figure was a table, on which were different kinds of food.
  On another table were various <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> which had belonged to her, while
  on a third, 108 little brass lamps were arranged in rows. Some <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">days</span>
  afterwards the lay-figure of the nun was <span class="t2 t5 t11 t18 t19 t23 t26 hoverable">taken</span> to Pemyangchi. There,
  for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">days</span> the figure was seated before the altar, and the monks
  chanted the litanies for her soul, which had accompanied her clothes
  from Choombi. On the <span class="t26 hoverable">third</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> towards evening the tea-cup of the nun
  was freshly filled with tea, and all the monks solemnly drank tea with
  her. The monks chanted the litanies, and the <span class="t1 t4 t9 t16 hoverable">Head</span> Lama <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> through
  some elaborate ceremonies. At about nine o’clock the chanting ceased,
  and the Lama made a <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> speech to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> of the nun, in which he
  told her that all that could be done to make her journey to another
  <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> easy, had been done, and that now she <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have to go alone and
  unassisted to appear before the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span> and Judge of the dead.

  ‘You will have to leave your robes, your mitre, and your veil,’ said
  he, ‘and clad in the black garment of your sins, or in the shining
  garment of your <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> deeds, you will be shown the mirror of the just
  King. Your gold and silver, your rank, your <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> name will not help
  you, when your <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> deeds are weighed against your <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> deeds, in the
  scales of the King. If you have done ill, you will be punished; but if
  your sins are found to be lighter than your <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> works, your reward
  will be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> indeed.’

  When the Lama had finished his address, some of the monks <span class="t2 t4 t6 t9 t18 t19 t22 hoverable">took</span> down
  the lay-figure and undressed it, while others formed a procession and
  conducted the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> of the nun into the darkness outside the monastery,
  with a discordant noise of conch-shells, thigh-bone trumpets, Tibetan
  flutes, gongs, cymbals, tambourines, and drums.

In Japan small portions of the calcined remains (often not larger than
peas) are preserved in globular glass shrines, and then duly honoured
and worshipped.

The method of disposing of the dead bodies of the laity and of the
common <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> is generally much more simple. In most Buddhist countries
laymen are buried, and the priests lead the processions to the grave. In
Ceylon, the laity are certainly, as a rule, buried and not burnt.

In Burma rich laymen are also generally buried, and, according to Mr.
Scott, the funeral is a grand affair.

The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> is swathed in new white cotton cloth, leaving the <span class="t3 hoverable">face</span>
uncovered. A piece of gold or silver is placed between the teeth to
serve as ferry-money over the Buddhist Styx—the terrible river of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span>
which all deceased persons are compelled to pass. This river is clearly
the counterpart of the Vaitara?i of the Hindus (see ‘Brahmanism and
Hinduism,’ p. 297).

If the dead man’s family is poor, a copper coin or even a betel nut will
suffice. Next the monks are sent for, their immediate presence being
necessary to keep off the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> spirits who always swarm near a corpse.
After an interval the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> is placed in a coffin, which is sometimes
gilded and placed on a bier under a canopy. When the right <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> arrives
for the funeral, a <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> procession is formed, with a <span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span> of priests
in proportion to the amount of alms bestowed, and a crowd of relations,
friends, and neighbours. Occasionally those who carry the bier stop and
go through a sort of solemn dance, while mournful tunes are played by
the musicians and funeral dirges are sung. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> is finally buried in
a cemetery to the west of the town or village. A funeral must never go
to the north or to the east. The ceremony concludes by alms to the
priests, who in return intone the commandments and other portions of the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Law</span> in Pali. After the funeral, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> festivities go on in the
family-abode for the benefit of the crowds who come to offer condolence.
Then the presence of the priests is again needed, and has to be paid for
by alms to the monastery, or the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> spirits, who are sure to hang
about, cannot be got rid of. In some parts of Burma the cremation of
rich laymen is not uncommon, and the ashes are either deposited in
Dagabas—that is, in small Stupas or Pagodas[171]—or are pounded into
paste and made into miniature Stupas (p. 506) or into small images of
the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> for <span class="t0 t5 t11 hoverable">worship</span> at the domestic altar.

In Tibet and Mongolia the corpses of the laity, especially of the poor,
are often exposed in the fields, in deserts, or on mountain tops, or
rocks, or in lonely ravines, or sometimes in open places enclosed for
the purpose. Occasionally they are covered with a thin layer of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> or
loose stones. Usually they are devoured by vultures, dogs, and other
animals.

It seems that in Lhassa certain dogs are kept for that purpose[172]. A
class of professional <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> exist there, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> business it is to cut up
dead bodies, and throw the <span class="t6 t20 hoverable">flesh</span> piecemeal to dogs and vultures. Even
the bones are sometimes pounded, and the dust, being mixed with flour,
is given to be devoured. The strange <span class="t3 t5 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">thing</span> is, that this <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of burial
is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> desirable, and even honourable. To be eaten up by sacred dogs
after <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> is productive of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> merit, and leads to re-birth in
<span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> forms. Dogs are the mausoleums of Lhassa.

According to M. Huc, a common funeral ceremony among the Mongols
consists in carrying the corpse to the summit of a mountain, or to the
bottom of a ravine. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> is walled up in a sort of kiln of a
pyramidal form, with a small door at the bottom, and an opening at the
top to maintain a current of air, and allow the smoke to escape. During
the combustion the Lamas recite prayers. When the corpse is consumed,
the kiln is demolished. Then the bones are collected and carried to the
Grand Lama, who reduces them to a powder, and, after adding an equal
quantity of wheaten flour, kneads the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> carefully, and, with his own
hands, fashions a <span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span> of cakes of various sizes. These are afterwards
placed in a pyramidal Stupa, which has been built beforehand in some
auspicious place.

The soil of the famous monastery of the Five Towers in the province of
Shan Si, is said to be so <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">holy</span> that those interred there are sure to
effect a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> transmigration. In the deserts of Tartary, Mongols are
frequently seen carrying on their shoulders the bones of their kindred,
and journeying to the Five Towers—there to purchase, almost at its
weight in gold, a little surface of ground whereon to erect a small
Stupa. Some of them undertake a toilsome journey of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> year’s
duration, to reach this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">holy</span> spot (see p. 435).

Burial in rivers, which is highly prized by the Hindus, is not in favour
among Buddhists. Only very poor <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> allow their dead to be thrown
into rivers, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> this is the only <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of Buddhist burial mentioned
by Alberuni (Sachau, ii. 169). Buddhism, from the first, repudiated the
Hindu funeral ceremonies <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> ?raddhas, which are still a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>
incubus on the people. The poorest <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> in India, if he be of <span class="t17 t29 hoverable">high</span> caste,
cannot perform a ?raddha for a relation for a less sum than forty
rupees, given in fees to the priests. Buddhism did <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> service in

established something similar in the Bardo ceremony (p. 334).


                        _Formularies of Prayer._

With regard to prayer-formularies, there is in modern times a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> deal
of difference between Southern and Northern Buddhist countries. We have
seen that the three-refuge formulary was the sole prayer of early
Buddhists. Certain orthodox <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> whom I met in Ceylon, maintained to me
that this is the only legitimate <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of prayer that ought to be <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">used</span>
even in the present day. It is certainly a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> which is accepted and
employed by all Buddhists of whatever nationality.

Tsong Khapa, it is said, established at Lhassa an annual
prayer-congregation <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Monlam Chenpo (see p. 386). But the most
common prayer <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">used</span> in Tibet is a mere formulary, the constant repetition
of which is one of the most amazing instances of the tyranny of
superstition to be found in any part of the world.

It consists of the six-syllabled sentence, Om ma?i padme Hum, ‘Om! the
Jewel in the Lotus! Hum!’

This prayer, or rather mystical sentence, is supposed to have been
composed by Padma-pa?i (Avalokite?vara), and to have reference to his
own manifestation as the Patron-Saint of Tibet[173]. It is sometimes
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the Ma?i or ‘Jewel’ prayer, and, if brevity is a valuable
quality, its excellence is undeniable, since it consists of merely <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span>
Sansk?it words, between <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> mystical, untranslatable auspicious
ejaculations, Om and Hum[174].

Doubtless the prayer really owes its origin to the close connexion which
sprang up between Northern Buddhism and ?aivism. The worshippers of ?iva
have always <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">used</span> (compare p. 240) similar mystical sentences and
syllables <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Dhara?is, to which a <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of miraculous efficacy is
attributed. In all probability an occult <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> underlies the
‘Jewel-lotus’ formula, and my own belief is that the majority of those
who repeat it are ignorantly doing homage to the self-generative <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span>
supposed to inhere in the universe—a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> pointed at by the popular
Sa?khya theory of the union of Prak?iti and Purusha, and by the
universal <span class="t0 t5 t11 hoverable">worship</span> of the Li?ga and Yoni throughout India[175]. No
thoughtful <span class="t0 t4 t5 t10 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">person</span> can have travelled much in India <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> being
impressed with this.

At all events, whatever be its origin and meaning, no other prayer <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">used</span>
by <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t0 t1 t15 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> in any quarter of the globe is repeated so often. Every
Tibetan believes it to be a panacea for all evil, a compendium of all
knowledge, a treasury of all wisdom, a summary of all religion. But if
you ask Northern Buddhists to give you the <span class="t1 t11 t16 t20 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">reason</span> for this belief, very
few are able to give an intelligible reply. According to the most
learned doctors of philosophy who are to be found in Tibetan
monasteries, it is certainly addressed to their patron deity
Avalokite?vara, and the real secret of its efficacy lies in the fact,
that each one of its six syllables has a potent influence on some one of
the six _Gatis_ or courses of being—that is to say, on some one of the
six kinds of transmigration or transformation through which every living
<span class="t22 t25 hoverable">individual</span> has to <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t11 t12 t19 t22 hoverable">pass</span> (see p. 121)[176].

The oftener, therefore, this mystical formula is repeated the shorter
will be an individual’s course (gati) through some of these six forms of
existence, every one of which involves misery or evil. Or it may be that
by repeating it he will be able to escape some of the six existences
altogether.

Strange indeed as it may appear to us, it is impossible to shake the
<span class="t7 t13 t19 t20 t29 hoverable">faith</span> of a Lamistic Buddhist in the absolutely infallible efficacy of
his six favourite mystic syllables. He repeats them, not at all as if he
were praying in a Christian sense, but as if he were a farmer intent on
planting the very best seed in the most productive soil, and watering it
incessantly according to the most scientific principles of irrigation. A
bountiful harvest is absolutely certain to reward his efforts.

It need not, therefore, surprise us if these six syllables are murmured
morning, noon, and night, by every man, woman, and child, wherever the
Lamistic Hierarchy has extended. And, if not repeated by the voice, an
incessant stream of repetition—an incessant scattering of the six mystic
seeds—is kept going by the hand.

The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> are <span class="t2 t11 t15 t19 t25 t27 hoverable">written</span> or printed on roll <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">within</span> roll of paper and
inscribed in cylinders, which, when made to revolve either by educated
monks or by illiterate laymen, have the same efficacy as if they were
actually said or repeated. The revolutions are credited as so much
prayer-merit, or, to <span class="t6 t9 t11 t19 t20 t22 hoverable">speak</span> more scientifically, as so much
_prayer-force_, accumulated and stored up for the benefit of the <span class="t0 t4 t5 t10 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">person</span>
who revolves them.

The cylinder is generally made of metal, the prayer being engraved on
the outside, as <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as <span class="t2 t11 t15 t19 t25 t27 hoverable">written</span> on paper and inserted inside. It is held
in the right <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> and whirled round, like a child’s toy, by means of a
handle in a particular direction (with the sun). If made to revolve the
other way, its rotations will be <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> down to the debtor rather than the
creditor side of the owner’s account. Here is a drawing of one of
several hand-cylinders (commonly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> prayer-wheels or prayer-mills;
Tibetan, Chos-kor or Chos-kyi or Khor-lo), obtained by me at Darjiling:—

Then, again, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> of the prayer are <span class="t2 t11 t15 t19 t25 t27 hoverable">written</span> or printed millions and
millions of times on rolls or strips of paper, and enclosed in much
larger barrel-like cylinders, which are <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> up in temples, chapels,
monasteries, corridors, passages, houses, villages, by the road side,
and in every possible corner, for the convenience of the mass of the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> who are too ignorant to read, and too indolent to engage in
continuous oral repetition[177].

It sometimes happens that quarrels arise from rival claims in regard to
the <span class="t1 hoverable">use</span> of such prayer-cylinders. In illustration of this an amusing
story is told by the French missionaries:—

One <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> when they happened to be passing a praying-machine, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> up near
a monastery, they saw <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> Lamas engaged in a violent quarrel; and, as it
appeared, all on <span class="t1 t11 t12 t13 t16 t18 t21 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of their zeal for their prayers. The <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> was
that one Lama had come, and, having <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> the barrel in motion for his own
benefit, was retiring modestly and complacently to his own abode, when
happening to turn his <span class="t1 t4 t9 t16 hoverable">head</span> to enjoy the spectacle of the wheel’s pious
revolutions, he saw the other Lama stop it, and <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> it whirling again
for himself. Indignant, of course, at this unwarrantable interference
with his own devotions, he ran back, and in his turn put a stop to his
rival’s piety, and both of them continued this <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of demonstration for
some time, till at last losing patience they proceeded to menaces, and
then to blows, when an old Lama came out of a neighbouring cell, and
<span class="t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> the difficulty to a peaceful termination by himself twirling the
prayer-barrel for the benefit of both parties.

On the occasion of my visiting Darjiling in 1884, I was desirous of
judging for myself of the method of using these remarkable instruments
of religion. I therefore, soon after my arrival, walked to a Buddhist
temple near the town. There I found several large barrel-like cylinders
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> up close <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> in a row at the entrance, so that no one might
<span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t11 t12 t19 t22 hoverable">pass</span> in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> giving them at least one twirl, or by a rapid sweep of
his <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> might <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> them all twirling at once. Inside the
entrance-portico a shrivelled and exceptionally hideous old woman was
seated on the ground. In her <span class="t1 t7 t12 t29 hoverable">left</span> <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> she held a small portable
prayer-cylinder, which she kept in perpetual revolution. In her right
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> was a cord connected with a huge barrel-like cylinder, which with
some exertion she made to rotate on its axis by help of a crank, while
she kept muttering _Om ma?i pamme Hum_ (so she pronounced it) with
amazing rapidity. In this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> she completed at least sixty oral
repetitions every minute, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> reckoning the infinite <span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span> of
rotatory repetitions accomplished simultaneously by her <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> hands. And
all this was done with an appearance of apathy and mental vacuity in her
withered face, which was so distressing and melancholy to behold, that
the spectacle will never be effaced from my memory. In <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> the
venerable dame seemed to be sublimely unconscious that any effort of
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> or concentration of either <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> or <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">heart</span> was needed to make
prayer of any value at all.

And the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> of Tibet are quite as much slaves to this superstition as
the women. A friend of <span class="t6 hoverable">mine</span> when staying at Darjiling had some
conversation on serious subjects with an apparently sensible native, and
observed with surprise that all the while he was engaged in talking with
the Buddhist, the latter continued diligently whirling a prayer-cylinder
with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> velocity. My friend, being unacquainted with Tibetan customs,
came away from his colloquy under the impression that Buddhists regard
Christians as dangerous lunatics possessed with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> spirits, which
require specially active measures in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> of exorcism. It did not
occur to him that the Buddhist was merely intent on redeeming every
instant of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> for the purpose of storing up merit by prayer.

And the hold which this extraordinary superstition has <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the
population is still more forcibly impressed on the traveller who
penetrates into the regions beyond Darjiling. He may there see immense
prayer-cylinders <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> up like mills, and kept in incessant revolution,
not by the will or <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> of man, but by the blind, unconscious force of
wind and water.

It is even said that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> mechanical ingenuity is displayed by the
monks in some parts of Tibet, their inventive powers being stimulated by
a burning <span class="t0 t10 t11 t17 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">desire</span> to economize <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> and labour in the production of
prayer-merit by machinery.

An intricate arrangement of huge wheels and other wheels <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">within</span> wheels,
like the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t7 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">works</span> of a clock, is connected with rows of cylinders and made
to revolve rapidly by means of heavy weights. An infinite <span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span> of
prayers are repeated in this manner by a single monk, who takes a minute
or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> to wind up the complicated <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> machinery, and then hastens
to help his brothers in industrial occupations—the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> fraternity
feeling that the ingenious contrivance of praying by clock-work enables
them to promote the common weal by making the most of both worlds. The
story goes that, in times of special need and emergency, additional
weights are attached to the machinery, and, of course, increased cogency
given to the rotatory prayers. It is to be hoped that when European
inventions <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> across the Himalayas, steam-power may not be
pressed into the service of these gross superstitions.

The <span class="t1 hoverable">use</span> of prayer-wheels of various kinds is also common in Japan, as
described in Sir Edward Reed’s work.

But praying by machinery is not all. Beneficial results are believed to
accrue through the carving of the all-powerful six syllables on every
conceivable object.

The traveller, as he walks along, sees the mystic <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> impressed on the
stones at his feet, on rocks, doors, monuments, and trees. Indeed, rich
and zealous Buddhists maintain at their own expense, companies of Lamas
for the sole <span class="t24 t25 hoverable">object</span> of propagating the Ma?i-padme formula. These strange
missionaries may occasionally be encountered, chisel and hammer in hand,
traversing field, hill, dale, and desert, their only mission being to
engrave the sacred six syllables on every rock in their path (Huc, ii.
194).

Absolutely incalculable is the grand total of Ma?i-padmes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> placed to
the credit of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> of living <span class="t0 t1 t15 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> during the short space of
twenty-four hours. Yet, at the end of the New Year’s festival in Tibet,
the chief Lama will sometimes pretend to proclaim the exact sum of
mystic syllables supposed to have been repeated during its continuance,
amounting perhaps to billions <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> billions, for the consolation of all
those faithful Buddhists who, oppressed by the evils of life, are
seeking for some antidote.

But the ‘jewel-lotus’ is not the only antidote. There are other short
prayer-formularies, such as Om Vajra-pa?i-Hum (addressed to the
Bodhi-sattva Vajra-pa?i, p. 201), and other still more mystical
ejaculations (such as Om ah Hum); and magical sentences, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Dharani,
and profoundly significant monosyllables, such as Ram, Pha?, H?im, H?im,
?im, ?im, H?is.

And here in connexion with the ubiquity of prayer-formularies, we must
not omit to notice the _Praying-walls_, that is, the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> stone walls or
banks <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> (from the ‘jewel-lotus’ prayer inscribed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> them)
_Ma?i_[178], or in the provincial dialect <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Man</span> Dang (variously Man-dong,
Mendong).

These remarkable stone-structures, peculiar to Lamism, are erected by
the side of high-roads, and in frequented thoroughfares, with the simple
<span class="t24 t25 hoverable">object</span> of aiding in the accumulation of prayer-merit. Some are only a
few feet long, six feet high, and from six to twelve feet broad; others
have been met with nearly 1000 yards long, with pyramidal Stupas[179] or
Caityas (in Tibetan Chortens) at each end. Inserted in these walls are
slabs on which the six-syllabled, and other prayer-formulas, and
sometimes images of saints, are carved and dedicated as votive
offerings. Passing travellers acquire merit by keeping them on their
<span class="t1 t7 t12 t29 hoverable">left</span> side[180], so that they may follow the letters of the inscription
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> necessarily repeating the words[181].

In the same connexion we may advert to _Praying-flags_ and
_Praying-staffs_. And I may mention that, while staying at Darjiling, I
visited a village to which a monastery is attached, and, on approaching
the spot, was surprised to see the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> neighbourhood studded with
poles from which <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> flags were flying. On the tops of the poles were
curious ornaments like caps, made of coloured cloth with flounces. I
naturally supposed that I had arrived on a gala day, and that at least a
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Lama or other <span class="t17 t29 hoverable">high</span> functionary was expected, perhaps to lay the
first stone of some new building connected with the monastery. On
inquiry, however, I ascertained that there was nothing unusual about the
appearance of the village, which was merely praying, according to
custom, by means of its flag-staffs. Every <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> the wind, which happened
to be blowing fresh, extended the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> flags, a vast <span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span> of prayers
were credited to the inhabitants who were themselves all absent, and
probably hard at <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> either in the fields or at Darjiling.

I managed to obtain facsimiles of some of the flags. On them are
inscribed various versions of the inevitable Ma?i-padme formulary,
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> with figures of the ‘flying-horse’ (Lungta, strictly rLu?-rta,
‘wind-horse’)[182] and other symbols, such as those of the Norbu
gem[183] and of the Phurbu—which are held to be peculiarly efficacious
in warding off <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> spirits or neutralizing the diseases inflicted by
them. Indeed in most cases these flags are regarded by the peasantry as
talismans or charms to protect the village from the malice of
mischievous ghosts and demons, believed to haunt the atmosphere and
swarm everywhere around.

Here are some of the mystic formularies inscribed on my flags. They
resemble ?aiva Mantras and Dhara?is—that is, mystical <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> or sentences
<span class="t0 t12 hoverable">used</span> as spells:—

Om ma?i padme Hum Hring, Om Vajra-pa?i Hum, Om a Hum, Om Vag-i?vari Mum,
Sarva-siddhi-phala Hum, Om muni muni maha-muni, ?akya-muni svaha, Om
vajra-sattva Hum, Hulu hulu, Rulu rulu, Hum Pha?, etc. (Compare my
‘Brahmanism,’ etc. p. 197).

One flag in my possession has representations of four animals at the
four corners, viz. a Tiger, Lion, Eagle, and Dragon[184]—supposed to act
as guards against <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> spirits. It also has an inscription in Tibetan
which was translated for me by Mr. Sarat Chandra Das, thus:—

  ‘Reverence be to the Buddhas and Bodhi-sattvas! <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hath</span> it been
  <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t18 hoverable">heard</span> by me—once on a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> when the adorable ?akya-Buddha was seated

  the Prince of Gods, arrived there, after being completely defeated by
  the demons (Asuras). Seeing the Buddha, and throwing himself at his
  feet, he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> reverentially addressed him:—“Oh, my Lord, we the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span>

  <span class="t20 hoverable">hands</span> of the demons; instruct us, what are we to do? how are we to
  triumph over our enemies?” To this the adorable one replied:—“O <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">lord</span>

  Punggyan, which, when repeated, will make you unconquerable. I, too,
  in my former existence of a Bodhi-sattva found it efficacious in
  securing victory.”’

It is of course a <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> merit to erect prayer-flags. They <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> a
conspicuous feature in every landscape throughout Tibet, fluttering on
hills and in valleys, by the roadside, and on the river bank, on walls
and on the tops of houses, in streets, squares, and gardens.

Then, again, the duty of a constant repetition of prayer-formulæ and
mystical sentences has led Northern Buddhists to employ _Rosaries_,
which were <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">used</span> both by Hindus and Buddhists <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> before they came into
vogue in Europe. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Without</span> these necessary aids to devotion the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span>
rounds of repetition could not be accurately completed. In Northern
Buddhist countries rosaries ought to consist of 108 beads, which in
Tibet are said to represent the 108[185] volumes of the Kanjur. The same
<span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span> of beads is <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">used</span> by the worshippers of Vish?u, who <span class="t1 hoverable">use</span> the rosary
to aid them in repeating any one of the names of Vish?u 800 times, the
eight additional beads marking each century of repetitions.

The commonest Buddhist rosaries are made of wood, or pebbles, or
berries, or bone[186]; the more costly, of turquoise, coral, amber, or
silver, or even of pearls and gems. If a rosary made of the bones of
some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">holy</span> Lama can be procured, it is of course prized above all others.
Sometimes a Dorje is appended. Northern Buddhist worshippers hold their
rosaries (like Roman Catholics) in the right hand, and move on the beads
with the left, and they will do this while talking <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> or even
quarrelling. In China and Japan Buddhist rosaries are often arranged in
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> rings. They sometimes consist of enormous beads with relics in the
central bead.

Be it observed, however, that the prayer-formularies of Buddhists are
not always a mere unintelligible string of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> and syllables,
muttered, iterated, and reiterated with the aid of rosaries. Their
prayers sometimes contain lofty sentiments. For instance, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span>

  Reverence to all the noble Father-Lamas! I address this to the feet of
  Duang our patron saint. I, Milaraspa[187], sing it. If the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> be
  white (enlightened), it must be white inside and outside. I am <span class="t9 t24 hoverable">born</span> in
  consequence of the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t7 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">works</span> of this world. My earthly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">father</span> is a sower
  of the seed of sin. My mother is the soil which receives the seed of
  sin. The child is myself tied to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">father</span> by the cord of sin. When
  you think of your earthly father, think also of your Lama (spiritual
  father). Your earthly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">father</span> is the source of your sin. Your Lama
  frees you from sin[188].

But this song, which was repeated over and over again, invariably
concluded by a repetition of the inevitable six-syllabled formula. This
they repeated very rapidly, pronouncing it as usual, ‘Om ma?i-pamme
Hum,’ and adding the mystical syllable H?is. Their chanting was
accompanied by an incessant agitation of their ?amaru or sacred drum,
which I was able to purchase. It is shaped like <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> hemispheres, joined
on their convex sides, and is encircled by sacred shells. It is sounded
by means of buttons attached to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> pendulous strips of leather. The
sound made by these drums is out of all proportion to their size. It may
be <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t18 hoverable">heard</span> at a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> distance, and is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> to be highly efficacious in
frightening away <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> spirits, who dislike loud noises of all kinds.
Here is an exact representation of the sacred drum now in my
possession:—

Again, Dr. Eitel (Lectures, iii.) mentions a manual of daily prayer <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">used</span>
by Northern Buddhists, which shows that striking <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> are sometimes
chanted, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> they may be in Sansk?it, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> unintelligible to
those who repeat them. For instance, the following:—

‘May all the Buddhas abide in me, instruct and enlighten me with
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> and perfection, <span class="t1 t8 hoverable">free</span> me, deliver me, cleanse me, purify me;
and may the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> universe be <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> <span class="t1 t8 hoverable">free</span> (Sarva-tathagata ma? samavasantu
buddhya siddhya bodhaya vibodhaya mocaya vimocaya ?odhaya vi?odhaya

Before, therefore, concluding this Lecture we must acknowledge, in
fairness to the inhabitants of Tibet, that much of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> of
religion may be mingled with their superstitions. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> of their
prayers are not merely repeated by machinery, <span class="t2 t11 t15 t19 t25 t27 hoverable">written</span> on paper, and
inscribed on rocks and stones. The voices of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> and women, if not their
thoughts, often go heartily with uttered prayers. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">note</span> of prayer is
raised at all times and seasons—in the morning, mid-day, and evening, in
private and in public, at home or abroad, in the midst of labour and
idleness, in lying down and rising up, in moving about and keeping
still, on the march and on the battle-field, on mournful occasions, and
in the midst of joy and laughter. Nor is any one ashamed of praying
aloud or praying <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> in the open streets and squares of crowded
towns.

‘There exists,’ says the French Missionary (ii. 194), ‘a very touching
custom at Lhassa. In the evening, just as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> is verging on its
decline, all the Tibetans stop business and meet together, men, women,
and children, according to their sex and age, in the principal parts of
the town and in the public squares. As soon as groups are formed, every
one kneels down, and they begin slowly and in undertones to chant
prayers.

‘The religious concerts produced by these numerous assemblages create
throughout the town a solemn harmony, which operates forcibly on the
soul. The first <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> we witnessed this spectacle, we could not help
drawing a painful comparison between this pagan town, where all prayed
together, and the cities of Europe, where <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> blush to make the
sign of the cross in public.’




                              LECTURE XIV.
                            _Sacred Places._


It was only to be expected, that Buddhism, closely connected as it was
with Brahmanism and Hinduism, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> in some respects opposed to those
systems, should have certain sacred places and hallowed regions, some of
which were identical with those of Brahmanism and Hinduism, and some
peculiarly its own.

In the Maha-parinibbana-sutta (V. 16-22, Rhys Davids), we have the
following declaration:—

  ‘There are four places which the believing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> should visit as a
  pilgrim with feelings of reverence and awe. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> at which he can
  say, “Here the Tathagata (one of the names of Buddha, see p. 23) was
  born.” The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> at which he can say, “Here the Tathagata attained to
  perfect insight and enlightenment.” The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> at which he can say,
  “Here the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Law</span> was first preached by the Tathagata.” The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> at which
  he can say, “Here the Tathagata passed finally away in that utter
  passing away which leaves nothing whatever behind” (see p. 142, note,
  and p. 477).

  ‘And they who die, while with believing <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">heart</span> they journey on such
  pilgrimages, shall be reborn, in the happy realms of heaven.’

The Chinese traveller, Fa-hien, names the same four sacred places (Chap.
xxxi.), and says that the situation of the four <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Stupas (see p.
504) has been fixed, namely, (1) where the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> was born, (2) where he
attained wisdom, (3) where he began to turn the wheel of his Law, (4)
where he attained Pari-nirva?a (p. 142). Compare engraving of sculpture
opposite p. 477.

Elsewhere Fa-hien mentions <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> other sacred spots—the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> where the
<span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> discomfited the advocates of erroneous doctrines[189], and the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> where he descended after ascending to the Trayastri??a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heaven</span> (see
p. 414 of this volume), to preach the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Law</span> to his mother (Legge’s
Fa-hien, 68).

These places are all situated <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">within</span> the area of the sacred <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">land</span> of
Buddhism (see map opposite p. 21);—that is to say, the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">land</span> which was
the scene of the Buddha’s itineration for forty-five years—a region
about 300 miles long, by nearly 200 broad, lying in Gangetic India,
<span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">within</span> the modern provinces of Oudh and Behar (Bihar for Vihara), or the
<span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> kingdoms of Kosala and Magadha, and having ?ravasti and
Buddha-Gaya for its limit towards the north and south respectively.

It will be interesting to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">note</span> a few particulars in regard to these and
other sacred spots scattered throughout this region, in the following
order:—Kapila-vastu, Buddha-Gaya, Sarnath near Benares, Raja-g?iha,
?ravasti (often <span class="t2 t11 t15 t19 t25 t27 hoverable">written</span> ?ravasti), Vai?ali, Kau?ambi, Nalanda, Sa?ka?ya,
Sake?a (Ajudhya), Kanya-kubja (Kanauj), Pa?ali-putra (Patna), Kesariya,
Ku?i-nagara. The map opposite p. 21 will make these clear.

To begin with the Buddha’s birth-place (see p. 21).


                            _Kapila-vastu._

Kapila-vastu (in Pali, Kapila-vatthu) was <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> searched for by
archæologists in vain, but is now identified by General Sir A.
Cunningham and Mr. Carlleyle with Bhuila, a village surrounded by buried
brickwork in the Basti district under the Nepal mountains, about
twenty-five miles north-east from Faizabad, twelve north-west from
Basti, and one hundred and twenty north of Benares. Both Fa-hien (Legge,
67) and Hiouen Thsang describe the neighbouring Lumbini (Lava?i) garden,
where the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> was <span class="t9 t24 hoverable">born</span> from the right side of his mother (see p. 23,
and engraving opposite p. 477). They also mention the Arrow-fountain
where Gautama contended with others of his tribe in a shooting-match.
The legend is (p. 24) that he gained the victory by shooting an arrow
which passed through the target, buried itself in the ground, and caused
a clear spring of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> to flow forth (Legge, 65-67; Beal, ii. 23, 24).
This name ?ara-Kupa, ‘arrow-fountain,’ has now been corrupted into
Sar-Kuia (or Sar-Kuhiya), and the spot has been identified (Cunningham’s
‘Reports of Survey,’ xii. 188).

It might have been expected that so sacred a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> as Kapila-vastu—the
birth-place of <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> and the scene of his education and youthful
exploits—would have been a favourite <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> of pilgrimage for Buddhists
through all time; but we learn from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> Chinese travellers, that
even in their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> (from the fourth to the seventh century) the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span>
neighbourhood was a desert and the town in ruins (Beal, i. 50; ii. 14).
The <span class="t1 t11 t16 t20 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">reason</span> probably is that Hinduism gained the ascendancy over Buddhism
in certain localities, and that when this happened the Brahmans <span class="t2 t4 t6 t9 t18 t19 t22 hoverable">took</span>
pains to obliterate all traces of the rival creed. In later times
Muhammadan invasions contributed to the same result.


                             _Buddha-Gaya._

This was the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> where the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> obtained perfect <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> and
enlightenment after his sexennial course of fasting and meditation (see
p. 31 of this volume). It is situated six or seven miles from the town
of Gaya, and about sixty miles from Patna and Bankipur. It is of all
Buddhist sacred places the most sacred, and abounds in profoundly
interesting memorials of early Buddhism.

Of course it was only to be expected that memorial structures intended
to mark important epochs in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of the extinct Buddha, and
calculated to foster feelings of reverence in the minds of his
followers, should have been erected at this and various other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">holy</span> spots
of ground consecrated by the presence and acts of Gautama on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>
occasions. And of all such Buddhist monuments the <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> pyramidal
temple at Buddha-Gaya, which I visited in 1876 and 1884, is the most
striking and <span class="t10 t16 hoverable">full</span> of interest. Probably a monument of some <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> was
erected there not very <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> after the Buddha’s death, and Hiouen Thsang
(see p. 399) mentions the temple built there by A?oka. The temple which
I saw on the occasion of my first visit was probably not built till the
middle of the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t13 t14 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">second</span> century, but was erected on the foundation of
A?oka’s temple, the ruins of which are traceable under the present
one[190]. The materials consist of bluish bricks, plastered with lime.
Hiouen Thsang states that in his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> it had eleven stories and an
altitude of about 165 feet. It also had niches in each story, with a
golden statue of <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> in each niche. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> was crowned with the
representation of an Amalaka fruit (Emblic myrobalan) in gilt copper
(Cunningham’s Report, i. 5). The Burmese probably restored the temple
between 1035 and 1078 A.D. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Though</span> falling into decay in 1876, its
appearance struck me as exceedingly imposing,—even more so than that of
the grand pyramidal towers, built over the entrances to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> South
Indian temples[191]. The annexed engraving of this <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> monument as
it appeared in 1880, before its restoration, is from a photograph by Mr.
Beglar, <span class="t2 t5 t11 t18 t19 t23 t26 hoverable">taken</span> on the spot, and enlarged by Mr. Austen.

[Illustration: <span class="t21 hoverable">ANCIENT</span> BUDDHIST TEMPLE AT BUDDHA-GAYA, AS IT APPEARED IN
1880.]

Erected about the middle of the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t13 t14 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">second</span> century over the ruins of A?oka’s
         temple, at the spot where Gautama attained Buddhahood.

The original <span class="t24 t25 hoverable">object</span> of its erection seems to have been simply and solely
to serve as a monument, and not as a Dagaba or receptacle for relics.
Very soon, however, monuments of this <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> were made to enshrine images,
and were <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">used</span> as temples and places of worship. On inquiry I found that
the <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> image or images of Buddha, which once occupied the shrine in
the <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> Buddha-Gaya temple, had been destroyed or carried off at
different times[192], and that another stone image, believed to have
been carved in the eighth century, had been recently substituted for it.
It is remarkable that during the process of restoring the so-called
‘diamond throne,’ on which the statues were placed, a mass of fragments
of coral, sapphire, cornelian, crystal, ruby, pearl, ivory, and gold,
but no diamond, was found compacted or cemented <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> in front of
it[193].

At the back of the raised terrace which surrounded the <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> temple
was a Pipal or sacred fig-tree, fabled to be the very tree under which
Gautama sat during his course of profound meditation ending in
Buddhahood (see p. 31). Its vitality was on the wane, for its decaying
branches drooped over the parapet as if they sought, like those of a
neighbouring Banyan tree, to gain new <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> by rooting themselves in the
ground beneath. Some Buddhist pilgrims happened, at the moment of my
visit, to be worshipping at the temple, deputed by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span> of Burma to
present offerings. I observed that they had <span class="t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> packets of
gold-leaf, and had gilded the stone steps that surrounded the tree.
Having performed this act of homage, they sat near muttering their
prayer-formularies. No doubt they believed it to be the very Bodhi-tree
of Gautama’s time, the stem of which had been miraculously preserved,
though, had it been really so, the stem <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have been about
twenty-three centuries old. Considering the well-known properties of the
Pipal tree, it is possible that the worshippers were, after all, paying
honour to the descendant of the original tree, the fact, no doubt, being
that as each tree began to decay a new one was produced, by the dropping
of seeds into the old roots and the springing up of fresh scions.
Probably most of the sacred trees in the neighbourhood of Buddhist
temples throughout India, Ceylon, and Burma were originally raised from
seeds <span class="t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> from the <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> Buddha-Gaya tree.

[Illustration: <span class="t21 hoverable">ANCIENT</span> BUDDHIST TEMPLE AT BUDDHA-GAYA, AS RESTORED IN
1884.]

It is a received tradition that a shoot from this tree was <span class="t2 t5 t11 t18 t19 t23 t26 hoverable">taken</span> by the
Missionary Mahendra, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> of A?oka, in the <span class="t26 hoverable">third</span> century B.C. to Ceylon,
and planted at Anuradha-pura, where its descendant still flourishes.

When I again visited Buddha-Gaya in 1884, I found that the old pyramidal
temple had been restored according (as is conjectured) to Hiouen
Thsang’s description of the Vihara of his day.

It is said that the late Burmese government, not very <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> ago, spent
about thirty <span class="t6 hoverable">thousand</span> rupees in building a wall round the temple and
making excavations with a <span class="t25 hoverable">view</span> to its restoration. Then our government,
about 1881 or 1882, undertook the work, and I believe at least a lakh of
rupees has been spent in completing it. I give a representation of the
restored temple (as it appeared in 1884), from a photograph <span class="t2 t5 t11 t18 t19 t23 t26 hoverable">taken</span> by Mr.
Beglar, and enlarged by Mr. Austen. Its present height is 176 feet, as
it has several tiers of the usual umbrella-like ornament, tapering to a
point at the summit[194].

The reconstruction of the temple led of course to the removal of the
sacred Bodhi-tree, but an effort was made to preserve the tree by
transplanting it to a neighbouring garden. No sooner was this done than
parties of pilgrims from Burma and Ceylon, in their pious <span class="t0 t10 t11 t17 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">desire</span> to
maintain the vitality of the venerated tree, covered the stem with
gold-leaf, and, bringing Eau de Cologne and other scents, poured them
over the roots, at the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> manuring them with the contents of
boxes of sardines steeped in oil, choice biscuits, and other delicacies.
Of course, the result was the speedy destruction of the tree, root and
branch. To compensate for its loss, a new Pipal tree was planted behind
the restored temple by Sir A. Cunningham in 1885. Another near the
temple appeared to be in a flourishing condition in 1884, and I observed
that both Hindu and Buddhist pilgrims met <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> there as worshippers
of the same sacred object.

The idol-shrine, under the principal tower of the restored temple,
consists of a small vaulted stone-chamber lighted only by the door. My
first act, on arriving at Gaya in 1884, was to descend to this
interesting spot. At the further end is the principal statue of Buddha,
seated, in the ‘witness-attitude’ (see p. 480)—on an altar-like throne
having five pilasters, and supposed to represent the original
Bodhi-ma??a. The pedestal of the statue is ornamented with
diamond-shaped carvings, and sculptures of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> elephants and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span>
lions[195].

Inside the shrine, at the moment of my visit, were five Burmese pilgrims
from Mandelay. They were apparently monks, as all were habited in yellow
dresses. Each <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> bowed down before the image, with <span class="t20 hoverable">hands</span> joined in
reverence, occasionally touching the ground with his forehead, and going
through a course of prayer-repetition by help of a rosary. After
worshipping for some time, they deposited a quantity of offerings, of a
somewhat miscellaneous description, in front of the image. I noticed
among other things, rice, fruit, vegetables, flowers of the Bel-tree,
tin boxes filled with sardines, Huntley and Palmer’s biscuits, bottles
of the genuine Maria Farina’s Eau de Cologne for watering the
sacred-trees, and a large <span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span> of packets of gold-leaf. I <span class="t1 t7 t12 t29 hoverable">left</span> the
shrine for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> hours, and on returning found that the pilgrims
had crowned their act of <span class="t0 t5 t11 hoverable">worship</span> by gilding the image with the contents
of these packets, reserving a supply for covering the other images in
the vicinity of the temple. The cost of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> process must have been
considerable.

At the back of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Buddha-Gaya temple, I found a stone <span class="t2 t9 t12 t18 t29 hoverable">tablet</span> for
offerings, recently <span class="t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> and fixed horizontally in the ground by
another pilgrim who was from Colombo in Ceylon. It bore an inscription
indicating that the slab had been placed there as a votive <span class="t6 hoverable">offering</span> by a
<span class="t0 t4 t5 t10 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">person</span> calling himself Gu?a-ratna Muddali Raja of Kolamba-pur. The date
carved on it (Buddha-vasse 2427) shows that the Buddhists of Ceylon are
no believers in the researches of modern scholars. They still reckon
from B.C. 543 for the supposed Nirva?a of Buddha.

At a little distance in front of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Temple, but on the right
side, are the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> smaller temples <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Tara-devi and Vagi?vari. In the
latter is a circular stone with nine circles of complicated ornaments.
This is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> a Vajrasana, from the thunderbolt ornament in the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t13 t14 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">second</span>
circle, but it is not the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> Bodhi-ma??a.

I may mention here that a portion of the original A?oka stone-railing,
with an inscription, lotus-ornaments and carvings, was discovered in a
fair <span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> of preservation by Sir A. Cunningham, and is now to be seen
_in situ_. The Buddha’s walking <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> was unearthed by Mr. Beglar. The
massive new brick railing which now encloses the temple has been <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span>
constructed after an <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> pattern, and ornamented with numerous
carvings representing scenes in the lives of the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> (p. 111). The
paved quadrangle sets the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> off to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> advantage. Indeed, the
present appearance of the square and the sacred area of ground
adjoining—strewn with ruins of the Stupas erected by A?oka and
others—and according to the legend by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> Indra and Brahma—is one
of the most striking sights in all India, and must be seen to be
appreciated.

In truth, Buddha-Gaya is a <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of Buddhist Jerusalem, abounding in
associations of thrilling interest, not only to the followers of Buddha,
but to all who see in that spot the central focus whence radiated a
system which for centuries has permeated the religious <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> of the
most populous regions of Eastern Asia, and influenced the creed of a
majority of the <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> race.

Another remarkable characteristic of this spot is that it was converted
into a <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of Buddhist Necropolis, teeming with the remains of
generations of the Buddha’s adherents contained in relic-receptacles
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Stupas (pp. 503-506), some of which have been <span class="t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> to light,
while countless others still remain to be unearthed.

The <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> was that immense numbers of pilgrims from all parts of India
and the outlying countries once thronged in crowds to Buddha-Gaya, and
nearly every pilgrim <span class="t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> with him a Stupa or relic-shrine of some
kind, according to his means, and deposited it as a votive <span class="t6 hoverable">offering</span> in
this hallowed region, either with the <span class="t24 t25 hoverable">object</span> of acquiring religious
merit for himself, or of promoting the welfare of the deceased in other
states of being. Often it was inscribed with the usual Buddhist formula,
Ye Dharma, etc. (see p. 104), and sometimes bore a date and the name of
the reigning king. Generally the votive Stupa contained the relics of
deceased relatives—perhaps the ashes of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">father</span> or mother, or pieces of
bone, or a small fragment of a single bone placed in an earthen vessel
or casket of some other material, and buried in the interior of the
Stupa.

Relics, however, were not always forthcoming, and so the votive Stupas
were frequently mere cenotaphs or models in clay or stone of actual
Stupas erected in other places. Often they were beautifully carved and
ornamented with rows on rows of images of the Buddha. I obtained some
beautiful specimens for the Indian Institute at Oxford, a drawing of one
of which will be given (see p. 505). Layers on layers of these have been
exhumed during the process of the excavations. They are of every variety
of size, from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> inches to several feet high, and of every variety of
material, from terra cotta and clay turned on a potter’s wheel to
elaborately sculptured brick and stone. All the upper layers are now
gone (those made of clay and pottery having naturally crumbled to
pieces), but the lowest are still _in situ_, and furnish specimens of
all ages from the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t13 t14 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">second</span> century to the tenth or twelfth. I noticed
hundreds lying about on the ground in 1884.

A sacred tank, mentioned by Hiouen Thsang, is situated <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> or four
hundred yards to the <span class="t1 t7 t12 t29 hoverable">left</span> of the Buddha-Gaya temple. I found, on
visiting it, that this hallowed pool is quite as much venerated by
Hindus as by pilgrims from Buddhist countries.

Indeed, I was much struck by the evidence which Buddha-Gaya affords of
the inter-relationship between Buddhism and Hinduism—especially that
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of the latter <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Vaish?avism. For instance, on one side of the
temple I noticed the tombs of the Mahants, or Heads of the neighbouring
Hindu monastery, who are buried there in a sitting posture. Near these
again are shrines of the five Pa??ava heroes (who <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> of the
five Buddhas), and a shrine containing the supposed impression of the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> feet of Vish?u. The upper portion of a small Buddhist Stupa has been
sawn off and inverted[196], and Vish?u’s footsteps carved on the smooth
surface. This certainly symbolizes in a remarkable manner the merging of
Buddhism in Vaish?avism, and bears out Dr. Sachau’s assertion that in
Alberuni’s <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> Vish?u-worship was dominant in India.

Then, again, on the right of the entrance to the principal temple is a
raised platform of earth, on which are images of Vish?u, ?iva, Parvati,
and Ga?e?a. Here I saw a ?raddha ceremony[197], in the act of being
performed by some Hindus—just arrived from the neighbouring town of
Gaya. They were repeating their mantras, <span class="t6 hoverable">offering</span> their Pi??as, and
putting the finishing stroke to the funeral services (previously
performed by them at the Vish?u-pad temple at Gaya), under the shadow of
a Pipal tree, held as sacred by them as by Buddhists.

century:—

  Going south-west from Mount Pragbodhi, we came to the Bodhi-tree. It
  is surrounded by a brick wall, and is about 500 paces round. <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">Within</span>

In the middle of the
  enclosure is the Bodhi-tree, under which is the diamond throne <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span>
  Bodhi-ma??a. On this the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> sat and attained the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">holy</span> path of

  In old days, when <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> was alive, the Bodhi-tree—which is a Pippala
  or sacred fig-tree—was several hundred feet high. Although it has
  often been injured by cutting, it is still forty or fifty feet high.
  The leaves never wither either in winter or summer, but always remain
  shining and glistening, except on every successive Nirva?a-day, when
  the leaves fade, and then in a moment revive as before. On this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span>

  bathe the roots with scented <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> and perfumed milk. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span> A?oka,

  as ever.

  To the east of the Bodhi-tree, there is a Vihara about 160 or 170 feet
  high, built of blue tiles covered with chunam; all the niches in the
  different stories holding golden figures. The four sides of the
  building are covered with ornamental work. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> is surmounted by
  a gilded copper Amalaka fruit. To the right and <span class="t1 t7 t12 t29 hoverable">left</span> of the gate are
  niches; in the <span class="t1 t7 t12 t29 hoverable">left</span> is a figure of Avalokite?vara Bodhi-sattva and in
  the right a figure of Maitreya. On the site of the present Vihara,
  A?oka at first built a small Vihara. Afterwards a Brahman, who became
  a convert to Buddhism, reconstructed it on a larger scale.

  To the north of the Bodhi-tree is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> where <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> walked up and
  down, about 70 paces or so long. When he had obtained enlightenment,
  he remained perfectly quiet for seven days. Then rising, he walked up
  and down during seven <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">days</span> to the north of the tree. Not far to the
  south of the tree is a Stupa about 100 feet high, built by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span> A?oka.
  To the east of the tree is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> (marked by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> Stupas) where Mara
  tempted Gautama to become a Universal Monarch. To the north-west is a
  Vihara in which is an image of Ka?yapa Buddha, noted for its
  miraculous qualities. Occasionally it emits a glorious light, and the
  old records say, that if a man, actuated by sincere faith, walks round
  it seven times, he obtains the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of knowing the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> and
  condition of his previous births. Outside the south gate is a large
  tank, about 700 paces round, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> of which is clear and pure as a
  mirror. To the east of this is the lake of the Snake-king, Mucalinda.
  On the west bank is a small Vihara. Formerly, when Tathagata acquired
  complete enlightenment, he sat here for seven <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">days</span> in perfect
  composure, and ecstatic contemplation, while Mucalinda protected him
  with his folds wound seven times round his body. (Compare the
  frontispiece.)

  By the side of the river, not far off, is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> where <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span>
  received the rice-milk, and where <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> merchants offered some
  wheat-flour and honey from their travelling-store (p. 40 of this
  volume).

  Near this a Stupa marks the spot where the four Kings presented <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span>
  with four golden dishes. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> declined such costly offerings. Then
  the four Kings, casting away the golden vessels, offered silver ones;
  and afterwards vessels of crystal, lapis-lazuli, cornelian, amber,
  ruby, and so on in succession; but the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">World</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> accept
  none of them. Lastly, the four Kings offered stone vessels.

  Near this spot the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> worked various wonders to convert those who
  were capable of conversion. For example, it was here that the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span>
  overcame the fiery snake-demon (see p. 46 of this volume). In the
  middle of the night the Naga vomited forth <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> and smoke, and the
  chamber seemed to be filled with fiery flames; but the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> having
  forced the fiery dragon into his alms-bowl, came forth next <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span>
  holding it in his hand, and showed it to the unbelievers.

  To the south of Mucalinda’s tank is a Stupa, which indicates the spot
  where Ka?yapa, having embarked in a boat to save <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> during an
  inundation, saw the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">World</span> walking on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> as on land.


                        _Sarnath near Benares._

The <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">city</span> of Benares (Banaras, properly Vara?asi) is the most sacred

Buddhism. For it was from this centre that the stream of Buddhist
teaching first flowed, and in the <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">days</span> of A?oka and of his immediate
successors, Buddhism must have vied with Brahmanism in the <span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span> of its
shrines and sacred objects collected there.

We have already seen that memorial Stupas and temples, not intended to
contain relics, were reared at various <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">holy</span> spots of ground, consecrated
by the presence of Gautama on special occasions. The immense ruined
Stupa—once a tower-like monument—at a spot now <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Sarnath

Benares, is a memorial of this kind. It is all that remains of the
celebrated structure erected at the spot in the M?iga-dava or deer-park,
once <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Isi-patana (for Sansk?it ?ishi-patana), where Gautama first
turned the wheel of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Law</span> (Dharma-cakra)—that is, where he preached
his first sermon (p. 42). It was to this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> that Buddhist pilgrims
once flocked, and here vast numbers of votive relic-shrines and Stupas
were deposited, as at Buddha-Gaya.

I visited this <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> ruin, in company with the late Mr. Sherring, in
1876, and enjoyed the advantage of his guidance in inspecting it, as
<span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as all that remains of the monastic buildings and other adjacent
ruins, including the octagonal tower <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Chaukandi, about half a mile
distant. In his <span class="t6 t8 t10 t11 t16 t20 t21 t27 t28 hoverable">book</span> on Benares, Mr. Sherring has followed General Sir
A. Cunningham, who describes the principal monument—now of a bee-hive
shape, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Dhamek[200]—as 93 feet in diameter at the base, 292
feet in circumference, and 128 feet above the general level of the soil.
The lower part—to a height of 43 feet—is built of stone, and all the
upper part of bricks. There are eight projecting faces with empty
niches, which once held statues.

An old <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> who was in charge of the ruins when we examined them, lighted
a candle, and <span class="t2 t4 t6 t9 t18 t19 t22 hoverable">took</span> us into the horizontal tunnel-like gallery which the
General had excavated some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> before, in the hope that relics or
memorials of some <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> might be found buried in the interior. A shaft or
<span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> had been previously sunk from the summit, and at the depth of 10½
feet a slab was discovered, inscribed with the well-known Buddhist
formula ‘Ye dharma,’ etc. (p. 104); but the search for relics proved
unsuccessful. The Stupa, in fact, turned out to be merely memorial, like
that at Buddha-Gaya.

Probably some monumental Stupa existed here from the earliest times, and
certainly from A?oka’s time. The present Stupa was seen by Hiouen
Thsang, who has described it in rather a confused manner (Beal, ii. 45).
Hence it must be as old as about the ninth century. Fa-hien saw a Stupa
of some <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> there in the fifth century (p. 387).

About fifty yards from the Stupa, Sir A. Cunningham found the
interesting sculpture given at p. 477.


                             _Raja-g?iha._

Raja-g?iha (Pali, Raja-gaha) is the modern Raj-gir. The old <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">city</span> had the
epithet Giri-vraja, ‘surrounded by hills[201].’ It was the first
metropolis or mother-city of Buddhism, and the original capital of the
powerful kingdom of Magadha, when under the rule of the Kings Bimbi-sara
(p. 48) and his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> Ajata-?atru, who were contemporaries and friends of
Gautama, and converted by him to Buddhism[202]. The sacred character of
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> is attested by the ruins of vast numbers of Buddhist Stupas
and Viharas which once existed here. Unhappily Brahmans and Musalmans
have <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">used</span> the materials for their temples, tombs, and mosques.

It was here that Gautama first studied under the Brahmans A?ara and
Uddaka (p. 29), and here he first imbibed the philosophical ideas which
afterwards coloured his teaching. It is not surprising, therefore, that
at a later period of his career he was fond of returning to Raja-g?iha
for retirement during Vassa; his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> favourite resorts[203] being the

(G?idhra-ku?a, Legge’s Fa-hien, 81, 83), both in the neighbourhood of
the city.

It was here, too, that several interesting incidents in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of
<span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> occurred. For example, it was here in a cavern that the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span>
often meditated. It was here that he often preached and taught; and it
was here, or in the neighbourhood of the city, that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">god</span> ?akra
(Indra) once appeared to Buddha, bringing a musician from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heaven</span> to
entertain him, and afterwards testing his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> by forty-two
questions. These the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">god</span> traced with his finger on the rock, and the
impression of them, according to Fa-hien, was to be seen there in his
time, and a monastery was built on the spot. With reference to this
legend we may <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">note</span> that the answers to the forty-two questions are
supposed to be contained in a celebrated Tibetan <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the
‘Forty-two points on which the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> gave instruction[204]’, the
importance of which is proved by its being translated into several
languages.

It was in this neighbourhood, too, that Buddha’s <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> chief
disciples—?ariputra and Maudgalyayana (Pali, Moggallana, p. 47)—had
their noted meeting with A?vajit (Pali, Assaji), already mentioned (p.
104). Here, also, a Jaina ascetic made a pit of <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> and poisoned the
rice, and then invited <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> to eat. Lastly, it was here that many of
Deva-datta’s plots against the Buddha’s <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> (see p. 52) were carried
on. The story of these is so interesting that I abridge it from the
Sacred Books of the East (vol. xx. p. 238):—

  Now at that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> the Venerable One was seated preaching the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Law</span> and
  surrounded by a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> multitude, including the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> and his retinue.
  And Deva-datta rose from his seat, and said, ‘The Venerable One is now
  aged, he has accomplished a <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> journey, and his term of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> is
  nearly run. Let the Venerable One now dwell at ease and give up the
  Sa?gha to me, I will be its leader.’ Then said the Buddha, ‘I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span>
  not give over the Sa?gha, even to Sariputta and Moggallana; how much
  less then to so evil-living a <span class="t0 t4 t5 t10 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">person</span> as you.’

  Then Deva-datta thought: ‘The Venerable One denies me before the king,
  and calls me “evil-living,” and exalts Sariputta and Moggallana.’ With
  these thoughts in his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> he departed, angry and displeased, and <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span>
  to Ajata-sattu and said, ‘Do you, prince, kill your father, and become
  Raja; and I will kill the Venerable One and become the Buddha.’ And
  prince Ajata-sattu, taking a dagger, entered his royal father’s
  chamber. And the Raja Bimbi-sara said, ‘Why do you want to kill me, O
  prince? if you want the kingdom, let it be thine.’ And he handed it
  over to Ajata-sattu. Then Deva-datta said, ‘Give orders, O king, to
  your men, that I may deprive the Samana Gotama of life.’ And
  Ajata-sattu did so. Then sixteen <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> were sent to kill Gotama. They
  went, and returned and said, ‘We cannot kill him. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Great</span> is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span>
  of the Venerable One.’

  Next Deva-datta climbed up the Vulture’s Peak, and hurled down a
  mighty rock on the Venerable One. But <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> mountain peaks came <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span>
  and stopped that rock. [Fa-hien says that it hurt one of his toes.
  Legge, p. 83.] Now at that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> there was at Raja-g?iha an elephant
  named Nalagiri, fierce and a man-slayer. And Deva-datta caused the
  elephant to be let loose against Gotama. But the Venerable One infused
  a <span class="t0 t1 t7 t12 t13 t14 t17 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">sense</span> of <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> into the elephant. And the elephant extended his trunk
  and <span class="t2 t4 t6 t9 t18 t19 t22 hoverable">took</span> up the dust from off the feet of the Venerable One and
  sprinkled it over his own head, and retired bowing backwards, gazing
  <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the Venerable One.

It may be noted here that the hell to which Deva-datta was condemned for
his attempts <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the Buddha’s life, is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> described by Burmese
authorities:—

  The impious Deva-datta, a cousin and brother-in-law of the Buddha,
  suffers terrible punishment in Hell. His feet are sunk ankle-deep in
  burning marl. His <span class="t1 t4 t9 t16 hoverable">head</span> is incased with a red hot metal cap down to the
  lobe of the ears. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Two</span> large red-hot bars transfix him from back to
  front, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> horizontally from right to left, and one impales him from
  <span class="t1 t4 t9 t16 hoverable">head</span> to foot. (Shway Yoe’s ‘Burman,’ i. 121.)

It should be mentioned in connexion with Raja-g?iha that Ajata-?atru
built a grand Stupa there, over a portion of the Buddha’s ashes, soon
after his cremation.

Another <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> which enhances the interest of this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> is the
propinquity of the celebrated Satta-pa??i cave (p. 55), where the
Buddhist brotherhood first assembled after their leader’s death.


                              _?ravasti._

?ravasti (Pali, Savatthi), sometimes spelt ?ravasti, has been identified
by General Cunningham with a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> now <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Sahet-Mahet, about
fifty-eight miles north of Ajudhya in Oudh. The town is said to derive
its name from the <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> that it was built by a certain <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span> ?ravasta.
Other native authorities derive it from a ?ishi named Savattha, who is
said to have resided there. It was certainly the <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> capital of
Kosala (Oudh), and was ruled over by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span> Prasena-jit (Pali, Pasenadi),
who was Gautama’s contemporary. Moreover, it was the Buddha’s favourite
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> of retreat[205] during the rainy seasons (p. 48 of this volume),
about half of his Vassas having been spent there[206] in the Jeta-vana
monastery built for him by the wealthy merchant Anatha-pi??ika
(Anepidu), sometimes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Su-datta.

Doubtless on this <span class="t1 t11 t12 t13 t16 t18 t21 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> ?ravasti was once much resorted to by the
Buddha’s followers, and ultimately became an important seat of Buddhist
learning.

The celebrated monastery, the ruins of which still exist, was erected in
the garden (vana) of Prince Jeta, who parted with the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">land</span> to Su-datta
on condition that he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> cover it with gold coins. This was done, till
eighteen krores of coins had been spread out like a pavement on the
ground. Both Fa-hien and Hiouen Thsang mention this incident, and the
former states that the monastery was seven stories high[207]. The
pavement of coins is represented in one of the sculptures belonging to
the Stupa of Bharhut (Cunningham, pp. 84-87), as <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as on one of the
pillars of A?oka’s railing at Buddha-Gaya.

?ravasti was the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> where, according to Fa-hien, the first
sandal-wood image of <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> was <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> up in a monastery by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span>
Prasena-jit (see p. 471)[208]. A colossal erect figure of the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> was
found here in a temple excavated by Sir A. Cunningham, but this was of
stone.

With regard to the celebrated sandal-wood image, Fa-hien (p. 57) relates
a strange legend of its preservation by a miracle:—

  ‘The kings and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> of the countries around vied with one another in
  their offerings (to the image). Hanging up about it silken canopies,
  scattering flowers, burning incense, and lighting lamps. It happened
  that a rat, carrying in its mouth the wick of a lamp, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> one of the
  canopies on fire, which caught the Vihara, and the seven stories were
  all consumed. The kings and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> were all very sad, supposing that
  the sandal-wood image had been burned; but lo! when a small Vihara to
  the east was opened, there was seen the original image!’

Fa-hien goes on to describe another miracle:—

  ‘To the north-west of the Vihara there is a grove <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> “The getting
  of Eyes.” Formerly there were five hundred blind men, who lived here;
  <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> preached his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Law</span> to them, and they all got back their eyesight.
  <span class="t10 t16 hoverable">Full</span> of joy they stuck their staves in the earth, and did reverence.
  The staves immediately began to grow, and formed a grove’ (Legge, pp.
  58, 59).

Hiouen Thsang states that in his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> the towns and monasteries about
?ravasti were mostly in ruins. He, too, gives an interesting <span class="t1 t11 t12 t13 t16 t18 t21 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of
a miraculous incident which occurred there:—

  To the north-east of the Jeta-vana garden is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> where the
  <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> washed a sick Monk, who lived apart by himself in a solitary
  place. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">World</span> seeing him inquired, ‘What is your
  affliction?’ He answered, ‘In former days, my disposition being a
  careless one, I never looked on any sick <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> with pity, and now when I
  am sick, no one looks on me.’ Thereupon the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> said to him, ‘My
  son! I will look on you,’ and touching him with his hand, he healed
  the sickness. Then leading him forth, he washed his body, and gave him
  new clothes, and said, ‘From this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> forward be diligent and exert
  yourself.’ Hearing this, the penitent monk, moved by gratitude and
  filled with joy, followed the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> and became his disciple. (Founded
  on Beal, ii. 5, abridged.)


                               _Vai?ali._

Vai?ali (in Pali Vesali, now Besarh) lies twenty miles north of
Haji-pur, on the <span class="t1 t7 t12 t29 hoverable">left</span> bank of the Ganges, and twenty-seven north-east of
Patna. This town (the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">city</span> of the Licchavis) is celebrated as the scene
of the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t13 t14 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">second</span> Council (p. 57). Near it, at a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Bakhra, is a
celebrated <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> pillar surmounted by a lion (see Cunningham, i. 59).
Vai?ali, however, is chiefly noted as one of the places where Gautama
often preached and taught, and where he stopped on his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> to Kusinara,

by Fa-hien as double-galleried, and in a garden presented to him by the
courtesan Amba-pali, whom he converted and induced to live a virtuous
life. He also resided for the fifth year of his teaching in a building
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the Ku?agara[209] hall.

Hiouen Thsang speaks of the town and of the objects of interest round it
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> (Beal, ii. 66-75):—

  Both heretics and believers are found here living together. There are
  several hundred monasteries (Sa?gharamas) which are mostly
  dilapidated. There are also several Deva temples, occupied by
  sectaries of different kinds. The followers of the Nirgranthas (i. e.
  of the Jains) are very numerous.

  To the north is a Stupa which indicates the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> where Tathagata
  stopped and <span class="t2 t4 t6 t9 t18 t19 t22 hoverable">took</span> leave of the Licchavis, on his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> to Ku?i-nagara to
  die. Wishing him to quit the world, Mara (compare p. 41) came to
  <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> and said, ‘You have now dwelt sufficiently <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> in the world.
  Those whom you have saved from the circling streams of transmigration
  are as numerous as the sand.’ The <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> replied, ‘No, those who are
  saved are as the grains of dust on my nail; those who are not saved
  are like the grains of dust on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> earth. Nevertheless, after

  departed.

  Both <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">within</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">city</span> of Vai?ali and all round it, the
  sacred vestiges are so numerous, that it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be difficult to recount
  them all. To the north-west is a Stupa at the spot where <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> dwelt
  when he recited the history of his former birth (Jataka) as a
  Cakra-vartin or Universal Monarch (compare p. 423) possessed of the
  seven treasures. To the south-east is a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Stupa, marking the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span>
  where the convocation of the seven hundred sages and saints was held,
  one hundred and ten <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> after the Nirva?a of Buddha, to compel the
  monks who had broken the laws of <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> to obey them.

It appears that the Licchavis of Vai?ali obtained a large quantity of
the relics of the Buddha’s body, and built a Stupa over them.

According to Fa-hien they also erected a Stupa over half the relics of
the burnt <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> of Ananda (see p. 47 of this volume), the other being
deposited near Raja-g?iha. His narrative runs as follows:—

  When Ananda was going from Magadha to Vai?ali, wishing his
  Pari-nirva?a to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> there, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> Ajata-?atru <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t18 hoverable">heard</span> of his
  intention, and <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> out with his retinue to follow him.

  The Licchavis, too, when they <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t18 hoverable">heard</span> that Ananda was coming to their
  city, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> out to meet him.

  at the river, and Ananda, thinking to himself that he ought to please
  both, burnt his own <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> in the middle of the river, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> attained
  Pari-nirva?a in a fiery ecstasy of Samadhi. Then his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> was divided
  into two, so that each got one half as a sacred relic (Legge, pp.
  75-77).


                              _Kau?ambi._

Kau?ambi (in Pali Kosambi), now Kosam[210], on the river Jumna, about
thirty miles from Allahabad, was once a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> hallowed by many
Brahmanical associations, and is mentioned in the Ramaya?a. It was the
capital of the Kau?amba country, and is said to have been founded by
Ku?amba, tenth in descent from Pururavas. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Without</span> doubt it was one of
the most <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> cities of India. It was also the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">city</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span> Udayana,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> story is alluded to by the greatest of all Sanskrit poets,
Kali-dasa, in his ‘Cloud-Messenger[211].’ Furthermore, Kau?ambi is the
<span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">city</span> in which the scene of the Sansk?it drama Ratnavali was laid[212].

The <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> resided there in the sixth and ninth <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> of his Buddhahood,
and probably visited the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> at other times. This was the chief cause
of its reputation in connexion with Buddhism. But it also derived its
sacred character from the <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> that it contained the celebrated
sandal-wood image[213] of the Buddha, believed to have been carved
during his life-time, by a sculptor sent by Moggallana (see last line,
p. 414) at <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span> Udayana’s request, to the Trayastri??a heaven, when the
<span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> was there preaching the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Law</span> to his mother (see p. 207).

In a village near at <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> Sir A. Cunningham (i. 308) found <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span>
sculptured pillars, and the pedestal of a statue inscribed with the ‘Ye
dharma’ formula (see p. 104). A <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> monolith was also discovered
there. In Fa-hien’s <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> a Vihara existed at the spot where the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span>
had explained the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Law</span> (Legge, p. 96). Hiouen Thsang mentions that a
lofty Stupa, 200 feet high, was erected by A?oka near at hand.

There was also a cavern in which the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> had <span class="t1 t7 t12 t29 hoverable">left</span> his shadow
impressed on the rock. He also speaks of ten monasteries all in ruins.


                               _Nalanda._

Nalanda[214] was the greatest seat of Buddhist learning in India. It has
been identified by Sir A. Cunningham with the village of Baragaon, about
seven miles north of Raja-g?iha, about thirty miles south-east of the
modern Patna, and about forty miles from Buddha-Gaya. Sir Alexander
states that Baragaon possesses immense ruins and more numerous specimens
of sculpture than any other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> visited by him. According to Hiouen
Thsang, the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> preached the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Law</span> there for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> months. The vast
extent and importance of the monastery (Sa?gharama) or monasteries at
Nalanda have been already alluded to (p. 169). Fa-hien, however, does
not mention them, which seems to indicate that they were built
subsequently to A.D. 425. Hiouen Thsang, who travelled in the seventh
century, is said to have resided there for five <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> as a student. Ten
<span class="t6 hoverable">thousand</span> monks, renowned for their learning, lived and studied in six
magnificent buildings. The following is an extract from the later
Chinese traveller’s description of it (Beal, ii. 70):—

  The monks of Nalanda, to the <span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span> of several thousands, are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> of
  the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t22 t23 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">highest</span> ability. Their conduct is pure and unblamable, although
  the rules of the monastery are severe. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> is not sufficient for
  asking and answering profound questions. From morning till night the
  monks engage in discussion; the old and the young mutually helping one
  another. Those who cannot discuss questions out of the Tripi?aka are
  little esteemed, and are obliged to hide themselves for shame. Hence
  learned <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> from different cities come here in multitudes to settle
  their doubts; and thence the streams of their <span class="t7 t8 t12 hoverable">wisdom</span> spread far and
  wide. For this <span class="t1 t11 t16 t20 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">reason</span> some persons usurp the name of Nalanda students,
  and in going to and fro receive honour in consequence.

  If <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> from other quarters <span class="t0 t10 t11 t17 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">desire</span> to enter and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> part in the
  discussions, the keeper of the gate proposes some hard questions;
  those who are unable to answer have to retire. One must have studied
  deeply both old and new books, before gaining admission. Those
  students who come as strangers, have to show their ability by hard
  discussion; those who fail compared with those who succeed are as
  seven or eight to ten.


                              _Sa?ka?ya._

Sa?ka?ya, now <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Sa?kisa, about fifty miles north-west of Kanouj,
was identified by Sir A. Cunningham in 1842. It was evidently once a
large town with many remarkable monuments, and ought to be reckoned
among the most sacred places of Buddhism. Hiouen Thsang describes it
under the name Kie-pi-tha (Kapitha).

It is said that the Buddha’s mother died seven <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">days</span> after his birth (see
p. 24 of this volume), and was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> deprived of the advantage of hearing

ascended by his own supernatural <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> steps to the

transported, and there recited the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Law</span> for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> months for her benefit.
His return to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> seems to have been a more difficult matter; for his
descent was not effected <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> the help of a ladder with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span>

Fa-hien describes this miraculous incident in the following manner
(Legge, 48, abridged):—

  Sa?ka?ya is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> where <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> came down after ascending to the
  Trayastri??a heaven, and there preaching his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Law</span> for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> months for
  his mother’s benefit. <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> had ascended there by his supernatural
  power, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of his disciples; but seven <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">days</span> before
  his return, Anuruddha, by his own supernatural vision, saw him in
  heaven, and requested Moggallana (see p. 47 of this volume) to ascend
  to Indra’s <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heaven</span> to inquire after ‘the World-honoured one.’
  Moggallana did so, and returned with the information that in seven
  <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">days</span> the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> return. Then the kings of eight countries with
  their people, not having seen <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> for a <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> time, were all eagerly
  looking up for him to return. But the female mendicant Utpala[215]
  <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> in her heart, ‘To-day, the kings, with their ministers and
  people, are all going to meet Buddha. I am but a woman; how shall I
  succeed in being the first to see him?’ Then Buddha, by his
  supernatural power, changed her into the appearance of a Universal
  Emperor, so that she was the foremost of all to meet and to do
  reverence to him.

  At his descent <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> flights of steps were created. <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> descended
  on the middle flight, composed of the seven precious substances;
  Maha-Brahma, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> of the Brahma heavens (see p. 211 of this volume),
  came down by a flight of silver steps on the right side, and ?akra
  (Indra), <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">lord</span> of the thirty-three divinities (p. 207), descended by
  steps of gold on the <span class="t1 t7 t12 t29 hoverable">left</span> side, holding a canopy made of the seven
  precious substances. An innumerable multitude of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> followed. No
  sooner had the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> come down than all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> flights disappeared in
  the ground, except seven steps, which continued to be visible.

  Afterwards <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span> A?oka, being eager to ascertain where their ends
  rested, sent <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> to <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> out by digging. They dug down till they
  reached a yellow spring, but could not discover the bottom of the
  steps. Hence the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> felt an increase of devotion, and built a Vihara
  over the steps, with a standing image of <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> sixteen cubits high.
  Behind the Vihara he erected a stone pillar, about fifty cubits high,
  with a lion on the top of it. A dispute arose between some heretics
  and the Buddhist monks about the ownership of the place, and the
  former agreed to give up their claim if any supernatural sign
  occurred; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> which the lion on the column gave a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> roar.

Fa-hien adds that a Stupa was erected on the spot where <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span>
descended; another where the female mendicant caught the first sight of
<span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> at his descent.

The basement of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span> A?oka’s pillar was found by General Cunningham in
1876. On a previous occasion he discovered the capital of the <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span>
pillar surmounted by an elephant, which may have been mistaken by
Fa-hien for a lion (see Cunningham, i. 274).

Hiouen Thsang, in his <span class="t1 t11 t12 t13 t16 t18 t21 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> ladders (Beal, i. 202), says
that they were arranged side by side from north to south, so that those
who descended might have their faces to the east, and that the flight by
which Indra descended was of crystal (not of gold), while that <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">used</span> by
Brahma was of silver, and the Buddha’s steps were of gold (or of the
seven precious substances, of which gold was one). This indicated the
superiority of <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> over the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> who accompanied him.

In harmony with these ideas Indra and Brahma are sometimes represented
in Buddhistic sculptures standing one on each side of the Buddha, and
protecting him. They were also present at his birth (see p. 483 and
engraving opposite p. 477).

Hiouen Thsang adds that some centuries before his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> the ladders still
existed in their original position; but, when he visited the spot, they
had sunk into the earth, and disappeared. Sa?ka?ya, however, was still
much frequented. A magnificent image of the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> was preserved in a
large monastery there, and 1000 priests were studying the doctrines of
the Sammatiya, a school of the Hina-yana, in four monasteries.
Furthermore, many ‘myriads’ of pious laymen lived in the neighbourhood.

The story of Buddha’s descent from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heaven</span> by help of golden steps is
commonly believed both in Ceylon and Burma to the present day. The
legend, as current in Ceylon, is given by Spence Hardy (Manual, p. 311).

It appears that when <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> was about to return to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">god</span>
Indra’s heaven, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">god</span> reflected that, although <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> had ascended in
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> steps, his descent ought to be celebrated ‘with special honours.’
He <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> caused a ladder of gold to extend from the Mountain Meru
(see p. 206 of the present Lectures) to Sa?ka?ya, 80,000 Yojanas[216] in
length. The steps were alternately of gold, silver, coral, ruby, emerald
and other gems. At the right side of the ladder he created another, also
of gold, by which Indra, blowing the conch, descended, accompanied by
his own gods; and on the <span class="t1 t7 t12 t29 hoverable">left</span> another ladder of silver, by which Brahma
and the Brahma <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> (p. 210) descended, holding umbrellas over the
Buddha. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> flights of steps appeared to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span>
like <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> rainbows. When <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> commenced his descent all the worlds
were illuminated by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> from his body.

With this extravagant myth—believed in as a historical <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> by most
Buddhists—we may contrast the simple narrative of Jacob’s dream in
Genesis xxviii.

Nevertheless the legend is curious, and I was greatly pleased by
discovering in the Indian Section of the South Kensington Museum, a
small bronze model of the triple ladder, lately dug up at Moulmein. Mr.
Purdon Clarke, C.I.E., the present Keeper, kindly had the model
photographed, and presented me with a drawing of it. This I have had
engraved, and here give.

[Illustration: ]

It will be observed that an image of the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> is represented above the
ladder, as if seated in Indra’s heaven, and as if engaged in the act of
teaching there; while the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> is typically represented below in the
shape of a square platform, with four small Buddhist temples, one at
each of the four quarters of the compass (compare p. 85).

A ruder representation of the ladder occurs in the sculptures of the
Bharhut Stupa (Cunningham, p. 92). The General found an imperfect
representation of it carved in soap-stone at Sa?kisa in 1876 (Report,
xi. 26).


                               _Saketa._

Saketa is a name of the <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">city</span> Ayodhya (now Ajudhya) described in
Valmiki’s <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> epic the Ramayan?a, and believed to have been founded by
Manu, the progenitor of the <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> race. This renowned city, which was a
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> centre of Brahmanism, was also, no doubt, at one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> a
considerable centre of Buddhism. At all events, the identification of
certain Buddhist sites there has been made clear by Sir A. Cunningham,
who considers Saketa to be the same as the Pi-so-kia (Vi?akha) of Hiouen
Thsang and the Sha-che or Sha-khe of Fa-hien. The former found twenty
monasteries there, and 3000 priests studying the Little Vehicle
according to the Sammatiya school; also fifty Deva temples and very many
heretics.

In one of the monasteries resided the Arhat Deva-?arma, who wrote a
treatise <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the Vijñana-kaya-?astra in defence of the doctrine of
the non-existence of any Ego or personal self. A Stupa, 200 feet high,
was built by A?oka in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> where <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> is supposed to have
preached and taught during six years.

Both Fa-hien and Hiouen Thsang mention the legend that he one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> threw
on the ground a twig he had <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">used</span> to clean his teeth (danta-kash?ha),
which sprouted and grew into a miraculous tree seven cubits high, at
which height it always remained. The Brahmans became jealous of the
miracle and sometimes cut the tree down, sometimes uprooted it, but it
always grew again and remained at the same height. Here also is the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> where the four Buddhas (p. 400) walked and sat (Legge, pp. 54, 55;
Beal, i. 240).


                        _Kanya-kubja (Kanouj)._

Kanya-kubja[217] is the Sansk?it name for the <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">city</span> of Kanouj;
(often spelt Kanoj), once the capital of Northern India, and said to be
the oldest <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">city</span> in India, next to Ayodhya.

When Hiouen Thsang visited this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> it was the capital of the
celebrated monarch Harsha-vardhana, also <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> ?iladitya (see p. 167 of
this volume), <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> kingdom extended from Kashmir to Assam and from the
river Narbada to Nepal. When he carried off a tooth-relic of the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span>
from Kashmir, his procession back to his capital was attended by a large
<span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span> of tributary kings. Hiouen Thsang, in describing the piety of
this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> monarch, says of him, that ‘he sought to plant the tree of
religious merit to such an extent that he forgot to sleep and to eat.’
He goes on to <span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> as follows:—

  <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span> ?iladitya forbade the slaughter of any living <span class="t3 t5 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">thing</span> as <span class="t0 t14 t23 t24 hoverable">food</span> on
  pain of death. He built several <span class="t6 hoverable">thousand</span> Stupas, each about 100 feet
  high. Then in all the highways of the towns and villages throughout
  India he erected hospices, and stationed physicians there with
  medicines for travellers and the poor persons round about. On all
  spots where there were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">holy</span> traces of Buddha, he built monasteries.
  Once in five <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> he held the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> assembly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Moksha. Then
  every year he assembled the monks, and bestowed on them the four kinds
  of alms (food, drink, medicine, clothing). He ordered them to carry on
  discussions, and himself judged of their arguments. He rewarded the
  <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> and punished the wicked. He promoted the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> of talent, and
  degraded <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> men. Wherever he moved he dwelt in a travelling-palace,
  and provided choice meats for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> of all sorts of religion. Of these
  the Buddhist priests <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be perhaps a thousand; the Brahmans five
  hundred[218]. He divided each <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> into <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> portions. During the
  first he occupied himself on matters of government; during the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t13 t14 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">second</span>
  he practised himself in religious devotion (Beal, i. 214).

Notwithstanding Hiouen Thsang’s description of various Stupas,
monasteries and monuments seen by him, General Sir A. Cunningham was not
able to identify any of the existing ruins in the neighbourhood of
Kanouj, ‘so completely has almost every trace of Hindu occupation been
obliterated by the Musalmans’ (Report, i. 284).

Fa-hien mentions a Stupa near the town, built on the spot where the
<span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> preached a discourse on ‘the bitterness and vanity of life,’
comparing it to ‘a bubble or foam on water’ (Legge, 54).


                            _Pa?ali-putra._

Pa?ali-putra (now Patna) seems to have existed as a village at a very
early period. Its <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> name was Kusuma-pura. It was enlarged and
practically founded about the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of the Buddha’s <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> by
Ajata-?atru[219], who did not, however, remove there from his own
capital <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">city</span> Raja-g?iha. One of his successors, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span> A?oka,
the well-known patron of Buddhism (p. 66), converted Pa?ali-putra into
the metropolis of the kingdom of Magadha, and it thenceforward became an
important centre of Buddhism. Sir A. Cunningham states that it continued
flourishing as the capital of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Gupta kingdom during the fourth
and fifth centuries of the Christian era.

Fa-hien relates a tradition that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span> A?oka’s palace in the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">city</span> was
built by genii (spirits), who <span class="t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> rocks and constructed
chambers by heaping them together. He describes a monastery belonging to
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Great</span> Vehicle, and a temple belonging to the Little Vehicle, in the
neighbourhood of the city, and gives an <span class="t1 t11 t12 t13 t16 t18 t21 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of a Buddhist procession
of four-wheeled cars and images which <span class="t2 t4 t6 t9 t18 t19 t22 hoverable">took</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> once a year. Each car
was twenty-two feet or more high, and had five stories, with niches on
four sides, in which were placed images of the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> and the
Bodhi-sattvas, along with images of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> (devas). They were made to
look like moving pagodas (or Dagabas). The Hindus, as we know, have
similar car-processions to this day, when the images of K?ish?a are
dragged through the streets of towns and villages.

Fa-hien mentions the interesting <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> that the nobles of the country had
founded hospitals in the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">city</span> to which destitute, crippled, and diseased
persons might repair, and receive advice, food, and medicines suited to
their cases, gratuitously. He adds that A?oka, wishing to build 84,000
Stupas[220] in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> of the eight originally constructed over the
Buddha’s ashes, built the first Stupa and a pillar near Pa?ali-putra.

Near it he says was an impression of the Buddha’s foot, over which a
temple with a door towards the north had been erected (Legge, pp. 77-80;
Beal, i. lv-lviii). The position of the Stupa and column has been
discovered by Sir A. Cunningham (xi. 157, 158).


                              _Kesariya._

Kesariya is a large village about thirty miles distant from Vai?ali
(Besarh). It is chiefly remarkable for a mound of ruined brick-work, 62
feet in height, supporting a solid brick Stupa (nearly 68½ feet in
diameter), which is also partly in ruins. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> <span class="t8 t13 t21 hoverable">call</span> it the Stupa
of the Cakravarti (Universal Monarch) Ve?a, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">father</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span> P?ithu. In
Manu, VII. 41; IX. 66, 67, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span> Ve?a is described as an arrogant monarch
who resisted the authority of the Brahmans. Probably he favoured the
Buddhists. At any rate the Buddhists assert that the remarkable Stupa at
this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> was built to mark the spot where Gautama <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> preached a
discourse, in which he described one of his previous births as a
Cakravarti king.

Not far from the Stupa a small mound has been excavated, and the <span class="t1 t4 t9 t16 hoverable">head</span>
and shoulders of a colossal statue of <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> <span class="t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span>
(Cunningham, i. 67).


                             _Ku?i-nagara._

Ku?i-nagara (in Pali Kusi-nara) was the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> where the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> died,
or—to <span class="t6 t9 t11 t19 t20 t22 hoverable">speak</span> more correctly—passed away in Pari-nirva?a (see pp. 48, 49,
140). It was <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> searched for in vain, but has recently been identified
by Sir A. Cunningham with the modern Kasia, eighty miles east of
Kapila-vastu, and 120 miles N.N.E. of Benares.

Neither Fa-hien nor Hiouen Thsang say much about Ku?i-nagara, except
that it was deserted and had few inhabitants; but the latter’s allusion
to the Buddha’s passing away out of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> at this place, and his
<span class="t1 t11 t12 t13 t16 t18 t21 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the subsequent assembling of the first council at Raja-g?iha
by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">order</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Ka?yapa (pp. 47, 55), is so interesting and
curious that I here give an abstract of his narrative, based on Mr.
Beal’s translation (ii. 161):—

  Once when the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Ka?yapa was seated in meditation, suddenly a

Then, exerting his
  faculty of supernatural vision, he saw the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> passing away

  followers to accompany him to the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">city</span> of Ku?i-nagara.

  there they met a Brahman, who, on being asked whence he came, replied,
  ‘From Ku?i-nagara, where I saw your <span class="t0 t1 t8 t11 t15 t21 t23 t24 hoverable">master</span> entering into Nirva?a. A
  vast multitude of heavenly <span class="t0 t1 t15 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> were around him.’

  Ka?yapa having <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t18 hoverable">heard</span> these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> said, ‘The <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t21 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">sun</span> of <span class="t7 t8 t12 hoverable">wisdom</span> has

  But certain careless monks said one to another, with satisfaction,
  ‘Tathagata has gone to rest. This is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> for us; for now, if we
  transgress, who is there to reprove us?’ Then Ka?yapa was deeply
  moved, and resolved to secure obedience to the teaching of Buddha.

  Addressing the assembled multitude, he said, ‘We ought to collect the
  Law. Those who have kept it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> failure, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> powers of
  discrimination are clear, such persons may <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> the assembly. Those
  who are only learners must depart to their homes.’

  On this they <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> away, and only 999 <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> were left, including Ananda.
  But the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Ka?yapa excluded Ananda as being <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> a learner.
  Addressing him, he said, ‘You are not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> <span class="t1 t8 hoverable">free</span> from defect; you, too,
  must leave the assembly. You were a personal attendant on Buddha, you
  loved him much, and are, therefore, not <span class="t1 t8 hoverable">free</span> from the ties of
  affection.’

  So Ananda retired to a desert place. Wearied out, he desired to lie
  down. Scarcely had his <span class="t1 t4 t9 t16 hoverable">head</span> reached the pillow, when lo! he obtained
  the condition of an Arhat. Then he returned to the door of the
  assembly. But Ka?yapa said to him, ‘Have you got rid of all ties? If
  so, prove it; exercise your <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> and enter <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> the door
  being opened.’ Then Ananda entered through the key-hole, and having
  paid reverence to the assembled monks, sat down.

This <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of reducing the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> to the size of an atom, so as to be able
to <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t11 t12 t19 t22 hoverable">pass</span> through so minute an aperture as a key-hole, was one of the
supernatural faculties supposed to belong to perfected saints or Arhats
(compare pp. 133, 245 of these Lectures).

The consideration of Buddhist Sacred Places might lead us on to various
hallowed spots in other Buddhist countries, for example, Anuradha-pura,
Adam’s Peak and Kelani in Ceylon; the site of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> pagoda at
Rangoon, and of that near Mandalay in Burma; the site of the Buddha’s
foot-print (Phra Bat) in Siam; the snows of Kinchinjunga in Sikkim; the

these, and other places, have either been incidentally mentioned in
previous Lectures or will be more fully noticed hereafter.




                              LECTURE XV.
                       _Monasteries and Temples._


Buddhist monasteries deserve a fuller notice than the incidental
allusions we have made to them in previous Lectures.

The duty of dwelling under trees, and not in houses, according to the
example <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> by all the Buddhas (see p. 136), and especially by Gautama
<span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> himself, during his <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> course of meditation (see p. 31), was in
theory supposed to be binding on all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> monks. ‘The root of a tree for
an abode’ was one of ‘the four Resources,’ of which every monk was
allowed to avail himself, and the enumeration of which formed part of
the admission-ceremonies (see p. 80).

At the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> certain dispensations or indulgences were specially
granted at those ceremonies, one of which was permission to live in
covered residences, when not itinerating. The five kinds of dwellings
permissible under varying circumstances are described in Culla-vagga
(VI. 1, 2). They are Viharas (monasteries), A??hayogas (i. e. houses of
a peculiar shape), storied dwellings (prasada)[221], mansions (harmya),
and caves (see note, p. 81 of this volume).

It is clear that any painful exposure of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> to the violent storms
of India was incompatible with one of the principles of Buddhism, which,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> it taught self-denial and self-sacrifice of a particular kind,
deprecated all personal self-inflicted pain and austerity.

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> it appears (from Maha-vagga, III. 15) that at the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of his first
residence at Raja-g?iha (see p. 29 of these Lectures), the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> had
not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> instituted ‘the Retreat’ during the rains (Vassa). Hence the
monks were in the habit of going on their travels alike during winter,
summer, and the rainy season.

The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> complained of this, and said that the monks in walking about
during wet weather were unable to avoid crushing vegetable <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> and
treading on minute living things. Thereupon the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> prescribed that
the monks were to keep ‘Vassa,’ and refrain from peregrination during
the rains.

Soon afterwards, when the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> had <span class="t1 t7 t12 t29 hoverable">left</span> Raja-g?iha and had <span class="t2 t5 t11 t18 t19 t23 t26 hoverable">taken</span> up
his abode during Vassa in the Jeta-vana garden at Savatthi (see p. 407),
a wealthy and pious layman (Upasaka) who had built a monastery (Vihara)
for the monks, sent to invite them to reside in it, saying that he
wished to hear them recite the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Law</span> and to bestow gifts <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> them. The
<span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> permitted them to go, but required them to return in seven days.
He gave the same permission when another rich and pious layman had
provided other residences and conveniences for the monks, such as a
storied house, a mansion, a store-room, a cave, a refectory, a bathing
room, a well-house, a pavilion, a park, etc.

On the other hand, when, on a particular occasion, a monk wished to keep
Vassa in a cattle-pen (Maha-vagga, III. 12) the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> permitted him to
do so. So, again, on another occasion he allowed a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> to keep Vassa in
a caravan, and on a <span class="t26 hoverable">third</span> occasion in a covered boat or ship. But it is
recorded that he prohibited Vassa from being kept in the open air, or in
the hollow of trees[222] (see Maha-vagga, III. 12, 3).

It is evident from all this, that even in the early <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">days</span> of Buddhism,
rich laymen were in the habit of seeking to acquire religious merit by
providing comfortable habitations for the monks; and although at first
the <span class="t1 hoverable">use</span> of such luxuries was only permitted in the rainy season, this
restriction was soon removed, and a residence in covered dwellings
became usual at all seasons of the year.

Then, as Buddhism spread, kings, princes, and rich <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> competed with
each other for the privilege of erecting vast monasteries—sometimes
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Viharas[223], sometimes Sa?gharamas—to which temples, libraries,
and schools were generally attached, and in which dwelt wealthy
communities of monks, who were allowed to hold property in land.

The founding of extensive and important institutions of this <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> was,
of course, an exceptional proceeding. As a general rule, collections of
monastic dwellings were of a simple and unostentatious character. In
various parts of India are to be seen in the present <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span>
Buddhist cave-monasteries now untenanted, some of them—such as the caves
of Barabar—as old as the <span class="t26 hoverable">third</span> century B.C.

I myself visited those at Elora (Elura), twelve miles from Aurangabad in
the Nizam’s territory, as <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as others at Nasik, Karle, and other
places. The Elora caves are possibly as old as the <span class="t26 hoverable">third</span> century[224],
and with the adjoining Brahmanical and Jain caves of later date, extend
for one mile and a quarter along the scarp of an elevated plateau. The
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> groups of caves rival each other in the beauty and interest of
their sculptures, and <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> constitute one of the wonders of
India—their position side by side proving that the adherents of the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> systems lived <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> in harmony. Among the Buddhist caves are
beautiful ‘Caityas’ or halls for general <span class="t0 t5 t11 hoverable">worship</span> (see p. 450),
refectories for commensality, and cells <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> <span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span> for the
habitation of the monks. All the excavations had become partially filled
up; but the visit of the Prince of Wales in 1876 stimulated the Nizam’s
government to clear away the dust and rubbish of centuries.

Then, besides cave-monasteries, the ruins of extensive monastic
establishments built of brick, stone, or other less durable materials,
are scattered everywhere throughout India.

Those of the vast monastery of Nalanda near Raja-g?iha, and others at
various other sacred places, have been already described (see p. 412).

Turning next to the monastic structures of modern Buddhist countries,
and beginning with Ceylon, we <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> that in that island, as Spence Hardy
has pointed out, and as I myself observed during my sojourn there, the
residences of the monks are of very simple construction, and often
extremely mean in appearance. They are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Pan-salas (Pa??a-?ala =
Sansk?it Par?a-?ala) because supposed to be made of leaves. In general,
however, they are constructed of wattle filled up with mud, the roof
being covered with straw, or with the platted leaves of the cocoa-nut.
They are always dirty and always abound in cobwebs.

A monastery which I saw near Kandy consisted of an oblong rectangular
court-yard, surrounded in the interior by a <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of roofed cloister or
verandah, out of which opened the monks’ cells, lighted only from the
sky above the court. The interior walls of both cloister and cells were
begrimed with patches of dirt and masses of cobwebs, which are never
touched for <span class="t9 t19 hoverable">fear</span> of breaking the first Buddhist commandment, ‘kill not’
(p. 126).

Of course there are monasteries of a better and more imposing type, such
as that attached to the Maligawa temple of the sacred eye-tooth on the
Kandy lake (see p. 454).

In Burma the ordinary residences of the monks appear to be simple in
character, like those in Ceylon. In Siam, on the contrary, they are
sometimes elaborate, and often have richly-covered entrances. At the
same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> the Siamese monks (according to Mr. Alabaster) are in the
habit of itinerating a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> deal, only remaining in their monasteries
during the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> months of rains, when residence there is imperative.

Speaking of the larger and more imposing monasteries (Kyoung) in Burma,
Mr. Scott says (I give his <span class="t1 t11 t12 t13 t16 t18 t21 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> in an abbreviated form):—

  The monasteries are built of teak, or, sometimes in Mandalay and Lower
  Burma, of brick. The shape is always oblong, and the inhabited portion
  is raised on posts and pillars, eight or ten feet above the ground.
  They are, like all the other houses in the country, only one story
  high; for if it is an indignity to a layman to have anyone’s feet over
  his head[225], it is much more so to a member of the brotherhood. The
  space between the ground and the floor is always kept open, and is
  never <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">used</span> except by the monastery school-boys. A flight of steps of
  stone or wood leads up to the verandah, which extends along the north
  and south sides, and frequently all round. From the raised floor <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span>
  reached, rises the building, with tier <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> tier of massive roofs (in
  diminishing stages), giving the appearance of many stories when there
  is only one. The accommodation is simple. It consists in the main of a
  central hall divided into <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> portions, one level with the verandah
  where the scholars are taught, and most of the duties of the monastery
  carried on, and the other a dais, raised about <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> feet above the
  level of the rest of the building. Seated <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> this, the monks are
  accustomed to receive visitors, and at the back, against the wall, are
  arranged the images of Buddha, a large one usually standing in the
  centre on a <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of altar, with candles, flowers, praying flags, and
  other offerings placed before it. On shelves alongside are a <span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span> of
  smaller figures of gold, silver, alabaster, clay or wood, according to
  the popularity of the monastery, and the religious character of the
  neighbourhood. Occasionally there are dormitories for the monks, but
  as a rule they sleep in the central hall, where the mats which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span>
  their beds may be seen rolled up against the wall. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> area of
  the extensive compound in which the monastery stands is enclosed by a
  heavy teak fence with massive posts and rails, seven or eight feet
  high. The laity, when they enter, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> off their shoes and carry them
  in their hands. This rule applies to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t22 t23 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">highest</span> in the land.

The daily <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of the monks inhabiting monasteries of this <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> in Burma
has been already described (see pp. 311-314 of these Lectures).

If we now <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t11 t12 t19 t22 hoverable">pass</span> to northern Buddhist countries we shall <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> that, as a
general rule, the dwellings of monks are insignificant tenements of poor
construction, attached to or built round small chapels or shrines.
Sometimes the monks live in the rooms built over such chapels.

Sir Richard Temple (Journal, ii. 207) visited a so-called monastery at
Pemyangchi (in Sikkim), which consisted of a single building with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span>
stories. In the upper some of the monks resided, and a chapel formed the
lower.

The temple-monastery I myself visited in British Sikkim, near Darjiling,
is similar. The exterior appearance might be compared to that of some
small Dissenting chapel in an English village. The thatched roof, which
once gave it a picturesque appearance, has recently been removed, and a
roof of modern construction substituted. The shrine or temple is on the
ground floor, while the upper floor is the abode of the attendant
priests, and seems also to serve as a store-room with cupboards for
their equipments. The contents of the ground-floor temple, with its
altar at the further end and shelves for the sacred books on one side,
are very indistinctly seen, being only lighted up by a ‘dim religious
light,’ when the door is kept wide open. I noticed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> images on the
altar.

The <span class="t5 t16 t21 t24 t25 hoverable">case</span> is different when large numbers of monks congregate in
particular places. In some districts of Ladak, Mongolia and Tibet,
monasteries (or Lamaseries as they are sometimes called) have been
erected, which for vastness, magnificence, and grandeur of situation
amid splendid scenery, are unequalled in any part of the world.

According to strict rule, retired localities should be chosen. Hence
large monastic establishments are often found in solitary places[226]
and elevated situations; for instance, in Ladak those at Lama Yurru and
Hemis are more than 11,000 feet above the sea, and that at Hanle is
14,000 feet. They resemble romantic castles towering upwards in the
midst of rocks, crags, and snowy mountains.

Another monastery at Kilang (Kyelang), in the British Tibetan province
of Lahul (contiguous to Ladak), stands on the spur of a mountain, at an
elevation of 12,000 feet, and is approached through grand ravines and
glaciers, so that occasionally, after snow-storms, those who <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t11 t12 t19 t22 hoverable">pass</span> to and
fro are buried in avalanches.

The outer walls of large monasteries of this <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> in secluded situations
are generally lofty. Often they are made of stone or brick, plastered
with mud and surmounted with little pinnacles and poles, on which are
prayer-flags. <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">Within</span> the walls are cells for the monks, the abode of the
<span class="t1 t4 t9 t16 hoverable">Head</span> or Abbot, a room for holding books, a temple, an assembly-hall, a
refectory, store-houses, receptacles for musical instruments, masks,
staves, etc.; the buildings being often arranged in rows, and always
intermixed with Stupas (see p. 504) and monuments. The walls of the
vestibules and of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> hall are usually ornamented with
fresco-paintings, representing subjects from the Buddhist Jatakas (p.
111). Generally there are corridors or covered cloisters lined with
prayer-wheels, or open walks paved with stone, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> in Sansk?it
Cankrama?a (Pali, Cankamana), for the monks to perambulate up and down
in meditation. These are supposed to be constructed after the pattern of
the stone walking-places <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">used</span> by the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> himself (see p. 400).

In the monastery at Kilang the roof of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> hall is supported by
massive beams garnished with belts, swords, yaks’ tails, huge and
terrible masks, and all sorts of odds and ends. On one side is a huge
praying-wheel, on each revolution of which a bell is struck. A dim
subdued <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> pervades the entire hall, exaggerating the ghastly
hideousness of the figures[227].

To <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> as another instance—the monastery or Lamasery of Kunbum (or
Kumbum) north of Tibet, celebrated as the birth-place of Tsong Khapa (p.
277), and situated, according to M. Huc, on a mountain intersected by a
broad and deep ravine:—

  On either side of the ravine, and up the slopes of the mountain, rise,
  in amphitheatrical curves, the white dwellings of the Lamas, each with
  its little terrace and enclosing wall, while here and there above them
  ‘tower the temples, with their gilt roofs glittering with a <span class="t6 hoverable">thousand</span>
  colours.’ The houses of the superior monks are distinguished by
  pennants, floating above small hexagonal turrets, while those of the
  ordinary monks are simple cells. On all sides mystical sentences, in
  the Tibetan character, meet the eye (see p. 381), some inscribed on
  doors, some on walls and stones, or on linen flags fixed on poles.

  Almost everywhere are conical vessels, in which incense and
  odoriferous wood are burning; while numbers of Lamas circulate through
  the streets of the monastery in their red and yellow dresses—grave in
  their deportment, and, although under no obligation to silence,
  speaking little, and that little in a low voice.

This Lamasery of Kunbum enjoys so <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> a reputation, that the
worshippers of <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> make pilgrimages to it from all parts of Mongolia,
Tartary, and Tibet, and on the occasion of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> festivals the
confluence of strangers is immense. It is much frequented by Eastern
Tibetans.

Near Kunbum is a much smaller monastery, devoted to the study of
medicine. It is at the foot of a rocky mountain, on the heights of which
dwell certain contemplative monks. M. Huc saw one of these hermits, who
never communicated with the outer <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> except for food, which he drew
up to his rocky cell by the help of a bag tied to a <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> rope (ii. 73).

Some mention should also be made of the monasteries at Kuku khotun, ‘the
blue city’ in Tartary. That town contains no less than five <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>
Lamaseries and fifteen affiliated monasteries, with a grand total of
20,000 Lamas dwelling in them. The chief monastery is that of the ‘Five
Towers’—not to be confounded with one of the same name in the Chinese
province of Shan si.

This latter is a celebrated <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> for burials (see p. 370), and pilgrims
may there be edified by a sight of the Buddha’s shadow impressed on a
rock.

Another example of a monastery in a remote situation is that of Kurun or
Kuren (see p. 295), situated on the slope of a mountain in Mongolia. In
this celebrated monastery of the Grand Lama Taranatha 30,000 Lamas
(according to M. Huc) are lodged and supported.

  The plain at the foot of the mountain is constantly covered with tents
  of various sizes for the convenience of pilgrims. Hither throng the
  worshippers of <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> from the most remote countries.

  Viewed from a distance, the white cells of the Lamas, built on the
  declivity in horizontal lines one above the other, resemble the steps
  of an enormous altar, of which the temple of the Taranatha Lama
  appears to constitute (in Roman Catholic phraseology) ‘the
  tabernacle.’ In this country Taranatha is the saint par excellence,
  and there is not a Tartar Khalka who does not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> a pride in calling
  himself his disciple.

Passing on now to Tibet, we <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> that in its principal provinces the
<span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span> of monastic institutions connected with its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> respective
capitals of Lhassa and Tashi Lunpo, is more than a thousand, with
491,242 Lamas. This is the estimate of the latest traveller[228].

According to Huc, more than thirty large monasteries may be reckoned in
the neighbourhood of Lhassa alone.

Adverting for a moment to Lhassa itself, we may <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">note</span> that this ‘city of
the gods’—the chief town of the province of U, situated on the Ki-chu
river[229]—had in 1854 about 15,000 inhabitants <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">within</span> a circumference
of two-and-a-half miles. According to a Chinese proverb, its chief
inmates have always been ‘priests, women, and dogs.’ Koeppen affirms
that Lhassa has always been a greater nest of monk-priests than Rome has
ever been.

Doubtless its population is now increased, and includes a considerable
proportion of laymen; yet, in all likelihood, at least two-thirds of the
inhabitants are monks; and it cannot be too often repeated that,
according to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> theory of Buddhism, the only raison d’être of the
laity is to wait <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the monkhood.

Moreover, Lhassa, next to Benares and Mecca, is, perhaps, the most
frequented <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> of pilgrimage <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> earth. Scarcely a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> passes on
which the streets do not overflow with crowds of pilgrims—some from
every quarter of Tibet, some from Bhutan and other Himalayan regions,
some from all parts of Mongolia. All meet here to <span class="t0 t5 t11 hoverable">worship</span> the incarnated
representative of the Bodhi-sattva (Avalokite?vara) manifested in the
Dalai Lama—to receive his blessing, his consecrated pills, and his
prayer-papers (see p. 331 of these Lectures). The residence of this
Lamistic Pope is at Potala.

In <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> Potala on the north-west side of Lhassa is what the Vatican is
to Rome. It existed in <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> times as a palace, but was rebuilt and
converted into a palace-monastery by the celebrated fifth Dalai Lama
Navang Lobsang, A.D. 1617-1682 (p. 292 of this volume), and from that
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> forward became the residence of all the Dalai Lamas, who had before
lived either at Sera or at Brepung (Dapung, see p. 442).

In its striking and unique position, it is even more imposing than the
Vatican.

Imagine a lofty structure erected on an isolated hill[230], rising
abruptly from the plain with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> summits or eminences, and
watered at the base by the Ki-chu river, which flows into the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>
Tsanpo. The south-western ridge is the so-called Iron-hill, on which is
a monastery where Tsong Khapa himself is said to have taught. The
north-eastern bears the name of the Phagmo hill[231], while the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t22 t23 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">highest</span>
is the hill of Potala, with its palace-monastery towering in four
stories to the height of about 367 feet, and ending in a cupola covered
with plates of pure gold.

From this vantage ground the incarnated Bodhi-sattva looks down on the
crowds of pilgrims approaching to <span class="t0 t5 t11 hoverable">worship</span> him, or kneeling at the foot
of the hill. The buildings grouped in the vicinity are said to contain
10,000 rooms, for the accommodation of as many monks. Countless are the
statues of Buddha, with other idols and images of saints, not to mention
obelisks and pyramidal monuments, which meet the eye everywhere. All
sacred objects are manufactured out of gold, silver, or copper,
according to the wealth of those who have <span class="t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> them as offerings. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Two</span>
ascending avenues lead up from Lhassa to Potala, which are constantly
thronged with foreign pilgrims, troops of Lamas in official vestments,
<span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> Lamas and courtiers in <span class="t10 t16 hoverable">full</span> uniform. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> we are told that a
solemn religious silence prevails, for the thoughts of all are fixed in
meditation.

I have already given an abstract of Mr. Sarat Chandra Das’ narrative of
his visit to Potala, and his presentation to the Dalai Lama on June 10,
1882 (see p. 331 of these Lectures). I now add an <span class="t1 t11 t12 t13 t16 t18 t21 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of Mr. Thomas
Manning’s interview with the Dalai Lama on December 17, 1811. No
European, except Mr. Manning[232], has ever <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> <span class="t2 t6 t19 t20 t26 t29 hoverable">eyes</span> on a Dalai Lama,
and no other Englishman has ever seen Lhassa (for M. Huc was
misinformed; Moorcroft was never there):—

  We rode to the foot of the mountain on which the palace is built, or
  out of which, rather, it seems to grow; but having ascended a few
  paces to a platform, were obliged to dismount. From here to the hall
  where the Grand Lama receives visitors is a <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> and tedious ascent.
  It consists of about four hundred steps, partly stone steps in the
  rocky mountain, and the rest mere ladders from story to story in the
  palace. Besides this, from interval to interval along the mountain,
  wherever the ascent is easy, there are stretches interspersed, where
  the path continues for several paces <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> steps. At length
  we arrived at the large platform on which is built the hall of
  reception. There we rested awhile, arranged the presents, and
  conferred with the Lama’s Chinese interpreter.

  The Tí-mu-fu was in the hall with the Grand Lama. I was not informed
  of this until I entered, which occasioned me some confusion. I did not
  know how much ceremony to go through with one, before I began with the
  other. I made the due obeisance, touching the ground <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> times with
  my <span class="t1 t4 t9 t16 hoverable">head</span> to the Grand Lama, and once to the Tí-mu-fu. I presented my
  gifts, delivering the coin and the handsome silk scarf with my own
  <span class="t20 hoverable">hands</span> into the <span class="t20 hoverable">hands</span> of the Grand Lama. I then <span class="t2 t4 t6 t9 t18 t19 t22 hoverable">took</span> off my hat, and
  humbly gave him my clean-shaven <span class="t1 t4 t9 t16 hoverable">head</span> to lay his <span class="t20 hoverable">hands</span> upon. The
  ceremony of presentation being over, the Munshi and I sat down on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span>
  cushions not far from the Lama’s throne, and had tea <span class="t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> to us. It
  was most excellent, and I meant to have emptied the cup, but it was
  whipped away suddenly, before I was aware of it. The Lama’s beautiful
  and interesting <span class="t3 hoverable">face</span> and manner engrossed almost all my attention. He
  was at that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> about seven <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> old; and had the simple and
  unaffected manners of a well-educated princely child. His <span class="t3 hoverable">face</span> was, I
  thought, poetically and affectingly beautiful. He was of a gay and
  cheerful disposition; his beautiful mouth perpetually unbending into a
  graceful smile, which illuminated his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> countenance. Sometimes,
  particularly when he had looked at me, his smile approached to a
  gentle laugh. No doubt my grim beard and spectacles somewhat excited
  his risibility. He inquired <span class="t0 t5 t8 t10 t14 t15 t21 t24 t28 hoverable">whether</span> I had not met with molestation and
  difficulties on the road; to which I promptly returned the proper
  answer. A present of dried fruit was <span class="t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> and <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> before me, and
  then we withdrew. (Mr. Clements Markham’s Tibet, p. 264, abridged.)

As to the monasteries grouped around this Vatican of Lamistic Buddhism,
we may make special mention of four, noting a few particulars.

To begin with the oldest monastery, that of _La brang_, said to mean
‘abode of Lamas[233],’ which was built by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span> Srong Tsan Gampo (see p.
271 of this volume), and founded in the seventh century. This <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span>
institution is in the very centre of Lhassa, and is regarded as the
centre of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> country. All the main roads of Tibet converge
towards it. Doubtless the area of the monastery has been enlarged by
occasional additions in the course of one <span class="t6 hoverable">thousand</span> years, but not since
it was partly rebuilt and restored in the seventeenth century. Its
magnificent temple (Cho Khang) is the St. Peter’s of Lamism (see p.
459).

The immense <span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span> of monks inhabiting this monastery is proved by the
<span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> that a huge cauldron is shown which holds more than 1200 gallons of
tea for the Lamas who perform the daily services.

The other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> monasteries near Potala and La brang, according to
Koeppen, are devoted to the study of magic and the <span class="t1 t3 t4 t7 t8 t14 t15 t16 t17 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">art</span> of exorcising. We
may <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> them in the following order:—

First, at a short distance north of La brang, stands the monastery
_Ramoche_, ‘the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> enclosure,’ which was the other <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> monastery
built by Srong Tsan Gampo, or by one of his wives (see p. 271). It is
now a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> school of exorcism, and has a celebrated temple (see pp.
462, 463), containing the celebrated image of the Buddha, and also one
of Nanda, Gautama’s step-brother and disciple. Those who study here may
gain the decree of ‘Doctor of Magic.’

Next comes the monastery of _Moru_ (or Muru or Meru), close to the city.
It is noted for its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">order</span> and cleanliness, and for its printing-press.
Like the last, it contains a school for instruction in magic.

Then, at a short distance east of La brang (according to Koeppen), is
the monastery of _Gar Ma Khian_—the mother monastery of soothsayers,
fortune-tellers, and exorcisers (Chos-kyong, see p. 266).

Let us next turn to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> ‘mother-monasteries’ of the Yellow
sect—Galdan, Sera, and Dapung.

_Galdan_ (_or Gahdan_), the ‘heaven of contented beings’ (Sansk?it
Tushita, see pp. 207, 213)—the oldest monastery of the Yellow sect—is
situated on the hill of the same name, about thirty miles[234] east of
Lhassa. As already stated (pp. 278, 294), it was founded by Tsong Khapa
A.D. 1409. It is three-quarters of a mile in circumference, and has 3300
monks.

_Sera_, ‘the golden,’ founded by Tsong Khapa (p. 278), or by one of his
disciples immediately after his death, lies about <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> miles north of
Lhassa, on a declivity of a hill, over which passes the road leading to
Mongolia. It has 5500 monks, and numerous temples, towers, and houses
curving round like an amphitheatre. On the hills above the town are rows
of cells of contemplative monks and recluses.

Sera has <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> temples several stories high, the halls of which
are richly gilded. In one temple the staff of Gautama <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> is
preserved.

_Dapung_ (variously Dapu?, Depung, Debung, Debang, Brepung, Brebung,
Prebung), ‘rice-heap,’ so <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> from the shape of the hill, was also
founded by Tsong Khapa <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> before Sera, and is situated four
miles west of the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">city</span> of Lhassa. It has 7700 monks. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> temple in
the middle is surrounded by four small ones. One of these four belongs
to the exorcisers and professors of magical arts, of whom there are
nearly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> hundred. In the centre of the monastery is a residence for
the Dalai Lama, when he pays his annual visit. Numbers of foreigners
study here, especially Mongolians. In front of the monastery stands a
Stupa, which contains the bones of the fourth Dalai Lama, Jon Tan Yam
Thso, who was of a Mongolian family.

Mr. Edgar (Report, p. 41) mentions four other monasteries of the Yellow
sect around Lhassa, _Chemiling_, _Tengiling_, _Chechuling_, and
_Kenduling_[235]. The last is said to be the residence of the Regent (p.
286 of these Lectures). Sarat Chandra Das gives a <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> list of
monasteries, some containing 5000 monks (e.g. Rnam rgyal grvatsang,
Gongdkar rDorjegdan, etc.) and some 7000.

We have next to describe the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> monastery of the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t13 t14 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">second</span> Grand Lama of
Tibetan Buddhism—I mean that at _Tashi Lunpo_, also belonging to the
Yellow sect.

_Tashi Lunpo_, near _Shigatse_, is the seat of government of the Tashi
Lama or Panchen Lama (see p. 284 of these Lectures), and the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t13 t14 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">second</span>
metropolis of Lamistic Buddhism. Our <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of this celebrated <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span>
is derived from the record of the journeys of Mr. Bogle and Captain
Turner, as <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as from the narratives of Indian explorers.

According to some of these authorities, Tashi Lunpo is situated about
140 English miles in a nearly westerly direction from Lhassa. It is
built on a level plain enclosed on all sides by rocky hills, through
which a small river (the Painam) rushes into the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Tsanpo
(Brahma-putra). The monastery is said to have been built by the first
Dalai Lama, Gedun grub pa, in 1445 (see p. 291 of these Lectures),
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> the final seat of the Dalai Lamas was at Lhassa.

According to Koeppen four roads meet at Tashi Lunpo; one leading to
Lhassa, one to Ladak, one to Nepal, and one to Bhutan.

Near at hand, on the north-east side of the Tashi Lunpo monastery, on a
rocky eminence protecting it from the cold winds, stands the fort of
Shigatse (also <span class="t2 t11 t15 t19 t25 t27 hoverable">written</span> Shigatze), which, with its surrounding houses,
forms the capital of the province of Tsang, just as Lhassa constitutes
that of the province of U.

Our fellow countryman, Mr. Bogle, commissioned by Warren Hastings to
open communications between Bengal and Tibet, arrived at Tashi Lunpo in
1774. His description of it is to the following effect. I give it
abbreviated (from Mr. Clements Markham’s Tibet):—

  We passed by the foot of Tashi Lunpo, which is built on the lower
  declivity of a steep hill. The roof of the palace is all of
  copper-gilt. The building is of dark-coloured brick. The houses of the
  town rise one above another. Four churches with gilt ornaments are
  mixed with them. Altogether the town presents a princely appearance.
  Many of the courts are spacious, flagged with stone, and have
  galleries running round them. The alleys, which are likewise paved,
  are narrow. The palace is appropriated to the Lama and his officers,
  to temples, granaries, warehouses, etc. The rest of the town is
  entirely inhabited by priests, who are in <span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span> about four thousand.

The following is the substance of Mr. Bogle’s <span class="t1 t11 t12 t13 t16 t18 t21 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of his interview
with the Tashi Lama on November 8, 1774 (abbreviated from Markham’s
Tibet):—

  In the afternoon I had my first audience of the Tashi Lama. He is
  about forty <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> of age, of low stature, and inclining to be fat. His
  complexion is fairer than that of most Tibetans, and his arms are as
  white as those of a European; his hair, which is jet black, is cut
  very short; his <span class="t2 t6 t19 t20 t26 t29 hoverable">eyes</span> are small and black. The expression of his
  countenance is smiling and good-humoured. He was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> his throne,
  formed of wood carved and gilt, with some cushions above it, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span>
  which he sat with his legs folded under him. He was dressed in a
  mitre-shaped cap of yellow broadcloth, with <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> bars lined with red
  satin, a yellow cloth jacket <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> sleeves, and a satin mantle of
  the same colour thrown over his shoulders. On one side of him stood
  his physician, with a bundle of perfumed sandal-wood rods burning in
  his hand; on the other stood his cup-bearer. I laid the Governor’s
  presents before him, delivering the letter and the pearl necklace into
  his own hands, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> with a white handkerchief on my own part,
  according to the custom of the country. He received me in the most
  engaging manner. I was seated on a <span class="t17 t29 hoverable">high</span> stool covered with a carpet.
  Plates of boiled mutton, boiled rice, dried fruits, sweetmeats, sugar,
  bundles of tea, dried sheep’s carcases, etc., were <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> before me and
  my companion, Mr. Hamilton. The Lama drank <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> dishes of tea
  with us, but <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> saying any grace, asked us once or twice to eat,
  and on our retiring threw white handkerchiefs over our necks. After
  <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> visits, he <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">used</span> to receive me <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> any ceremony, his
  <span class="t1 t4 t9 t16 hoverable">head</span> uncovered, and dressed only in the large red petticoat worn by
  all <span class="t10 t16 hoverable">full</span> monks, red boots, a yellow cloth vest, with his arms bare,
  and a piece of coarse yellow cloth thrown across his shoulders. He sat
  sometimes in a chair, sometimes on a bench covered with tiger-skins,
  and nobody but the cup-bearer present. Sometimes he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> walk with me
  about the room, explain the pictures, or make some remarks <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the
  colour of my eyes, etc. For, although venerated as God’s vicegerent
  through all the eastern countries of Asia, and endowed with a portion
  of omniscience and with many other <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> attributes, he throws aside
  in conversation all the awful part of his character, accommodates
  himself to the weakness of mortals, endeavours to make himself loved
  rather than feared, and behaves with the greatest affability to
  everybody, particularly to strangers.

In 1783, when Tashi Lunpo was visited by Captain Turner, the monastery
consisted of 400 houses, many of which were built of stone and marble,
and at least <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> stories high. They contained about 3700 monks (now
3800). Around the houses were gilded temples, pinnacles, pyramidal
monuments (Stupas), and above all the palace of the Tashi Lama, forming
a striking spectacle.

Captain Turner had a remarkable interview with the Grand Lama at the
neighbouring monastery of Terpaling, on December 4, 1783. He found the
princely child, then aged eighteen months, seated on a throne, with his
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">father</span> and mother standing on the <span class="t1 t7 t12 t29 hoverable">left</span> hand. Having been informed that,
although unable to speak, he could understand, Captain Turner intimated
to him ‘that the Governor-General, on receiving news of his decease, had
been overwhelmed with sorrow, and continued to lament his absence from
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> until the cloud was dispelled by his re-appearance. The
Governor hoped that he might <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> continue to illumine the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> by his
presence.’

The infant looked steadfastly at the British envoy, and appeared to be
listening to his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> with deep attention, while he repeatedly nodded
his head, as if he understood every syllable. He was silent and sedate,
and conducted himself with astonishing dignity. Captain Turner <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span>
him one of the handsomest <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">children</span> he had ever seen. It seems that he
grew up to be an able and devout ruler, gratifying the Tibetans by his
presence for many years, and living to a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> old age.

Tashi Lunpo was not visited by the French missionaries, but M. Huc
informs us (ii. 157) that in 1846 the then Panchen Lama was 60 <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> of
age, and still vigorous. M. Huc was told that he was of Indian origin,
and that he had declared of himself that his first incarnation had <span class="t2 t5 t11 t18 t19 t23 t26 hoverable">taken</span>

Lunpo on the 9th of December, 1881 (the extract is not given literally,
and is abbreviated):—

  In the afternoon we arrived at Tashi Lunpo. In front of the western
  entrance I noticed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> Chortens (that is, ‘Caityas or Stupas,’ see p.
  504 of these Lectures), one very large, with a gilt spire, and the
  other small. On entering the grand monastery, I mustered all my
  <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of Buddhist ceremonies and monkish etiquette, that I might
  not be criticised by the passing monks as one unacquainted with the
  duties of the wearers of the sacred costume. I walked slowly and with
  gravity, but secretly observing everything around me. There were a few
  yaks under the charge of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> or four herdsmen, waiting probably for
  the return of some of their <span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span> from <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">within</span> the monastery. Some
  monks, riding on mules, passed us from north to south. A few parties
  with heavy grain packages on their backs were entering the monastery
  along with us. The rays of the sun, now slanting on the gilded spires
  of houses and tombs in the monastery, presented a very magnificent
  <span class="t25 hoverable">view</span> to the eye.

  While residing in the monastery I saw <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> busily engaged in
  out-door work, such as collecting fuel and tending cattle. In fact,
  this was the busiest part of the year, when the Tibetans remain on the
  move for the purpose of buying and selling, at a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> when the
  intensely cold winds wither up the vegetation, freeze the streams,
  harden the soil, and dry up the skin. The monks, like the lay-people,
  are remarkable for their habit of early rising. No monk <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">within</span> the

  service in the congregation hall. Whoever fails to attend is punished
  next morning. No register is kept, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> the officer who superintends

  in the morning. The monks <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">used</span> often to remark that, were I a regular

About six miles from Tashi Lunpo, and on the road leading from it in a
south-westerly direction towards the monastery of Sakya (see below), is
the monastery of _Narthang_, whence issued one of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> copies of

We have now to notice the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> most important monasteries of the Red
sect.

First, _Sam ye_ (Sam yas) is on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> river Tsanpo, about forty
miles from Lhassa, in a south-easterly direction. It was the first
monastery founded in the eighth century by Padma-sambhava, after <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span>
Khri Srong De Tsan’s restoration of Buddhism (pp. 271, 272). It is the
metropolitan monastery of the Red-capped monks and Urgyanpa sect. Sam ye
was visited by the Indian explorer Nain Singh in 1874, on his final
journey to Lhassa[236], and by Sarat Chandra Das in 1882. Many of its
images are of gold, and it possesses an extensive library.
Padma-sambhava was a <span class="t0 t1 t8 t11 t15 t21 t23 t24 hoverable">master</span> of Indian Yoga and magic. He is fabled to
have worked many miracles—such as filling empty jars with <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span>
water—at Sam ye. He undertook to expel all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> demons from Tibet, but
was opposed by the Bon priests.

The other chief monastery of the Red sect is that of _Sakya_ (Saskya),
situated about fifty-five miles from Tashi Lunpo, on the road leading in
a south-westerly direction towards Nepal. It has four <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> sanctuaries
and a celebrated library, and is surrounded by a large town, with
temples and houses mostly painted red (p. 273).

It should be noted that in all the large monasteries of Northern
Buddhist countries, varied assortments of vestments, robes, costumes,
and masks are kept for <span class="t1 hoverable">use</span> in the religious dances, masquerades, and
dramatic performances which are a characteristic of Northern Buddhism.
Indeed, some of the richer monasteries possess extensive wardrobes of
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> value, and the monks in their masquerading dances change their
costumes very frequently and with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> rapidity (see pp. 347-350).

Note, too, that the libraries of such monasteries generally contain
large and valuable collections of books. The 108 volumes of the northern
canon <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Kanjur, with the commentaries <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Tanjur (see p. 272),
constitute a library in themselves. In addition to these, there are vast
numbers of other treatises <span class="t2 t11 t15 t19 t25 t27 hoverable">written</span> to elucidate the mysteries of
Northern Buddhism, most of which are still a terra incognita to European
scholars. It is <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> known that in mediæval times some Buddhist
monasteries became seats of learning, which might have vied with the
most learned Universities established at that period in Europe.


                               _Temples._

Although temples have been already adverted to as forming an important
feature in all monasteries, and often an actual part of the edifice
constituting the monastery; it will be worth while to devote a short
space of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> to their separate consideration.

In the earliest <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">days</span> of Buddhism neither temples nor halls nor rooms for
meeting <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> (sa?gha-g?iha) were much needed. The monk recited the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Law</span> in the open air or in the houses of the laity. It was only when
collections of monks crystallized into regularly organized communities,
and a <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of congregational recitation of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Law</span> became a part of
every day’s duty, that the monks required places of assembly like
churches for the performance of religious services.

Such places of meeting were often, like the cells for the monks,
excavated out of rocks. And, since relic-shrines <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Caityas (as <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span>
as Stupas, see p. 504) were erected at the further extremity of the
excavated hall, the hall itself was generally <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> a Caitya.

The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> principal rock-excavated Caitya-halls visited by me were at
Elora (also spelt Ellora and Elura) and at Karle (Karli). I was also
much interested in a smaller one at the Nasik caves. In their interior
structure they are all strikingly like <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> Christian churches.

The _Elora_ Caitya forms one of the series of caves already mentioned
(p. 169). It is probably as old as the sixth century of our era, and is
of an elongated horse-shoe shape, with a massive ribbed roof arched like
that of a cathedral, supported on twenty-eight octagonal columns, over
which runs a curious frieze, having on it a carved representation of a
buffalo-hunt and boar-chase. There is a nave with side-aisles about 86
feet <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> by 43 broad. Moreover, over the entrance, supported by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span>
square columns, is a gallery which may have served for a choir or for a
band of musicians. A lofty solid Dagaba, in shape like a massive dome
resting on a cylindrical base, stands at the further end of the nave,
the aisles being continued round it, so that worshippers may
circumambulate the apse. The front of this immense relic-receptacle is
hollowed out to receive a colossal sedent figure of the Buddha, about 17
feet high[237], with the Bodhi-tree carved in an arch above his head.
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Two</span> images of attendants are in an erect attitude, one on each side, but
are not so prominent as to draw off the eye from the immense central
figure.

The Brahmans have now appropriated this cave, and dedicated it to
Vi?va-karma, the supposed patron deity of builders and carpenters. I was
told that carpenters come from all parts of the country to <span class="t0 t5 t11 hoverable">worship</span> the
image in its Brahmanical character. As a token of honour, they smear it
with red paint.

I noticed a remarkable sculpture carved out of the rock near this
cave-temple. It represented worshippers praying to Padma-pani to be
delivered from fire, from sword, from captivity, from wild beasts, from
snakes, and from the skeleton <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Death</span> who is seen approaching.

The Caitya cave at _Karle_, near Poona, which I visited in 1876, is in
all its dimensions and arrangements similar to the Vi?va-karma cave at
Elora, but is still larger, finer, and more imposing. It has a nave and
side aisles, terminating in an apse, round which the aisle is carried.
The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> is about 124 feet <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> by 45½ feet broad and 46 feet in
height. There are fifteen pillars on each side, separating the nave from
the aisles, and under the dome of the apse is the Dagaba (or Caitya)—a
two-storied cylindrical drum, surmounted by a Tee ornament (p. 456), on
which is a wooden umbrella. There is a cavity in the Dagaba for relics,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> none are now to be found there.

This wonderful excavation at Karle is one of the most magnificent
monuments of <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> Buddhism, and one of the most interesting examples
of early Buddhistic <span class="t1 t3 t4 t7 t8 t14 t15 t16 t17 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">art</span> to be seen anywhere in India. And, more than
this, it is probably one of the most striking places of congregational
<span class="t0 t5 t11 hoverable">worship</span> to be seen anywhere in the world.

Of course these rock-excavated churches soon developed into temples
(Viharas) built of stone or brick, some of which were of a monumental
character, like that at Buddha-Gaya, already described (see p. 390),
while others were unpretending structures near villages, where the laity
could repeat their prayers or make offerings. Others, again, formed the
most important edifice among the group of buildings constituting a
monastery.

The village temples might more suitably be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> chapels. All have some
features in common. At the further end of a dimly-lighted room is an
altar of stone or wood. On this are placed the idols, and around them
are arranged vases and cups, in which the offerings of the laity are
deposited. The larger edifices have vestibules, and at the entrance are
generally rude images of the four <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> kings (p. 206), who are supposed
to be the guardians of Buddhism (p. 206), while inside there are
sculptures, frescoes, and pictures illustrative of the various births
and transmigrations of the Buddhas and Bodhi-sattvas. In the precincts
is always to be found a Bodhi-tree (Bo-tree, p. 519), if the climate and
soil will admit of its being reared. The greater <span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span> of sacred
structures, however, even those of a more important <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> and more
entitled to be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> temples, are mere square or oblong rectangular
buildings, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> architectural design or ornamentation.

In Ceylon I visited a temple of this <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> on the shore of the Kandy
lake. It consisted of a large bare room or small hall, at the further
end of which was a curtain concealing a highly venerated image of the
Buddha. The attendant drew aside the curtain and showed us the image,
which had representations of rays of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> issuing from all parts of his
body, as <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as five rays emerging from the crown of his head. In the
enclosure or ‘compound’ of the temple, was a bell-shaped Dagaba or
relic-shrine of solid brick-work, covered with Chunam, and having a
receptacle for lights in front of it. Close at <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> was the usual sacred
Pipal-tree.

At _Kelani_, about eight miles from Colombo, is a larger and much more
important temple which I also visited. Those who make pilgrimages to

image of the Buddha, thirty-six feet long, lying on his right side, and
representing the founder of Buddhism when about to <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t11 t12 t19 t22 hoverable">pass</span> into
Pari-nirva?a (see p. 50). The image is protected by a screen, in the
centre of which is a figure of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span> of Serpents, while at the sides
are gigantic images of the temple-guardians. Around the interior are
fresco paintings of various incidents in the previous lives of the
Buddha. There are also images of the Hindu <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> Vish?u, ?iva, and Ga?e?a
(see p. 206). In the garden of the temple are residences for the monks,
a cloister-like enclosure, a room with a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> printing press, and an
immense Pipal-tree.

A still more important temple is that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the Dalada Maligawa or
temple of the sacred eye-tooth, at Kandy in Ceylon. This is a very
picturesque structure, situated on the margin of the lake close to the
town. It has no surrounding walls, and is easily accessible to all
comers. Steps lead up to a <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of open corridor, in which is the main
entrance, and the walls of which are decorated with coloured frescoes of
the eight principal hells—the supposed abode of evil-doers undergoing
purgatorial torments during one of their states of existence (see p.
120)[238].

Some are represented in the act of being cut in pieces by demons, or
fixed on red-hot iron spikes, or torn asunder with glowing tongs, or
sawn in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> with saws, or crushed between rocks, or consumed by flames
entering the apertures of their bodies. The European visitor inquires
with amazement how it is that a system so mild, merciful, and tolerant,
should have invented the horrible tortures here exhibited. The
explanation is not difficult, and his astonishment ceases when he is
reminded that Buddhism, recognizing no moral Governor of the Universe,
is compelled to resort to such artifices for the coercion and
intimidation of evil-doers.

In the interior of the building is the shrine, in which is preserved
behind iron bars, the golden Dagaba or receptacle of one of the Buddha’s
eye-teeth (see p. 500). On each side are images, and when I visited the
shrine, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> chamber was redolent with the fragrance of masses of
flowers—chiefly jasmine—recently deposited before them as offerings.

Behind the building I found an open quadrangle with cells for the monks,
and a residence for the <span class="t1 t4 t9 t16 hoverable">Head</span> of the monastery. Not far from the entrance
was a spacious library, where I was greeted by a <span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span> of youthful
monks, dressed in simple toga-like vestments, but with their right
shoulders <span class="t1 t7 t12 t29 hoverable">left</span> bare. Some were engaged in writing. I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> asked for
a specimen of their penmanship. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Upon</span> which they wrote down for me on
palm leaves, in the Sinhalese character, forty-eight epithets of the
Buddha, such as the following:—God of the gods, Indra of Indras, Brahma
of Brahmas, the Almighty, Omniscient, Existing in his own Law, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> of

The temples in Burma are commonly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> ‘pagodas,’ a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> corrupted
from the Pali Dagaba (Sansk?it Dhatu-garbha), ‘receptacle of the
(sacred) elements’ or relics of the body. They are also <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Dagohn.
According to Mr. Scott (‘Burman,’ i. 184), the <span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span> of temples in
Burma far exceeds those in Ceylon or Tibet or China. No village so poor
as to be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> its ‘neatly kept shrine, with the remains of others
mouldering away around it; no hill so steep as to be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> its

simple construction, others elaborate; but of all the temples the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>
Rangoon pagoda is the grandest and most crowded with worshippers and
pilgrims.

The peculiar sacredness and popularity of this wonderful structure (said
to have been founded 588 B.C.), arises from its containing relics of
Gautama and his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> predecessors, that is, eight hairs from Gautama’s
head, the staff of Ka?yapa, the robe of Kanaka-muni, and the
drinking-cup of Kraku-cchanda (see p. 135 of these Lectures). The
stately pile stands <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> a mound—partly natural, partly artificial—cut
into <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> rectangular terraces one above the other, the upper being 166
feet above the ground, and each side facing one of the cardinal points
of the compass. The ascent is by very dilapidated steps, some of stone,
some of ‘sun-dried bricks, worn almost into a slope by the bare feet of
myriads of worshippers.’ None but Europeans may ascend with covered
feet. The stairs lead to a ‘broad, open flagged space, which runs all
round the pagoda, and is <span class="t1 t7 t12 t29 hoverable">left</span> <span class="t1 t8 hoverable">free</span> for worshippers.’ From the centre of
this springs, from an octagonal plinth, the ‘profusely gilt _solid
brick_ pagoda,’ which has a circumference of 1355 feet, and rises to a
height of about 328, ‘or nearly as <span class="t17 t29 hoverable">high</span> as St. Paul’s cathedral.’ On the
summit is ‘the Tee,’ a gilt umbrella-shaped ornament with many tiers of
rings, on each of which ‘hang multitudes of gold and silver jewelled
bells.’ It was ‘placed there at a cost of not much less than
£50,000[239].’ At the foot of the pagoda are four chapels, having
colossal figures of <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> at the sides, and their gilded interiors
darkened by the vapour of thousands of burning tapers. ‘Hundreds of
Gautamas,’ large and small, white and black, gilded and plain, sitting,
standing, and reclining, surround the larger images. It is said that the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> pagoda has been thrice covered with gold-leaf.

There is a still <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> pagoda (332 feet high) at Pegu, and the most
<span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> of all is at Arakan.

Passing to Northern Buddhist countries, we <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> that the temples are
generally simple, and not to be compared with the grand pagodas of
Burma.

For example, at Tassiding in Sikkim, Sir Richard Temple (Journal, ii.
204) found that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> principal temples were chapel-like structures
with ‘overshadowing umbrella-shaped roofs, thatched with split bamboos.’
The walls were of rough stone, the upper half being painted red. The
interiors, which were dimly lighted, had <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> stories, the walls being
covered with coloured frescoes illustrating the punishments in the
various hells, ‘some of which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be suitable for illustrations of
Dante’s Inferno.’ The ends opposite to the entrance were filled with
images. In other parts of the chapels were praying-machines, and on
shelves the remnants of a library of sacred Buddhist manuscripts. Sir
Richard attended a religious service in one of these chapels, which
consisted of a series of chants and invocations to a female demon <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span>
Tanma, represented by a hideous lay figure dressed in robes. According
to tradition, it was the malevolent action of the twelve Tanmas in
bringing pestilences on the Tibetans, that led them to send for
Padma-sambhava, who introduced the debased Buddhism subsequently
prevalent in Tibet (Note by Capt. R. C. Temple).

According to Dr. Schlagintweit (p. 189) and Koeppen the generality of
temples in Mongolia and Tibet consist of one large square or rectangular
room, with an entrance-hall or vestibule, which in Mongolia looks to the
south and in Tibet to the east. ‘The inside surface is whitewashed or
covered with a <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of plaster,’ and decorated with paintings
representing episodes <span class="t2 t5 t11 t18 t19 t23 t26 hoverable">taken</span> from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of the Buddhas, or with
pictures of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> and goddesses of terrible aspect. Generally images of
the four <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> kings are placed here as guardians of the sanctuary (p.
206 of this volume). Sometimes there are side chambers, which may be
compared to transepts, and give the building the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of a cross. These
chambers often have shelves for the sacred books, wrapped in silk. In
the corners are tables for images of the deities, religious dresses,
musical instruments, etc. Other articles required for the daily service
are hung up on wooden pegs along the walls. Benches for the Lamas are
placed in the hall of the temple.

The altar at the further extremity rises in steps made of wood,
beautifully carved and richly ornamented. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Upon</span> these are arranged images
of the Buddhas and Bodhi-sattvas, and especially the chief idol
representing Gautama <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> in some of his forms and attitudes. Here
also are vessels for offerings, bells, Dorjes (p. 323), and other
utensils <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">used</span> in religious worship. Among the latter may be seen the
mirror (Melong, see p. 463) <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">used</span> in the ceremony described at p. 335.
There is also a vase with peacock’s feathers, and a sacred <span class="t6 t8 t10 t11 t16 t20 t21 t27 t28 hoverable">book</span> is never
wanting.

The vessels for offerings are of brass, and like tea-cups. They are
usually filled with barley, butter, and perfumes, and in summer with
flowers. Near at <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> is a Chorten (p. 380) containing relics, and
having a niche with the image of a <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> or Bodhi-sattva, to whom the
temple may perhaps be dedicated.

Finally, in the entrance-vestibule, at both sides of the door, as <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span>
as in the interior, stand rows of large and small prayer-cylinders,
which are perpetually kept revolving by the attendant Lamas.

Of course the temples at the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> centres of Tibetan Buddhism in and
near Lhassa, Tashi Lunpo, and other important places, are far more
imposing. Indeed, for magnificence, few religious edifices in any part
of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> can compare with them.

The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> temple (called _Cho Khang_) in the monastery of _La brang_ at
Lhassa is a <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of centre of the Lamistic Church. It is the first and
oldest temple, and, as before stated (p. 440), the St. Peter’s of
Lamism[240].

The facade of this vast structure looks to the east, and in front of it
is a square place, with a <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of obelisk or monolith, commemorating the
victory of the Tibetans over the Chinese in the ninth century, as <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span>
as more recent treaties of peace and friendship between the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span>
countries. The main building is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> stories high. Before the entrance
stands a lofty flag-pole, forty feet high[241], and not far off is a
poplar, said to have sprung ‘from the consecrated hair of Buddha.’ The
portico of the temple consists of a colonnade of six thick wooden
columns. The walls of the portico are covered with rude paintings,
representing scenes in the biography of Gautama Buddha. In the middle
are folding doors adorned with bronze carvings in relief. Through these
is the entrance into the front hall, over which is the first story. In
the wall opposite to the entrance is a <span class="t0 t2 t5 t13 t14 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">second</span> door, on each side of
which stand <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> colossal statues of the four <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> kings (see pp. 23,
51, 53, 54 of this volume).

This <span class="t0 t2 t5 t13 t14 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">second</span> door leads into the interior of the building. On entering,
the visitor finds himself in a vast temple, shaped like a basilica,
divided by rows of columns into <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> naves and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> transepts. The broad
central nave is lighted from above by transparent oil-cloth instead of
glass. This is the only <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> which finds its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> into the temple, as
there are no side windows. On the outside of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> secondary naves is
a row of small chapels, fourteen on one side and fourteen on the other.
The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> transepts <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> the back-ground of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> hall, and are
separated from the naves by a silver lattice-work. Here, at the ordinary
services, are the seats of the inferior monks. From the west transept a
staircase leads to another pillared transept, which forms the vestibule
of the sanctuary. In the middle of the sanctuary, which is square in
form, is the altar for offerings. Beyond the altar, at the west side of
the sanctuary, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> in the furthest recess of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span>
building, is a quadrangular niche. In front of this niche on the <span class="t1 t7 t12 t29 hoverable">left</span> is
the throne of the Dalai Lama, very lofty, richly adorned and furnished
with five cushions, as is customary in the <span class="t5 t16 t21 t24 t25 hoverable">case</span> of Grand Lamas. On one
side of the Dalai Lama’s throne is a similar throne for the Panchen
Lama, and then, in regular order, the thrones of the Khutuktus and other
Avatara Lamas. The Khanpos and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> non-Avatara monkhood have seats
in the transept.

Opposite to the throne of the Dalai Lama, on the right of the niche, is
the chair of the Regent, which is less elevated than the thrones of the
Avatara Lamas. Behind are the seats of the four ministers, which again
are less elevated than those of the non-Avatara Lamas. At the west end
of the niche is the <span class="t17 t29 hoverable">high</span> altar, which rises in numerous steps. On the
upper steps are small images of deified saints, in massive gold or
silver. On the lower ones, as on all Buddhist altars, are lamps,
incense-holders, bowls for offerings, etc. On the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t22 t23 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">highest</span> elevation,
behind silver and golden lattice-work, is the celebrated image of
Gautama <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> richly gilded. This image is said to have been
constructed in Magadha during the lifetime of the Buddha. Others hold it
to be self-produced; and another tradition ascribes its origin to the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">god</span> Vi?va-karma, who, instructed by Indra, constructed it with equal
parts of five metals and five precious stones. Besides this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t22 t23 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">highest</span>
<span class="t24 t25 hoverable">object</span> of worship, the temple contains countless images and pictures of
Buddhas and Bodhi-sattvas (such as Dipa?kara, Amitabha, Maitreya, the
eleven-faced Avalokite?vara, Mañju-?ri, etc.), besides <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> and
goddesses[242], and historical personages, such as Tsong Khapa, who have
benefited the Lamistic church (among them being a statue of Hiouen
Thsang), as <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as relics, and gold and silver vessels, which are
exhibited every year at the beginning of the <span class="t26 hoverable">third</span> month.

Mr. Sarat Chandra Das, who, in his ‘Narrative,’ records his visit to the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Lhassa temple, informs us that when he was there, five <span class="t6 hoverable">thousand</span>
oil-burners were lighted in the court of the temple, and those before
the principal image were all of gold. He found some of the subordinate
chapels infested by mice, which are never touched, because supposed to
be metamorphosed monks. He observed some Buddhists from Nepal chanting
Sansk?it hymns, and others engaged in circumambulation, while the
muttering of Om Ma?i padme Hum (p. 372) was incessant.

Mr. Sarat Chandra Das also describes a visit he paid to the famous
shrine of _Ramoche_, before adverted to (see p. 441). I give his
description in an abbreviated form:—

  Our equipment was as usual a bundle of incense-sticks, clarified
  butter, and a few scarves. Our road turned westward by the side of a
  <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> Mandong (see p. 380). I <span class="t1 t7 t12 t29 hoverable">left</span> it to my right-hand side, seeing
  that to have kept it on my <span class="t1 t7 t12 t29 hoverable">left</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have been heretical. A few
  hundred paces <span class="t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> us to the gate of the famous temple of Ramoche,
  erected by the wife of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span> Srong Tsan Gampo, the first Chinese
  princess who introduced Buddhism into Tibet. It is a lofty edifice,
  flat-roofed, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> stories high, surrounded by a stone wall, with
  a <span class="t17 t29 hoverable">high</span> and wide porch. About thirty monks were solemnly seated to
  perform a religious service, on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> sides of a row of pillars which
  supported the roof. The image <span class="t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> by the Nepalese princess, lay
  midway between the pillars. It was grand-looking; and, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> its <span class="t3 hoverable">face</span>
  was gilded, its antiquity was manifest. In the northern lobby of the
  temple was a vast collection of <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> relics, such as shields,
  spears, drums, arrows, sabres, <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> knives, trumpets, etc. In a room
  to the <span class="t1 t7 t12 t29 hoverable">left</span> of the entrance, enclosed by iron lattice-work, were a few
  images considered especially sacred. We were also shown a brass
  mirror, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Melong, said to be possessed of wonderful properties.

The history of the shrine, according to the same traveller, is this:—The
princess being thoroughly versed in astrology, found that there was a
spot close to the new-built <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">city</span> of Lhassa which was connected with the
lower regions of torment. On that plot of ground she erected the shrine
of Ramoche, on the chief altar of which she placed the famous statue of
Buddha, <span class="t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> from China. In this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> she hoped to intercept the
<span class="t28 hoverable">passage</span> (_gati_) of wicked <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> to a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> in one of the hells (see p.
121). Whoever, at the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of death, was <span class="t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> to this sanctuary,

Mr. Bogle (Markham’s Tibet, p. 100) describes the temple in the
monastery at Tashi Lunpo as simply a <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> room or gallery containing
thirteen gigantic figures made of copper gilt, all in a sedent attitude,
with their legs folded under them. He found them all draped, with
jewelled crowns and necklaces of coral, pearls, and other stones. The
thrones on which they sat were also of copper gilt, and adorned with
turquoises and cornelians. Behind them were a variety of conch-shells,
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> in silver, ostrich-eggs, cocoa-nuts, and other articles. At each end
of the gallery was a large collection of books deposited in
pigeon-holes. Mr. Bogle was present when the Tashi Lama himself entered
the temple, and, as he passed along, sprinkled rice <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the images.
This was a <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of consecration-ceremony.

As an instance of the tolerant character of Buddhism and its readiness
to accommodate itself to the indigenous creeds of the countries into
which it was introduced, we may note, in conclusion, that in Japan may
be seen Buddhist and Shinto temples side by side or even occasionally
combined in one building. Buddhism in <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> adopted Shintoism in Japan
just as it adopted Shamanism in Tibet. It <span class="t2 t4 t6 t9 t18 t19 t22 hoverable">took</span> the deities and demi-gods
of Shintoism and turned them into Bodhi-sattvas[243].

The subject of Monasteries and Temples naturally leads us to that of
images and image-worship; but this and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> subject of ‘Sacred

                              LECTURE XVI.
                          _Images and Idols._


On several occasions during my travels through all parts of India, I
asked intelligent Pa??its how they could reconcile the gross idolatry
and fetish-worship which meet the eye at almost every step throughout
the length and breadth of their land, with the doctrine repeatedly
declared to be the only <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> creed of Brahmanism—the doctrine that
nothing really exists but the one eternal, omnipresent <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Spirit</span> of the
Universe (named <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> or Brahma)[244].

The answer I generally received to this inquiry was, that <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span>
<span class="t0 t5 t11 hoverable">worship</span> was at first the only <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of religion dominant in India, till
the Buddhists <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> the example of worshipping material objects and images
(pratima-puja).

Of course it is impossible to say what amount of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> there may be in
this accusation. It seems probable that material impersonations of the
forces of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> existed before the Buddha’s time. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> there is no
evidence of the prevalence of actual idolatry at the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> when the
?ig-veda was composed. Nor is there any very clear allusion to it in
Manu. Nor have any images of Hindu <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> been found which are so <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span>
as some Buddhist images. At the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> nothing is said about
image-worship in the Buddhist Pi?akas. The statement that the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span>
himself sanctioned idolatry is wholly legendary (see p. 177). Nor is
there any proof that carved images of his <span class="t0 t4 t5 t10 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">person</span> were common in India
till several centuries after his death.

The Bharhut sculptures of about the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t13 t14 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">second</span> century B.C.—though
representing many scenes connected with the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> (see pp. 408,
523)—exhibit no representations of the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> himself. Nor are there any
on the Sanchi gateway of still later date.

The only objects of reverence in the Bharhut sculptures, according to
Sir A. Cunningham, are Bodhi-trees, Wheels, the Tri-ratna symbol,
Stupas, and foot-prints (see pp. 521-522 of these Lectures). The
bas-reliefs on the railing at the Buddha-Gaya Temple, which is of a
little earlier date, agree in making the Tree, Wheel, Tri-ratna, and
Stupa the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> objects of reverence. On the other hand, in the edicts
of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> A?oka veneration for the Bodhi-tree alone is enjoined. Among the
historical scenes represented in the Bharhut sculptures, are the
processions of the kings Ajata-?atru and Prasenajit on their visits to
the Buddha; ‘the former on his elephant, the latter in his chariot,
exactly as they are described in the Buddhist chronicles.’ There are
also bas-reliefs which seem to represent Rama, during his exile, besides
images of other gods, Yakshas and Nagas, but no figure of <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> himself
is to be seen anywhere.

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> it is undeniable that in the early centuries of our era, images of
Gautama <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> and other Buddhas and Bodhi-sattvas had become common
among the Buddhists in every part of India.

[Illustration: REMAINS OF A COLOSSAL STATUE OF BUDDHA, PROBABLY ONCE IN
THE ARGUMENTATIVE OR TEACHING ATTITUDE.]

 Found in the ruins close to the south side of the Buddha-Gaya temple,
the date (S. 64 = A.D. 142) being inscribed on the pedestal. (see p. 481)

One of the oldest statues of the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> that has <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> been <span class="t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> to
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> is the colossal image (now in the Calcutta Museum) dug up in the
ruins outside the <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> temple at Buddha-Gaya (p. 390), the date
inscribed on which corresponds to about A.D. 142. The engraving
(opposite) is from a photograph of this statue, belonging to Sir A.
Cunningham[245]. The thick lips are certainly remarkable. The attitude
was probably the ‘argumentative’ or ‘teaching’ (described at p. 481).
Another colossal statue of about the same date was found by Sir A.
Cunningham at ?ravasti (see p. 408).

It was indeed by a strange irony of fate that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> who denied any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">god</span>
or any being <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> than himself, and told his followers to look to
themselves alone for salvation, should have been not only deified and
worshipped, but represented by more images than any other being ever
idolized in any part of the world. In <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> images, statues, statuettes,
carvings in bas-relief, paintings, and representations of him in all
attitudes are absolutely innumerable. In caves, monasteries, and
temples, on Dagabas, votive Stupas, monuments and rocks, they are
multiplied infinitely and in endless variety, and not only are isolated
images manufactured out of all kinds of materials, but rows on rows are
sculptured in relief, and the greater the <span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span> the greater religious
merit accrues to the sculptor, and—if they are dedicated at sacred
places—to the dedicator also.

And not only images of the Buddha, but representations of every <span class="t24 t25 hoverable">object</span>
that could possibly be connected with him, became multiplied to an
indefinite extent.

The gradual growth of what may be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> objective Buddhism, and the
steps which led to every <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of extravagance in the idolatrous <span class="t1 hoverable">use</span> of
images, may be described in the following manner:—

It was only natural that the disciples of an ideally perfect man, who
had taught them that in passing away at <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> become absolutely
extinct, should have devised some method of perpetuating his memory and
stimulating a <span class="t0 t10 t11 t17 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">desire</span> to conform to his example. Their first method was
to preserve the relics of his burnt body, and to honour every <span class="t24 t25 hoverable">object</span>
associated with his earthly career. Then, in process of time, they began
to <span class="t0 t5 t11 hoverable">worship</span> not only his relics but the receptacles under which they were
buried, and around these they placed sculptures commemorative of his
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> and teaching. Thence they passed on to the carving or moulding of
small statuettes of his <span class="t0 t4 t5 t10 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">person</span> in wood, stone, metal, terra-cotta, or
clay, and on these they often inscribed the well-known Buddhistic
formulæ mentioned before (see p. 104). Eventually, too, painting was
pressed into the service, and frescoes on walls became common. Indeed in
some temples paintings <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> of images, as objects of
adoration.

It seems likely that the <span class="t1 hoverable">use</span> of images and paintings was at first
confined to the brotherhood, and it is alleged that they were only
honoured and not worshipped. But the more the circle of uncultured and
unthinking Buddhists became enlarged, the more did visible
representations of the founder of Buddhism become needed, and the more
they became multiplied.

Nor was this all. The reaction from the original simplicity of Buddhism
led to a complete repudiation of its anti-theistic doctrines. It adopted
polytheistic superstitions even more rapidly and thoroughly than
Brahmanism did. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">People</span> were not satisfied with representations of the
founder of Buddhism. They craved for other visible and tangible objects
of adoration—for the images of other Buddhas and Bodhi-sattvas—of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span>
many and lords many—insomuch that a Buddhist Pantheon was gradually
created which became peopled with a more motley crowd of occupants than
that of Brahmanism and Hinduism.

Furthermore, it was only natural that the manufacture of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> array
of divinities and semi-divinities, of saints and sages, should have been
committed to the monks. They alone possessed this privilege. They alone,
too, had the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of consecrating each image by the repetition of
mystical <span class="t9 t12 t13 t25 hoverable">texts</span> and formularies. And when images and idols were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span>
consecrated, they were believed to be animated with the spirit, and to
possess all the attributes of the <span class="t0 t1 t15 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> they represented.

In fact, the development of every phase of idolatrous superstition
reached a point of extravagance unparalleled in any other religious
system of the world. The monks of Buddhism vied with each other in the
‘pious fraud’ with which they constructed their idols. They so
manipulated them that they appeared to give out <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> or to flash
supernatural glances from their crystal eyes. Or they made them deliver
oracular utterances, or they furnished them with movable limbs, so that
a <span class="t1 t4 t9 t16 hoverable">head</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> unexpectedly nod, or a <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> be raised to bless the
worshipper. Then they clothed them with costly vestments, and adorned
them with ornaments and jewels, and treated them in every <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> as if they
were living energizing personalities.

It ought, however, to be noted here, that in some temples images of the
Buddhas and Bodhi-sattvas were said to exist which were not manufactured
or consecrated by monks. They were believed to have been self-produced,
or to have been created supernaturally out of nothing, or to have
emerged in a miraculous manner out of vacuity. The child-like <span class="t7 t13 t19 t20 t29 hoverable">faith</span> of
uncultured and imaginative races in the virtue supposed to be inherent
in such images was perhaps not surprising. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of working all
kinds of miracles was gradually ascribed to them; sicknesses were said
to be healed by them, rain to be produced, and the course of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span>
itself to be subject to their direction and control.

The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> Chinese pilgrims Fa-hien and Hiouen Thsang are never tired of
describing the wonders supposed to have been wrought by the statues and
idols they saw during their travels, especially by the marvellous
sandal-wood statue mentioned before (see p. 408).

The following tradition in regard to this image, narrated by Fa-hien
(Legge, 56, 57), is especially interesting as showing that the general
belief among all classes of Buddhists in his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> was, that Gautama
<span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> himself was the first to sanction the making of visible
representations of himself:—

  When <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> up to the Trayastri??a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heaven</span> and preached the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">law</span>
  for the benefit of his mother for ninety days, Prasenajit longing to
  see him, caused an image to be carved in Go?irsha sandal-wood, and put
  in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> where he usually sat. When Buddha, on his return, entered
  the Vihara, this image immediately <span class="t1 t7 t12 t29 hoverable">left</span> its place, and came forth to
  meet him. <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> then said to it: ‘Return to your seat. After I have
  attained Pari-nirva?a you shall serve as a pattern to the four classes
  (paths, see p. 132) of my disciples.’ Thereupon the image returned to
  its seat. This was the very first of all the images of Buddha, and
  that which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> subsequently copied.

In Hiouen Thsang’s narrative, which is of much later date (see p. 413),
we <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> the following <span class="t1 t11 t12 t13 t16 t18 t21 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of this celebrated sandal-wood image
(Beal, ii. 322):—

  At the town of Pima (Pi-mo) there is a figure of <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> in a standing
  position made of sandal-wood. The figure is about twenty feet high. It
  <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t7 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">works</span> many miracles, and reflects constantly a bright light. Those who
  have any disease, according to the part affected, cover the
  corresponding <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> on the statue with gold-leaf, and forthwith they
  are healed. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">People</span> who address prayers to it, with a sincere heart,
  mostly obtain their wishes. This is what the natives say: ‘This image
  in old days, when <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> was alive, was made by Udayana, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span> of
  Kau?ambi (see p. 412 of these Lectures). When <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> <span class="t1 t7 t12 t29 hoverable">left</span> the world,
  it mounted of its own accord into the air, and came to the north of
  this kingdom to the town of Ho-lo-lo-kia (Urgha?).’

With regard to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> and character of the countless images now
scattered everywhere, they vary according to country and period (see p.
485). It should be observed, however, that Buddhism, when it began to
encourage idolatry, did not make it hideous by giving monstrous shapes
to its idols. In this respect early Buddhism contrasted very favourably
with Hinduism. Nor did the Buddhists of India, as of other countries,
adopt the practice of endowing their idols with extra heads and arms to
symbolize power, or of inventing grotesque combinations of the <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span>
figure with the shapes of elephants, birds, serpents, and other animals.
They seemed rather to have tried in the first instance to neutralize the
tendency to extravagant symbolism common among all Eastern peoples, by
delineating their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> teacher as an ideal man, simply and naturally
formed, according to the Buddhist ideal of perfection with symmetrical
limbs, and a dignified, calm, passionless, and majestic bearing. What
can be a greater contrast than the four-armed elephant-headed
village-god of India,—Ga?e?a, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> of ?iva[246]—and the purely <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span>
figure of the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> as shown in his statues!

Nevertheless it must be admitted that in process of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> the
representations of Gautama <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> developed certain peculiar varieties
of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> as <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as differences in attitude. These differences, indeed,
constitute a highly interesting topic of inquiry, and perhaps deserve
more attention than they have hitherto received in any treatise with
which I am acquainted.

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Without</span> going minutely into every point, we may begin by noting a few
general characteristics common to all the Buddha’s images.

In the first place, they all represent Gautama as clothed—not naked. In
this respect they present a pleasant contrast to the images of Jaina
saints; for, as already pointed out, Gautama discountenanced all
extremes of bodily mortification, and disapproved the practice of going
about nude, according to the custom of Hindu devotees. In the
Dharma-pada it is said, ‘Not nakedness, not matted hair, not dirt, not
fasting, nor lying on the ground, nor smearing with ashes, nor sitting
motionless can purify a mortal who has not overcome desires.’

Gautama’s robe was drawn gracefully over his shoulders like a toga, but
probably the right shoulder was always <span class="t1 t7 t12 t29 hoverable">left</span> bare on formal occasions.
The Pi?akas give no clear information as to this point. In Indian
statues the robe is sometimes represented as fitting so closely to the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> that the figure seems garmentless[247]; its presence being merely
denoted by a line running diagonally over the <span class="t1 t7 t12 t29 hoverable">left</span> shoulder across the
breast, and under the right arm. This line frequently looks so like a
cord that some have mistaken it for the thread to which, as a Kshatriya,
<span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> was entitled[248]. In some <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> images no trace of the line is
left, but they are not really nude. Most Indian images have the right
shoulder bare (even in the <span class="t5 t16 t21 t24 t25 hoverable">case</span> of nuns). Of course in colder climates
both shoulders are covered. Even in Southern countries some have both
shoulders covered, or the right partially so.

In contradistinction to the clothed images of the Buddha, all the
representations of his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> opponent and rival Deva-datta (see pp. 52,
405) make the latter unclothed, like a Jaina ascetic, or only partially
clothed up to the waist. Deva-datta is also represented as shorter in
stature than the Buddha.

Other characteristics generally to be observed in the earlier images of
Gautama <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> are:—the impassive tranquil features, typical of complete
conquest over the passions, and of perfect repose; the absence of all
decoration and ornament; the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> pendulous ears, which occasionally
reach to the shoulders[249]; the circle or small globe or lotus[250], or
auspicious mark of some kind, on the palm or palms of the supinated
<span class="t20 hoverable">hands</span> (as <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as often on the soles of the feet), and the short knobby
hair, often carved so as to resemble a close-fitting curly wig.

It must not be forgotten that Gautama signalized his renunciation of the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> by cutting off his hair with a sword, and the resulting stumps are
said to have turned into permanent knobs or short curls[251].

In images <span class="t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> from Burma and Siam a curious horn-like protuberance
on the crown of the head—either tapering to a point, or rounded off at
the extremity—is noticeable. Often, too, sculptures found in India show
the rounded <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of this excrescence.

Some think that it represents an ascetic’s mass of hair coiled up in a
top-knot on the crown of the head, as in images of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">god</span> ?iva. Others
regard it as the rough outline of what ought to be an Ush?isha or
peculiar crown-like head-dress, such as may be seen in many later images
of the Buddha. Some legends declare that the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> was <span class="t9 t24 hoverable">born</span> with this
Ush?isha, which was indicative of his future supremacy.

Others, again, maintain that this protuberance (sometimes lengthened out
so as to be as <span class="t17 t29 hoverable">high</span> as the <span class="t1 t4 t9 t16 hoverable">head</span> itself) was a peculiar growth of the
skull, and one of the marks of a supreme <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> indicative of
supernatural intelligence; just as in other images (especially those
<span class="t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> from Ceylon) five flames—in shape like the fingers of a hand—are
represented issuing from the crown of the <span class="t1 t4 t9 t16 hoverable">head</span> (see p. 453), to typify
the Buddha’s diffusion of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> throughout the world.

It is said that this outgrowth of the Buddha’s skull has been preserved
as a sacred relic in a town of Afghanistan near Jalalabad.

In many representations of the Buddha, a Nimbus or aureola of <span class="t3 t22 t28 hoverable">glory</span>
encircles the <span class="t1 t4 t9 t16 hoverable">head</span> (see p. 478), and in some images rays of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> are
represented as emerging from his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> body. An image with a halo of
this <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> surrounding the entire figure was seen by me in a temple near
Kandy in Ceylon (see p. 453).

In Nepal many images represent <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> holding his alms-bowl, but these
are not common in other places.

With regard to the size of the images, they vary from diminutive
examples, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> inches long, to colossal statues twelve,
eighteen, twenty, thirty, forty, or even seventy feet high. They are
generally carved in stone or marble, but sometimes in metal, sometimes
in wood, and occasionally moulded in clay.

Much difference of opinion prevails as to the Buddha’s actual stature.
When I asked the opinion of Buddhist teachers in Ceylon, they all agreed

eighteen-feet statues represent life-size. According to other legends
the Buddha’s stature reached to twenty cubits. In China, the mythical
history of <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> gives him a height of only sixteen feet[252]. His arms
are by some said to have been so long, that he was able to touch his
knees with his <span class="t20 hoverable">hands</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> stooping, and if we are to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> the
supposed impress of his foot on Adam’s Peak and in Siam as the measure
of his stature, he must have been the most gigantic giant that ever
lived. Even one of the most enlightened natives of Ceylon, the late Mr.
James d’Alwis—a convert to Christianity—told me, in explanation of the
abnormal size of the eye-tooth at Kandy, that he was convinced that all
<span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t0 t1 t15 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> were taller in Buddha’s time, and that Gautama was taller
than his fellow-men of those days, and was about eight feet high. It was
his opinion that as <span class="t2 t5 t8 t17 t18 t19 hoverable">sin</span> increases in the world, so men’s stature
decreases. Probably the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> was tall, even for the North-west of
India, where the average of a man’s stature is about five feet eight or
nine inches.

[Illustration: SCULPTURE FOUND BY SIR A. CUNNINGHAM AT SARNATH, NEAR
BENARES,]

  Illustrating the four principal events in Gautama Buddha’s life—his
  birth from his mother’s side, his attainment of Buddhahood under the
    tree, his teaching at Benares, and his passing away in complete
            Nirva?a. (Date of the sculpture, about 400 A.D.)

As to the attitudes of Gautama’s images, they may be classed under the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> heads of sedent, erect, and recumbent. I <span class="t1 hoverable">use</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> ‘sedent’ for
what ought to be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> a squatting position, with the legs folded under
the body. Images which represent a figure sitting in European fashion
are rare.

Four principal images represent the four principal events in Buddha’s
life, as shown in the Sarnath sculpture engraved on the opposite page
(compare p. 387).

The first sedent attitude may be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the ‘Meditative.’ The example
below is described at p. xxx. 15.

[Illustration: ]

This represents the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> seated, in meditation, on a raised seat under
the sacred tree, with the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> <span class="t20 hoverable">hands</span> supinated, one over the other.

[Illustration: ]

The <span class="t0 t2 t5 t13 t14 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">second</span> sedent attitude may be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the ‘Witness-attitude.’ It is
perhaps the most esteemed of all, and is represented in a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> sculpture
delineated below (from Sir A. Cunningham’s photograph, see p. xxx. 17).
This represents Gautama at the moment of achieving Buddhahood after his
<span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> course of meditation, seated on a lion-throne (si?hasana) with an
ornamental back, having <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> lions carved below (compare p. 394). His
legs are folded in the usual Indian fashion, the feet being turned
upwards, while the right <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> hangs over the right leg and points to the
earth, and the <span class="t1 t7 t12 t29 hoverable">left</span> <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> is supinated on the <span class="t1 t7 t12 t29 hoverable">left</span> foot. He has an
aureola round his <span class="t1 t4 t9 t16 hoverable">head</span> and a mark—perhaps the caste-mark of a
Kshatriya—on his forehead, and an umbrella over the sacred tree. This
attitude is <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> shown in the Sarnath sculpture (facing p. 477).

The tradition is that at the moment of his enlightenment Gautama was
taunted by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> being Mara with being unable to give any proof or
sign of his Buddhahood. Thereupon Gautama pointed, not to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heaven</span> as a
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> might have done, but to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> beneath his feet, calling it
to witness. Then a six-fold earthquake and other miraculous phenomena
followed[253].

At this time, too, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> being Mara sent his enchanting daughters (p.
34) to seduce the Buddha. This is shown in the engraving facing p. 477.

The incident of calling the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> to witness is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> mentioned by Hiouen
Thsang:—

  In the Vihara, was found a beautiful figure of <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> in a sitting
  position, the right foot uppermost, the <span class="t1 t7 t12 t29 hoverable">left</span> <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> resting, the right
  <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> hanging down. He was sitting facing the east, and as dignified in
  appearance as when alive. The signs and marks of a <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> were
  perfectly drawn. The loving expression of his <span class="t3 hoverable">face</span> was like life. Now
  it happened that a ?rama?a, who was passing the night in the Vihara,
  had a dream, in which he saw a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> who said:—

  ‘I am Maitreya Bodhi-sattva. Fearing that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> of no artist could
  conceive the beauty of the sacred features, I myself have come to
  delineate the figure of Buddha. His right <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> hangs down, in token
  that when he was about to reach Buddhahood the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> Mara came to tempt
  him, saying, “Who will bear witness for you?” Then Tathagata dropped
  his <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> and pointed to the ground, saying, “Here is my witness.” On
  this an earth-spirit leapt forth to bear witness.’ (Beal’s Records,
  ii. 121, abridged.)

This ‘Witness-attitude’ is also shown in the annexed engraving from a
photograph of one of the only statues that remained in the exterior
niches of the <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> Buddha-Gaya temple before its restoration.

[Illustration: ]

The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> seal-like circles on each side contain the usual ‘Ye dharma’
formula (see p. 104 and p. xxx. 18).

The <span class="t26 hoverable">third</span> sedent pose or position may be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the ‘Serpent-canopied.’
This is commemorative of the legend that Gautama, when seated in
meditation after his attainment of Buddhahood, was sheltered from a
violent storm by the expanded hood of the Naga, or serpent-demon
Mucalinda (see p. 39), while the coils of the snake were wound round his
body, or gathered under him to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> a seat. Similarly the ascetic <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span>
of ?iva is often represented under a serpent-canopy.

Only one example of this has been found at Buddha-Gaya. Such images,
however, are common in the south, and their prevalence there is not
difficult to <span class="t1 t11 t12 t13 t16 t18 t21 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> for. Indeed, the connexion of Buddhism with the
serpent-worship of southern countries and with the Nagas of Hindu
mythology (see p. 220 of these Lectures), was one inevitable result of
its readiness to graft popular superstitions on its own doctrines[254].

I procured a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> specimen of the ‘Serpent-canopied’ <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> during my
stay in Ceylon. It is made of heavy brass, and curiously enough
represents <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> with an aquiline nose. It has the five rays of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span>
before alluded to (see pp. 453, 475) issuing from the crown of his head.
See the frontispiece opposite title-page.

In some images an umbrella alone, and in some, as at p. 478, both an
umbrella and tree <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> the canopy.

The fourth sedent posture may be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the ‘Argumentative’ (Tarka)
attitude (as shown in the engraving opposite p. 477). It represents
Gautama with the thumb and finger of the right <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> touching the fingers
of the left, and apparently going through the heads of his
doctrine[255], and enforcing it, as he usually did, by reiterations.
This is sometimes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the ‘Teaching’ attitude.

Often the ‘Ye dharma’ formula (see p. 104) is carved either under or at
the side of images in this attitude.

The fifth may be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the ‘Preaching’ attitude. It is often erect. The
<span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> has one finger raised in a didactic manner. Monks in the present
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> often read the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Law</span> and preach in the same manner.

The sixth attitude also—as a rule—comes under the erect class, and is
often scarcely to be distinguished from the last. It may be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the
‘Benedictive’ attitude (A?irvada). See the engraving opposite p. 477.

It represents the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> in the act of pronouncing a benediction, the
right <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> being raised. This attitude is sometimes sedent. Even to this
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> Buddhist monks bless laymen in a similar attitude. Occasionally the
figure with the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> upraised has a crown, and an ornamental head-dress;
but it may be <span class="t2 t5 t11 t18 t19 t23 t26 hoverable">taken</span> for granted that all images of the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> which
represent him with a crown of any <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> _after his attainment of
Buddhahood_, are comparatively modern and incorrect.

On the other hand, it is clear that even <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> sculptures, when they
represent him as a prince, may correctly give him decorations and a
head-dress.

The seventh attitude may be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the ‘Mendicant.’ This also is a
standing figure, holding a round alms-bowl in one hand, and sometimes
screening it with the other (compare p. 40). Examples of this attitude
are rare. There are no real mendicants in Buddhism. No monk ever begs,
he only receives alms.

The eighth and last attitude is recumbent, and this is perhaps as
important as the second, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> not so common (see the uppermost figure
opposite to p. 477). It represents the moribund Gautama lying down on
his right side, with his <span class="t1 t4 t9 t16 hoverable">head</span> turned towards the north, and his right
cheek resting on his right hand, about to <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t11 t12 t19 t22 hoverable">pass</span> away in the final
consummation of Pari-nirva?a (see pp. 50, 140). In many representations
of this attitude, the usual five rays of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> often mentioned before
are made to issue from the crown of the head. A colossal image of this
<span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> was seen by me in a temple near Colombo, and there is a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span>
example of it in the Indian Institute at Oxford[256]. In some carvings
of the dying <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> a few attendants are represented, who hold
umbrella-like canopies over the recumbent figure, or bow down
reverentially before it. It has been asserted that this scene—as
commemorative of the grand consummation of the Buddha’s career through
countless existences—is held in as much reverence by Buddhists as the
crucifixion is by Christians.

The representation of the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> in the act of being <span class="t9 t24 hoverable">born</span> is found in
sculptures and bas-reliefs, but is never found as a separate image. It
represents him springing out of the side of his mother (note, p. 180).
This birth-scene is occasionally carved on temples. It is shown in the
lower part of the engraving (opposite page 477). The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">god</span> Brahma is seen
receiving the new-born child, while Indra stands on his right and the
mother’s sister (i.e. nurse, p. 24) is on her left.

Some representations of the Buddha, or of certain forms of the
Buddha—such as Amitabha—show a sedent figure emerging from a
lotus-blossom, or seated on a pedestal formed of lotus-leaves, this
flower symbolizing perfection.

It must not be forgotten that in every country the images of the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span>
are generally moulded according to the type of countenance prevalent in
each country. Hence the contour and expression of <span class="t3 hoverable">face</span> differ in Ceylon,
Burma, Siam, Tibet, Mongolia, China, and Japan, although as a rule the
features are calm, mild, meditative, and passionless.

In Burma the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> are merry; hence the images sometimes have a twinkle
in the eye and smiling lips.

In China, again, examples sometimes occur of images which do not exhibit
<span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> as the ideal of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> who has conquered his passions, but rather
with the figure and features of a self-indulgent libertine[257]; while
others again portray him with a grim aspect.

We now <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t11 t12 t19 t22 hoverable">pass</span> on to the representations of other Buddhas, Bodhi-sattvas,
saints, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> and goddesses.

Often <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> other images are associated with that of Gautama <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span>
himself.

And, first of all, his image was joined with the other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> persons of
the earliest Triad (see p. 175), viz. Dharma (the Law) and Sa?gha (the
Monkhood). A sculpture, in a broken and imperfect condition,
representing this earliest Triad, and dating from the ninth to the tenth
century, was found at Buddha-Gaya. The image of Buddha, under an
umbrella-like tree, is in the centre; that of the Sa?gha is on his
right, with a full-blown lotus (p. 177, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">note</span> 2), and having one leg
hanging down, while that of Dharma (a female) is on his <span class="t1 t7 t12 t29 hoverable">left</span> with a
half-blown lotus. A drawing of this (from Sir A. Cunningham’s
photograph) is given below:—

[Illustration: ]

In Nepal the image of Dharma is always that of a sedent female, who is
supposed to be an embodiment of supreme <span class="t7 t8 t12 hoverable">wisdom</span> (prajña paramita), and
sometimes has four arms (see note, p. 178).

Next come the images of the Buddhas who preceded Gautama, especially
Ka?yapa Buddha, Kanaka-muni, and Kraku-cchanda. It is often mentioned
that the images of one or other of these three, as of the Bodhi-sattvas,
are <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> up side by side with that of Gautama.

Then, of course, there are the images of the five Dhyani-Buddhas.
Perhaps the commonest of these is that of Amitabha (see p. 203), but
images of Akshobhya and Ratna-sambhava are by no means rare.

Then as to the Bodhi-sattvas, of whom Maitreya is the first and the only
one worshipped by Buddhists of all countries (see p. 182), Fa-hien
records that he saw in Northern India a wooden image of Maitreya
Bodhi-sattva eighty cubits high, which on fast <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">days</span> emitted a brilliant
light. Offerings were constantly presented to it by the kings of
surrounding countries (Legge, 23).

Hiouen Thsang (Beal, i. 134) also describes this image of Maitreya as
very dazzling, and says it was the <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> of the Arhat Madhyantika, a
disciple of Ananda. He saw another image of Maitreya made of silver at
Buddha-Gaya, and another made of sandal-wood in Western India. The
latter also gave out a bright light. Probably these images were covered
with some <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of gilding.

In the present <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> the images of Maitreya often represent him with both
<span class="t20 hoverable">hands</span> raised, the fingers forming the lotus-shaped Mudra, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span>
yellow or gilded, and the hair short and curly.

Passing next to the images of the triad of mythical Bodhi-sattvas,
Mañju-?ri, Avalokite?vara, and Vajra-pa?i (p. 195), we may gather from
what has been already stated (p. 196), that the interaction of Buddhism
and Hinduism affected both the mythology and imagery of both systems.
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> it does not appear that the images of the Bodhi-sattva Mañju-?ri
were ever unnaturally distorted. They are quite as <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> and pleasant in
appearance as those of Gautama and Maitreya. In general Mañju-?ri
represented in a sedent attitude, with his <span class="t1 t7 t12 t29 hoverable">left</span> <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> holding a lotus,
and his right holding the sword of wisdom, with a shining blade to
dissipate the darkness of ignorance (see p. 201). His <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> ought to be
yellow.

It was not till the introduction of the <span class="t0 t5 t11 hoverable">worship</span> of Avalokite?vara that
the followers of <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> of endowing the figures of deified
saints with an extra <span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span> of heads and arms.

The process of Avalokite?vara’s (Padma-pa?i’s) <span class="t0 t1 t5 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">creation</span> and the
formation of his numerous heads by the Dhyani-Buddha Amitabha, is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span>
described (Schlagintweit, p. 84, abridged):—

  Once <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> Amitabha, after giving himself up to earnest
  meditation, caused a red ray of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> to issue from his right eye,
  which <span class="t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> Padma-pa?i Bodhi-sattva into existence; while from his
  <span class="t1 t7 t12 t29 hoverable">left</span> eye burst forth a blue ray of light, which becoming incarnate in
  the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> wives of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span> Srong Tsan (see p. 271), had <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> to enlighten
  the minds of <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> beings. Amitabha then <span class="t2 t15 t24 hoverable">blessed</span> Padma-pa?i’s
  Bodhi-sattva by laying his <span class="t20 hoverable">hands</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> him, so that by virtue of this
  benediction, he <span class="t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> forth the prayer ‘Om ma?i padme Hum.’
  Padma-pa?i then made a solemn vow to rescue all the <span class="t0 t1 t15 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> in hell
  from their pains, saying to himself:—‘If I fail, may my <span class="t1 t4 t9 t16 hoverable">head</span> split
  into a <span class="t6 hoverable">thousand</span> pieces!’ After remaining absorbed in contemplation for
  some time, he proceeded to the various hells, expecting to <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> that
  the inhabitants, through the efficacy of his meditations, had ascended
  to the <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> worlds. And this indeed he found they had done. But no
  sooner was their release accomplished than all the hells again became
  as <span class="t10 t16 hoverable">full</span> as ever, the places of the out-going tenants being supplied by
  an equal <span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span> of new-comers. This so astounded the unhappy
  Bodhi-sattva that his <span class="t1 t4 t9 t16 hoverable">head</span> instantly split into a <span class="t6 hoverable">thousand</span> pieces.
  Then Amitabha, deeply moved by his son’s misfortune, hastened to his
  assistance, and formed the <span class="t6 hoverable">thousand</span> pieces into ten heads.

Schlagintweit states, and I have myself observed, that Avalokite?vara’s
eleven heads are generally represented as forming a pyramid, and are
ranged in four rows. Each series of heads has a particular complexion.
The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> faces resting on the neck are white, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> above yellow,
the next <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> red, the tenth blue, and the eleventh—that is, the <span class="t1 t4 t9 t16 hoverable">head</span>
of his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">father</span> Amitabha at the top of all[258]—is red. In Japanese images
the heads are much smaller, and are arranged like a crown, the centre of
which is formed by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> entire figures, the lower one sitting, the other
standing above it. Ten small heads are combined with these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> figures.

The <span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span> of Avalokite?vara’s <span class="t20 hoverable">hands</span> ought to amount to a thousand, and
he is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> ‘a thousand-eyed,’ as having the eye of <span class="t7 t8 t12 hoverable">wisdom</span> on each
palm. Of course all these <span class="t6 hoverable">thousand</span> arms and <span class="t2 t6 t19 t20 t26 t29 hoverable">eyes</span> cannot be represented
in images. Still there is an idol in the British Museum which represents
him with about forty arms, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> of which have the <span class="t20 hoverable">hands</span> joined in an
attitude of worship.

A remarkable description of an image of Avalokite?vara seen by Sarat
Chandra Das (so recently as 1882) in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> temple at Lhassa occurs
in his ‘Narrative’ (which I here abridge):—

  Next to the image of Buddha, the most conspicuous figure was that of
  Chanrassig (i. e. the eleven-faced Avalokite?vara). The origin of this
  is ascribed to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span> Sron Tsan Gampo (p. 271 of this volume). Once the
  <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t18 hoverable">heard</span> a voice from heaven, saying that if he constructed an image
  of Avalokite?vara of the size of his own person, all his desires <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span>
  be fulfilled.

  Thereupon he proceeded to do so, and the materials he <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">used</span> were a
  branch of the sacred Bodhi-tree, a portion of the Vajrasana, some soil
  from an oceanic island, some sand from the river Nairañjana, some pith
  of Go?irsha sandal-wood, a portion of the soil of the eight sacred
  places of <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> India, and many other rare articles pounded <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span>
  and made into paste, with the milk of a red cow and a she-goat. This
  paste the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> touched with his head, and prayed to the all-knowing
  Buddhas and the host of Bodhi-sattvas, that by the merit of making
  that image, there might be god-speed to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> he had
  undertaken—namely, the diffusion of Buddhism in Tibet.

  The gods, Buddhas, saints, etc. filled the aerial space to listen to
  his prayer.

  The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> then ordered the Nepalese artist to hasten the completion of
  the image, and with a <span class="t25 hoverable">view</span> of heightening its sanctity, obtained a
  sandal-wood image of Avalokite?vara from Ceylon and inserted it
  inside, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> with the relics of the seven past Buddhas. When the
  <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> was finished, the artist said:—

  ‘Sire, I cannot say that I have made this image, it has passed into
  self-grown existence.’ Then a current of lightning flashed forth from
  its feet. Afterwards, the souls of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> and his queen are said to
  have been absorbed into it, in consequence of which this image is
  <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> ‘the five-absorbed self-sprung.’

It is recorded in another tradition that a wonder-working image of
Avalokite?vara was <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> up in a monastery near Kabul, and another in
Magadha near the Ganges. Any worshipper who approached these idols in
devotion and <span class="t7 t13 t19 t20 t29 hoverable">faith</span> were favoured with a personal vision of the saint.
The statues opened, and the Bodhi-sattva emerged in bright rays of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span>
(compare Koeppen, i. p. 499).

Originally, and still in Tibet, Avalokite?vara (otherwise <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span>
Padma-pa?i) had only male attributes; but in China this deity (as we
have already mentioned at p. 200) is represented as a woman, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span>
Kwan-yin (in Japan Kwan-non), with a <span class="t6 hoverable">thousand</span> arms and a <span class="t6 hoverable">thousand</span> eyes.
She has her principal seat in the island of Poo-too, on the coast of
China, which is a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> of pilgrimage.

There are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> images of Kwan-yin in the British Museum, one with sixteen
arms and the other with eight.

Images of the <span class="t26 hoverable">third</span> mythical Bodhi-sattva—the fierce Vajra-pa?i,
‘holding a thunderbolt in one hand’—like one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of ?iva—are almost as
common as those of the merciful and mild Avalokite?vara. He has been
described in a previous Lecture (p. 201).

In the Pitt-Rivers collection at Oxford there is an image of this
Bodhi-sattva engaged in combating the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of evil. It is remarkable
that the figures of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> monkeys are carved underneath, one stopping
his ears with his hands, another stopping his eyes, and another his
mouth, to symbolize the effort to prevent the entrance of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> desires
through the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> most important organs of sense.

With regard to the images of female deities we may observe that Tara,
the wife or ?akti of Amogha-siddha (p. 216), is represented as a green
sedent figure; her right <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> on her knee, her <span class="t1 t7 t12 t29 hoverable">left</span> holding a lotus.

A standing image of the goddess Pa??ini (p. 217 of this volume) may be
seen in the British Museum.

In a temple which I visited near Darjiling I saw the image of the
Padma-sambhava or ‘lotus-born’ <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> occupying the centre of
the altar, with the images of Gautama <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> and of <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> Ayushmat, or
the ‘Buddha of Life,’ on each side.

Sir R. Temple (Journal, p. 212) relates how in a chamber of a Sikkim
monastery there were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> figures, the central of which, with a fair
complexion, was Amitabha, that on its right Gautama Buddha, and on its
<span class="t1 t7 t12 t29 hoverable">left</span> Gorakh-nath (see p. 193 of this volume).

In the monastery of Galdan (p. 441) Mr. Sarat Chandra Das saw the golden
image of Tsong Khapa (with his golden chain and his tooth and his
block-prints), along with the images of Amitabha, Gautama, Maitreya,
Bhairava (the awful defender of Buddhism), Yama ‘the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">lord</span> of death,’ and
his terrific messengers.

In the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Cho Khang at Lhassa (see p. 459) he saw images of
Avalokite?vara, Mañju-sri, Maitreya, Kuvera, Padma-sambhava, with an
immense <span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span> of others, and especially one of the terrific goddess
Paldan (or Pandan) who is feared all over Tibet, Mongolia, and China, as
the greatest guardian deity of the Dalai and Tashi Lamas and of the
Buddhist Dharma. He found her shrine infested with mice, who are
believed to be metamorphosed monks.

At Sera (p. 442) he saw images of the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> in his character of
‘demon-vanquisher,’ along with Maitreya (in silver), Avalokite?vara, the
six-armed Bhairava, the goddess Kali, Dolkar (= Tara, p. 271), the
Tantrik Vajra-varahi, the sixteen Sthaviras (pp. 48, 255), and a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>
variety of others.

At Radeng (p. 273) he saw a golden image of Milaraspa (p. 384).

In the monastery of Sam ye (p. 448) he saw images of the Indian Pa??its
who <span class="t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> Buddhism into Tibet, with a vast <span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span> of other images.

At Tashi Lunpo he saw golden images of <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> and Maitreya, besides
images of 1000 other Buddhas (p. 189), and the four guardians of the
quarters (p. 206).

At Yarlung he saw an image of Vairocana Buddha, besides images of the
sixteen Sthaviras, and a gigantic image of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> of the Nagas, and a
terrific representation of the demon Rava?a (of the Ramaya?a).

At Mindolling he saw fresco paintings of the six classes of <span class="t0 t1 t15 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> (p.
122) inhabiting the six corresponding worlds. Of course delineations of
the Jatakas (p. 111) and pictures of all kinds were common in
monasteries and temples everywhere.

The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> wonder-working images <span class="t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> from Nepal and China have been
already mentioned (p. 271).

As an illustration of the monstrous superstition and idolatry prevalent
in modern Buddhist countries, I venture, in conclusion, to quote, with
abridgment, the following description of an idol seen by Miss Bird in
Japan (see her ‘Unbeaten Tracks in Japan,’ published by Mr. Murray):—

  In one shrine is a large idol spotted all over with pellets of paper,
  and hundreds of these may be seen sticking to the wire-netting which
  protects him. A worshipper writes his petition on paper, or, better
  still, has it <span class="t2 t11 t15 t19 t25 t27 hoverable">written</span> for him by the priest, chews it to a pulp and
  spits it at the divinity. If, having been <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> aimed, it passes
  through the wire and sticks, it is a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> omen, if it lodges in the
  netting the prayer has probably been unheard.

  On the <span class="t1 t7 t12 t29 hoverable">left</span> there is a shrine with a screen, to which innumerable
  prayers have been tied. On the right sits one of Buddha’s original
  sixteen disciples (see p. 47 of these Lectures). A Koolie with a
  swelled knee applied it to the knee of the idol, while one with
  inflamed eyelids rubbed his eyelids on it!




                             LECTURE XVII.
                           _Sacred Objects._


Next to the subject of images and idols comes that of certain sacred
objects which Buddhists of all Schools—whether adherents of the
Hina-yana or Maha-yana systems—hold in veneration; for example, relics,
relic-receptacles or Stupas, foot-prints, trees, utensils, bells,
symbols, and animals.

The narratives of the Chinese travellers, frequently mentioned before,
teem with descriptions of such objects. Take, for instance, Fa-hien’s
<span class="t1 t11 t12 t13 t16 t18 t21 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the district of Nagara, near Peshawar in Northern India
(Legge, 34-40), in which several sacred objects are stated to exist—such
as a fragment of Buddha’s skull, one of his teeth, portions of his hair
and nails, his alms-bowl, his staff (contained in a wooden tube, so
heavy that even a <span class="t6 hoverable">thousand</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> could not lift it), his robe, and the
impression of his shadow. This was at the beginning of the fifth century
of our era.

Fa-hien’s statements are confirmed by Sung-Yun, the next Chinese
traveller mentioned before (p. 161 of this volume[259]), who started on
his journey rather more than a century after Fa-hien.

  We then visited the Ki-Ka-lam temple near Nagara. This contains the
  yellow robe (Kashaya) of <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> in thirteen pieces. Here also is the
  staff of Buddha, in a wooden <span class="t5 t16 t21 t24 t25 hoverable">case</span> covered with gold-leaf. The weight
  of this staff is sometimes so heavy that a hundred <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> cannot raise
  it, and at other times it is so <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> that one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> can lift it. In the
  <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">city</span> of Na-kie (Nagarahara) is a tooth of <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> and also some of his
  hair, both of which are contained in precious caskets. Morning and
  evening religious offerings are made to them.

  We next arrive at the cave of Go-pala, where is the shadow of Buddha.
  To anyone entering the cavern, and looking for a <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> (or, from a
  <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> distance) at the western side of it opposite the door, the
  figure, with its characteristic marks, appears; on going nearer, it
  gradually grows fainter and then disappears. On touching the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span>
  where it was, there is nothing but the bare wall. Gradually
  retreating, the figure begins to come in <span class="t25 hoverable">view</span> again, and foremost is
  conspicuous that peculiar mark between the eyebrows (ur?a), which is
  so rare among men.

  Before the cave is a square stone, on which is a trace of Buddha’s
  foot (Beal’s Translation, p. cvii, abridged).

Hiouen Thsang, the <span class="t26 hoverable">third</span> traveller, confirms the statements of his
predecessors in regard to the relics in this district, and adds as
follows:—

  There is another little Stupa, made of the seven precious substances,
  in which is deposited the _eye-ball_ of the Buddha, large as an Amra
  fruit, and bright and clear throughout. It is deposited in a sealed-up
  casket (Beal, i. 96).

It is easy to perceive from the above extracts that the <span class="t0 t5 t11 hoverable">worship</span> of
certain sacred objects connected with the founder of Buddhism had become
even in Fa-hien’s <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> a marked feature of Buddhism. In fact, the <span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span>
of such objects increased so rapidly that before <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> it became usual to
classify them under <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> heads as follow[260]:—

(1) ?aririka (or ?arira-dhatu or simply ?arira), objects which once
formed part of the Buddha’s body, such as a bone, a tooth, a hair, a
nail.

(2) Paribhogika, ‘objects possessed or <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">used</span> by the Buddha,’ such as his
seat, alms-bowl, drinking-vessel (kumbha), staff, vestments, and even
his spittoon. Under this division is placed the Bodhi-tree.

(3) Udde?ika, objects worshipped as in some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> commemorative of the
<span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> or of some event or incident in his life.

It <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be difficult to decide under which of these categories the
_sacred books_ containing the Buddha’s <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Law</span> are to be placed, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span>
they are deeply revered, and at the present <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> almost deified, as if
they were intelligent and omniscient beings. They are wrapped in costly
cloth or silk, and their names are mentioned with the addition of
honorific personal titles. Occasionally such sacred books are placed on
a <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of rude altar, near the road-side, that passers-by may <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span>
offerings of money <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> them[261].

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Without</span> attempting, therefore, to follow any particular classification,
we proceed to notice some of the chief objects in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">order</span> of their
importance, beginning with relics.


                               _Relics._

Adoration of relics constitutes an important point of difference between
Buddhism and Brahmanism; for Brahmanism and its offspring Hinduism are
wholly opposed to the practice of preserving the ashes, bones, hair, or
teeth of deceased persons, however much such individuals may have been
revered during life.

I remarked in the course of my travels through India that articles <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">used</span>
by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> religious teachers—as, for example, robes, wooden shoes, and
seats—are sometimes preserved and venerated after their death. All
articles of this kind, however, must, of course, be removed from the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> before actual decease; for it is <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> known that, in the minds of
Hindus, ideas of impurity are inseparably connected with death, and
contamination is supposed to result from contact with the corpses of
even a man’s dearest relatives. Nor is the mortal frame ever held in
veneration by the Hindus as it was by the <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> Egyptians, and as it
generally is in Christian countries.

Even the living <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> is regarded as a mass of corruption, a <span class="t3 t5 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">thing</span> to be
held in contempt, and a constant impediment to sanctity of life. How
much more then ought every part of a dead <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> to be got rid of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span>
delay! Hence in the present <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> a corpse is burnt, and its ashes are
generally scattered on the surface of sacred rivers or of the sea.

It is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> that the bodies of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Hindu ascetics and devotees are
exempted from this rule. They are usually buried—not burnt. Not,
however, because the mere corporeal frame is held in greater veneration,
but because the bodies of the most eminent saints are supposed to lie
undecomposed in a <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of trance, or <span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> of intense ecstatic
meditation (samadhi).

The Buddhist, too, is a thorough Hindu in contemning the living body;
but when the corpse is burnt, he does not scatter the ashes on rivers.
He takes measures to preserve them.

We know that according to the teaching of Brahmanism the burning of a
corpse is followed by religious ceremonies <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> ?raddhas[262]. The
greater the <span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span> of ?raddhas which a living <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> is able to perform in
behalf of his deceased relatives, the greater is the benefit which

The calcined ashes, or certain unconsumed portions of the body—such as
fragments of bone or hair or nails or teeth—are deposited in
relic-shrines.

Of course the most sacred of all Buddhist relics are those of the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span>
himself. It is said that after the cremation of his corpse the chief
remains consisted of four teeth, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> cheek-bones, and fragments of
the skull. But it is believed that, even before his death, portions of
his hair and nails were preserved and placed under Dagabas (Stupas). One
legend relates that when Gautama had decided on abandoning all worldly
associations, his first act was to cut off the mass of his hair, with
its ornament (cu?a-ma?i), and that these were <span class="t2 t5 t11 t18 t19 t23 t26 hoverable">taken</span> up by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">god</span> Indra
to the Trayastri??a heaven, and there placed under a Dagaba and
worshipped by the gods.

Fa-hien, in a <span class="t28 hoverable">passage</span> already alluded to, says that in the country of
Nagara there is a particular spot where <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> shaved off his hair and
clipt his nails, and, having done so, proceeded to erect a lofty mound
or Stupa to enshrine them, as <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as to be a model for all future
Stupas (p. 504 of this volume).

Hiouen Thsang relates a tradition that when the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> travelling merchants
Trapusha and Bhallika (see p. 40) were converted, the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> gave them
at their own request some of his own hair and nail-parings, besides his
alms-bowl, staff, and a portion of his clothing, and bade them deposit
each article in Stupas or Dagabas. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> merchants, it is narrated,
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> home to their own country and acquired an enormous stock of
religious merit by being the first to erect a Stupa for the reception of
personal memorials of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Buddha. According to a tradition the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span>
merchants were from Burma, and the shrine which was erected to receive
eight of his hairs afterwards developed into the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Rangoon Dagaba
(Pagoda). It may be inferred from this legend (as Dr. Oldenberg has
already remarked) that the care of the Buddha’s relics, and the
institution of ceremonies in their honour, were in the first instance
<span class="t1 t7 t12 t29 hoverable">left</span> to the devotion of religiously minded Buddhist laymen.

  ‘What are we to do,’ Ananda asks of the Master, when his end is
  drawing near[263], ‘with the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> of the Perfect One?’ ‘Let not the

  ye rather perfection for yourselves. There are, Ananda, <span class="t5 t8 hoverable">wise</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> among
  the nobles, the Brahmans, and the citizens, who believe in the Perfect
  One; they will honour the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> of the Perfect One.’

Hiouen Thsang (Beal, ii. 40) also states that when certain Indian Rajas,
eight in number, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t18 hoverable">heard</span> of the Buddha’s death, they collected armies and
marched to Kusi-nara (p. 424) to seize portions of the relics; but the
prince of Kusi-nara refused to give them up. In the end the matter was
settled amicably, and the relics were divided, so that each of the eight
princes might <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> a share. Then all departed to their own homes, and
each prince built a Stupa over his own portion of the relics. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span>
also <span class="t2 t4 t6 t9 t18 t19 t22 hoverable">took</span> their portions.

Fa-hien (chap. xxiii) alludes to the building of the eight Stupas, and
adds that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> A?oka destroyed them, and in their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> built 84,000
others—one for the conservation of each atom of the elements of the
Buddha’s body; the belief being that the bodies of all <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t0 t1 t15 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span>
consist of that <span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span> of elementary particles (see p. 423). The
eight-fold division is described in ‘Buddhist Suttas,’ pp. 133-136 (S.
B. E. vol. xi).

It appears probable that the earliest relics of his burnt <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> held in
honour were his teeth; and of these again the most celebrated seem to
have been his four eye-teeth. One of the four is said to have been
appropriated by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> and another by the Nagas, while the <span class="t26 hoverable">third</span> was
<span class="t2 t5 t11 t18 t19 t23 t26 hoverable">taken</span> to Gandhara in the north-west, and the fourth to Kali?ga in the
south-east.

The first <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> eye-teeth have only mythical histories, and little is
recorded of the third, but the fourth has gone through a series of
terrestrial adventures, which have been much <span class="t2 t11 t15 t19 t25 t27 hoverable">written</span> about and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span>
fill several volumes. One of the immediate followers of Gautama is said
to have gained possession of it on the occasion of the eight-fold
distribution of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> sage’s relics (p. 499), and to have conveyed
it to a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> afterwards <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Danta-pura, ‘tooth-city[264],’ the
capital of Kali?ga (Orissa), where it is believed to have remained
undisturbed for about 800 years. After that period it was seized, at the
instigation of some Brahmans, by a powerful Hindu <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> who reigned at
Pa?aliputra. Its vicissitudes and adventures for centuries afterwards
were very varied. It was conveyed surreptitiously to Ceylon about the
year 311 of our era by a princess of Kali?ga, who concealed it in her
hair. There it remained till 1315, when it was carried back to Southern
India. After a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> it was <span class="t2 t5 t11 t18 t19 t23 t26 hoverable">taken</span> back to Kandy in Ceylon. Next it was
seized by the Portuguese and carried off to Goa. Thence it was
transported to Pegu, and finally the precious tooth-relic (da?ha-dhatu),
or at least some imitation of it, was restored to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> of
Kandy, where it is still preserved by them as a veritable Palladium,
with every possible precaution against further outrage, although under
the protecting ægis of our government its security ought not any longer
to be matter of anxiety.

Every native of Ceylon (La?ka), <span class="t0 t5 t8 t10 t14 t15 t21 t24 t28 hoverable">whether</span> Buddhist or Hindu, seems to feel
that the welfare of his country depends on its careful conservation. At
any rate the Sinhalese have placed their tooth-temple—called Dalada
Maligawa—in the loveliest part of their beautiful island (see p. 454),
amid richly wooded hills, from which may be obtained some of the most
enchanting views in the world. The eye-tooth is in appearance like a
piece of discoloured ivory about <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> inches[265] long, and one inch
across in the thickest part. Indeed, all the supposed relics of the
Buddha’s body, and the dress and implements he used, are of such a size
as to make his worshippers believe that his stature far exceeded that of
ordinary men.

The tooth is enclosed in nine bell-shaped, jewelled golden cases, one
<span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">within</span> the other, each locked by a key, and each key consigned to the
custody of a separate official. The interior cases increase in
costliness till the most highly jewelled of all is reached, and <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">within</span>
this on a golden lotus lies the relic. When I visited the tooth-temple
in 1877, the cases were kept <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">within</span> iron bars in a dimly-lighted
shrine—redolent with flower-offerings which exhaled an overpowering
perfume—and in the very centre of the buildings of the temple. When the
Prince of Wales visited Kandy in 1876, all the officials assembled to
unlock the cases and exhibit the treasured relic.

A detailed <span class="t1 t11 t12 t13 t16 t18 t21 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the tooth is given in a <span class="t6 t8 t10 t11 t16 t20 t21 t27 t28 hoverable">book</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Dalada-va??a
or Da?ha-va??a, said to have been <span class="t2 t11 t15 t19 t25 t27 hoverable">written</span> originally in <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span>
Sinhalese (Elu) about the year 310 of our era, and translated into the
sacred Pali about the year 1200. This <span class="t6 t8 t10 t11 t16 t20 t21 t27 t28 hoverable">book</span> has been rendered into
English by the late Sir Coomara Swamy. The tooth is also described in
many other Pali and Sinhalese books, including the Maha-va??a.

And here it may be remarked that one feature of the Buddha’s relics was
that they gave forth on special occasions celestial light, and had the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of working miracles. Sometimes a reverent circumambulation of the
shrine which contained the relics was believed to be sufficiently
efficacious in stimulating their miraculous powers. Sometimes they were
<span class="t2 t5 t11 t18 t19 t23 t26 hoverable">taken</span> out and exhibited. The following extract from Fa-hien reminds one
of what takes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> at Kandy in the present day:—

  In the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">city</span> of He-lo (the present Hi??a, west of Peshawar) there is
  the flat-bone of Buddha’s skull, deposited in a Vihara adorned all
  over with gold-leaf and the seven sacred substances. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> of the
  country revering the bone, and anxious lest it should be stolen, has
  selected eight individuals representing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> families, and committed
  to each a seal with which he should seal the shrine and guard the
  relic. At early dawn these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> come, and after each has inspected his
  seal, they open the door. This done they wash their <span class="t20 hoverable">hands</span> with scented
  water, and <span class="t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t27 t29 hoverable">bring</span> out the bone, which they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> on a lofty platform,
  where it is supported on a pedestal of the seven precious substances.
  The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> every morning makes his offerings and performs his worship.
  The chiefs of the Vai?yas also make their offerings. Then they replace
  the bone in the Vihara, under a Stupa of the seven precious substances
  (p. 528 of this volume) more than five cubits <span class="t17 t29 hoverable">high</span> (Legge, pp. 36-38,
  abridged).

Fa-hien records a similar exhibition of the Buddha’s alms-bowl in the
country near Peshawar:—

  When it is mid-day they <span class="t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t27 t29 hoverable">bring</span> out the bowl and make offerings to it.
  It may contain about <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> pecks, and it has a bright lustre. When poor
  <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> throw into it a few flowers, it becomes full. If the rich throw
  in myriads of flowers, they are not able to fill it.

He states that the Buddha’s robe was also <span class="t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> out to be worshipped:—

  When there is a drought the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> collect in crowds, <span class="t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t27 t29 hoverable">bring</span> out the
  robe, pay <span class="t0 t5 t11 hoverable">worship</span> to it and make offerings, on which there is
  immediately a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> rain from the sky (Legge, pp. 35, 39, abridged).

The relics of all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> saints in Buddhist countries were revered in a
similar manner. At the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> it ought to be noted that the
periodical exhibition of relics, before the <span class="t2 t6 t19 t20 t26 t29 hoverable">eyes</span> of worshippers, was not
a usual occurrence (as it is in Roman Catholic countries). Indeed, as a
general rule, the custom seems to have been to shield the ashes and
remains of revered dead bodies from observation and liability to be
touched. Hence they were commonly sealed up hermetically, as it were, in
the interior of receptacles which effectually concealed them from <span class="t25 hoverable">view</span>
and protected them from disturbance.

And this leads us to advert to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> and character of Buddhist
relic-receptacles.

It is probable that at a very early period, and even before the Buddha’s
time, the Hindus were accustomed to raise heaps or tumuli over the ashes
of kings, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> men, saints and sages, just as even to this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> among
the Sikhs of the Panjab, the ashes of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> are so honoured. Some
think that the hemispherical dome-like <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of the tumulus was intended
to represent a bubble—the most transitory of all material objects. In
all likelihood the dome of the Sañchi Stupa—which is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> to be as
old as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of Buddha—was constructed in memory of some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> man.

Such heaps were at first generally <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Caityas, and afterwards Stupas
(from the Sansk?it roots ci and styai, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> ‘to heap together’); but
Caitya ultimately denoted a relic-structure in an assembly-hall (see p.
450), while the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> Stupa denoted one in the open air. Then inside the
Caitya or Stupa (Pali Thupa, corrupted into Tope) there was a
casket—made of silver, gold, stone, earthenware, etc.—in which were
deposited the ashes, fragments of bone, or the teeth or nails of the
deceased. And this relic-casket was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> in Sansk?it Dhatu-garbha, or
in Pali Dagaba (corrupted into Dagoba and afterwards into Pagoda)—that
is, a repository of the elementary particles of which all bodies are
composed.

Then in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> Dagaba (Pagoda) denoted the monument as <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as
the relic-casket. Moreover Caityas and Stupas were often mere pyramidal
structures, enshrining images or marking important events (see p. 390),
but not containing relics. Among the Hindus Caitya often denotes the
sacred village-tree planted on a mound.

[Illustration: VOTIVE STUPA, RECENTLY FOUND AT BUDDHA-GAYA.]

            (Date about ninth or tenth century of our era.)

The process by which the simple Caitya or mound developed into more
elaborate structures is remarkable. First came erections of stone or
brick, generally bell-shaped or domed like bee-hives. These again
expanded into elongated pyramidal structures, springing from cylindrical
or octagonal or hexagonal bases, and ornamented with images of Gautama,
and resting on plinth-like foundations, the summits tapering into
finials consisting of three, or seven, or nine, or eleven, or even
fifteen tiers of umbrella-shaped ornaments (see note, p. 393).

Then, again, in time, these elaborate Dagabas expanded into vast Pagodas
of enormous height, as, for example, the Rangoon Pagoda (see p. 456) and
that at Anuradha-pura in Ceylon.

It is doubtful <span class="t0 t5 t8 t10 t14 t15 t21 t24 t28 hoverable">whether</span> in early Buddhism Caityas and Stupas were ever
empty monuments or cenotaphs. Probably all of them contained ashes,
fragments of bone, teeth, or hair, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> in some cases the most careful
examination has failed to discover the vessel in which they were
deposited. If made of fragile materials, it rapidly crumbled into dust.
But Stupas, even <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> relics, were themselves objects of reverence.

In the later period of Buddhism the practice of carving, or moulding
mere memorial or votive Stupas, and dedicating them at sacred spots
became common. The examples of this <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of Stupa which I saw unearthed
at Buddha-Gaya have been described (p. 397).

The engraving opposite to this page is a copy of one of these votive
Stupas which I procured for the Indian Institute through Mr. Beglar.

At Mandalay there is a large Pagoda with about 620 smaller ones round it
(in rows of six or seven deep). Each small Pagoda enshrines a
tablet—exposed to view—on which some portion of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Law</span> is engraved.
Many small Pagodas are simply canopies of brick or some solid material
erected over images.

Outside the Buddhist convent near Darjiling, when I visited it in 1884,
a monk was roughly moulding a <span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span> of small votive Stupas in clay,
with which he was probably mixing the powdered bones of some deceased
Lama. Here is a copy of one exactly the size of the original:—

[Illustration: ]

If broken open, a terra-cotta seal, inscribed with some sacred formula,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> probably be found inside.

Of course most of the Buddha’s chief disciples, such as Sariputta,
Maudgalyayana, Ka?yapa, Ananda, Upali, each had Stupas erected over
their relics.


                         _Sacred Foot-prints._

Next in importance to the <span class="t0 t5 t11 hoverable">worship</span> of relics is that of foot-prints
(Sansk?it ?ri-pada or ?ri-pada). Everywhere throughout Buddhist
countries the supposed impressions of the Buddha’s feet are as much
honoured as those of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">god</span> Vish?u are by Vaish?avas.

When Fa-hien reached G?idhra-ku?a (see pp. 404, 406), he is said to have
<span class="t0 t12 hoverable">used</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> to the following effect: ‘I, Fa-hien, was <span class="t9 t24 hoverable">born</span> when I could
not meet with Buddha, and now I only see the foot-prints which he has
left’ (Legge, 83).

It is <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> known that the practice of bowing down and honouring the feet
is a thoroughly Asiatic custom. The <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> seems to be derived from a <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span>
of _a fortiori_ argument. If the feet, as the lowest member of the body,
are honoured, how much more is homage rendered to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> man. Hence
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">children</span> honour their parents, not by kissing their faces, but by
prostrating themselves at their feet and touching them reverentially.
Another <span class="t1 t11 t16 t20 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">reason</span> for venerating the feet is <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> expressed in one of our
hymns:—

  O let me see <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thy</span> foot-marks,
  And in them plant my own;

and in Longfellow’s

    Foot-prints on the sands of time;
  Foot-prints which perhaps another,
    Sailing o’er life’s solemn main,
  A forlorn and shipwrecked brother,
    Seeing may <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> again.

This shows that even Europeans are familiar with the idea. There is a
Roman Catholic church at Vienna which possesses a celebrated image of
<span class="t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t13 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">Christ</span> on the Cross. On one occasion I visited this church and observed
several worshippers kissing the feet of the image, while others—too
short in stature to reach it with their lips—touched its feet with their
fingers and then kissed their fingers. A similar honour is paid to the
images of St. Peter at Rome, and indeed to that Apostle’s living
representatives. The alleged foot-prints of <span class="t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t13 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">Christ</span> are not numerous, but
they exist in certain <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">holy</span> places[266].

Every sentiment in the East is exaggerated, and it need not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> be
matter of wonder if a veneration for foot-prints has led to an excessive
multiplication of these symbols, and to an excess of superstitious
<span class="t0 t5 t11 hoverable">worship</span> paid to them by Hindus of various sects in every part of India.
No <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> Vaish?ava will leave his <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> in the morning <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> marking
his forehead with the symbol of Vish?u’s feet. In travelling from one
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> to another I often came across what appeared to be an empty
shrine, but on a close inspection I found that it contained <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span>
foot-prints on a little raised altar made of stone. These are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span>
Paduka ‘shoes,’ but are really the supposed impressions of the soles of
the feet of the <span class="t0 t4 t5 t10 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">person</span> to whom the shrines are dedicated. In 1876 I
visited the celebrated Vish?u-pad temple at Gaya. Crowds were
worshipping the foot-mark impressed on the bare stone, but concealed by
offerings, and surrounded by a silver fence under a silver canopy (see
‘Brahmanism and Hinduism,’ p. 309).

It is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> that Buddhists never imitate the practice of the worshippers
of Vish?u by marking their foreheads with the supposed impressions of
the Buddha’s feet, but they will nevertheless make <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> and toilsome
pilgrimages to bow down before what they believe to be the impression of
his foot on a rock.

The Jainas, who are the only Hindu representatives of the Buddhistic
system <span class="t1 t7 t12 t29 hoverable">left</span> in India, are quite as ardent foot-print worshippers. In
1884 I ascended Mount Parasnath (Par?va-nath) in Bengal at the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span>
with crowds of Jaina pilgrims who, like myself, toiled up the hill to
visit the numerous Jaina temples scattered over the uneven surface at
the summit, some five <span class="t6 hoverable">thousand</span> feet above the plain. Our objects were
very different. Theirs was the acquisition of merit, <span class="t6 hoverable">mine</span> was the
acquirement of knowledge. Lepers lined the rough pathway, and much
additional merit was held to accrue to the pilgrims by distributing alms
among them. I found that nearly every shrine at the summit consisted of
a little domed canopy of marble, covering <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> foot-prints of some one of
the twenty-four Jaina saints (especially Par?va-nath) impressed on a
marble altar. The soles of the supposed foot-prints were either white or
black and marked with small gilded circles.

Groups of worshippers bowed down before the shrines and deposited
offerings of money, rice, almonds, raisins, and spices on the
foot-marks. No sooner did they quit one shrine for the next, than a
troop of frolicking monkeys promptly <span class="t2 t4 t6 t9 t18 t19 t22 hoverable">took</span> their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> and scampered off
with the edible portion of the objects offered.

It is impossible to <span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> positively when either Buddhism or Jainism
first introduced foot-print worship, but the practice must have begun
very early.

With regard to this point General Sir A. Cunningham, in his <span class="t1 t11 t12 t13 t16 t18 t21 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of
the Bharhut Stupa—a Stupa which dates from the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t13 t14 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">second</span> century
B.C.—says:—

  Foot-prints of <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> were most probably an <span class="t24 t25 hoverable">object</span> of reverence from a
  very early period—certainly before the building of the Bharhut
  Stupa—as they are represented in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> separate sculptures there. In the
  first sculpture the foot-prints are placed on a throne or altar,
  canopied by an umbrella, hung with garlands. A royal personage is
  kneeling before the altar, and reverently touching the foot-prints
  with his hands. The <span class="t0 t2 t5 t13 t14 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">second</span> example is in the bas-relief representing
  the visit of Ajata-?atru to Buddha. Here, as in all other Bharhut
  sculptures, <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> does not appear in person, his presence being
  marked by his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> foot-prints. The wheel symbol is duly marked on both
  (p. 112, abridged).

The General justly remarks that perhaps the <span class="t0 t5 t11 hoverable">worship</span> of the Buddha’s
foot-prints may have sprung up in imitation of the homage alleged to
have been paid by Maha-Ka?yapa and 500 monks to his feet, which, it is
said, were exposed to <span class="t25 hoverable">view</span> when his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> was lying on the funeral pile.
The legend states that while the monks were in the act of bowing down in
adoration before the feet, the funeral pile ignited spontaneously.

On one of the gate-pillars of the <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> Sañchi Stupa there is a
sculpture of a foot-print marked with the wheel (Cakra, p. 522) symbol,
which the late Mr. Fergusson ascribed to the early part of the first
century of the Christian era.

There are also sculptured representations of the Buddha’s foot-prints at
Amaravati, supposed to date from the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t13 t14 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">second</span> or <span class="t26 hoverable">third</span> century of the
Christian era. These representations are often carved on so-called
altars or else placed before altars.

But of all foot-prints, that on Adam’s Peak (the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t22 t23 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">highest</span> mountain in
Ceylon, more than 7000 feet above the sea), supposed to have been <span class="t1 t7 t12 t29 hoverable">left</span>
by the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> when he ascended thence to heaven, is the most celebrated.

According to Fa-hien (Legge, p. 102), when <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> was in Ceylon he
planted one foot on the north of the royal <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">city</span> and the other on
Sumana-Ku?a (Adam’s Peak), fifteen yojanas, or about a hundred miles,
distant.

This fancied impression of the Buddha’s foot (believed by Christians to
be that of St. Thomas, by Muhammadans to be that of Adam, and by Hindus
to be that of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">god</span> ?iva) is merely a shapeless hollow in the rock,
five feet seven inches <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> feet seven inches broad, which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span>
give the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> a stature of about thirty-five feet. It is said to have
been discovered by a hunter at the beginning of the century before
Christ, and, although very difficult of access, is annually visited by
about 100,000 Buddhist pilgrims. Near it, on the summit of the mountain,
is a small temple dedicated to Saman (p. 217).

In a shrine near the tooth-temple at Kandy, I saw a so-called facsimile
of this foot-print. Those who are physically incapable of toiling up the
mountain to bow down before the sacred impression on the rock, gain
nearly as much merit by worshipping its copy. The shrine was filled with
fragrant flowers recently deposited on the facsimile.

Other foot-prints in various places throughout India, Burma, Siam,
Tibet, Mongolia, and China, are from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> to five feet long. A tradition
is mentioned by Fa-hien (Legge, 29) that, when <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> visited Northern
India, he came to the country of Woo-chang or Udyana, and there he <span class="t1 t7 t12 t29 hoverable">left</span>
a print of his foot, which appears <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> or short according to the ideas
of the beholders.

Another legend states that <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> <span class="t1 t7 t12 t29 hoverable">left</span> the print of his <span class="t1 t7 t12 t29 hoverable">left</span> foot on
Adam’s Peak, and then, in one stride, strode across to Siam, where he
<span class="t1 t7 t12 t29 hoverable">left</span> the impression of his right foot.

The Siamese hold their foot-print in as much reverence as the Sinhalese
hold theirs. It is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Phra Bat, and, according to Mr. Alabaster, its
appearance is like that of the foot-print on Adam’s Peak. Nothing is to
be seen but a hole in the rock, about five feet <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> broad. A
temple is built over it, and every precaution <span class="t2 t5 t11 t18 t19 t23 t26 hoverable">taken</span> to protect it from
over-zealous worshippers. Mr. Alabaster <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> describes his visit to this
sacred spot:—

  The grating which usually covers the foot-print was removed to enable
  us to see the bottom, but the temple was so dark that we could not see
  much of it. We moved aside some of the offerings lying on it, but
  could see nothing of the pattern except the five marks of the
  toe-nails—five grooves in the rock—which some declare to have been
  made with chisels. On inquiry we were told that the other marks were
  <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> ago destroyed by an accidental fire. Likeness to a foot there is
  none. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> to this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">holy</span> foot-print year after year crowds of Siamese
  flock with varied offerings, and even the most enlightened amongst
  them—the late <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span> for instance—have observed and encouraged the
  practice. (‘Wheel of the Law,’ p. 284, abridged.)

The soles of the Buddha’s feet are represented as quite flat, and all
the toes of equal length. Each sole possesses, as we have seen (p. 20),
one hundred and eight auspicious marks (ma?gala-lakkha?a), and of these
the principal is generally the wheel (Cakra), while around it are
grouped representations of animals, inhabitants of various worlds, and
symbols of different kinds. In all probability the <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> is that all
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> are subject to the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> or belong to him; they are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span>
metaphorically placed under his feet. (Compare the metaphor in Psalm
viii. 6-8.)

The one hundred and eight marks vary in various specimens. A <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span>
typical example (brought from Burma) of the impression of one foot may
be seen in the British Museum. The sole is divided into compartments,
each compartment containing a mark. There are five conch-shells, one in
each of the five toes, this symbol being highly esteemed by Buddhists as

Among the one hundred and eight auspicious marks on the Siamese
foot-print are the following:—A spear, trident (tri-ratna), book,
elephant-goad, Indra’s elephant, dragon (makara), ocean, golden ship,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> with lotuses, conch-shell, four-faced Brahma, umbrella, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> of
Nagas, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> of horses, of tigers, of birds, sun, moon, ten mountains,
peacock, flag of victory, deer, fish, water-jar. The wheel (Cakra) does
not occur in Mr. Alabaster’s list (‘Wheel of the Law,’ p. 290), but the

wheel in the centre of the soles. Above is the Tri-ratna emblem with a
Svastika symbol on each side. There are other Svastika marks, and others
on the toes (see p. 523).

The Skanda-Pura?a and Bhagavata-Pura?a give similar lists of marks on
the sole of Vish?u’s foot.


                            _Sacred Trees._

We now <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t11 t12 t19 t22 hoverable">pass</span> on to a brief consideration of sacred trees. Most persons
are aware that the homage offered to trees and plants is not confined to
Buddhism. It existed very early in Brahmanism and is still common
everywhere throughout India (see my ‘Brahmanism and Hinduism,’ p. 330).

In point of <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> various forms of tree-worship prevail at the present
moment in almost every part of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> where superstition and
ignorance are ruling influences. Nor can we really condemn, as either
unnatural or unreasonable, the feeling of veneration with which trees
are generally regarded, bearing in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> the grateful shade and shelter
which they afford, the beauty of their foliage, their importance as
purifiers of the atmosphere, and the hundreds of useful purposes to
which their wood, leaves, and fruit are applicable. According to Dr. E.
B. Tylor (‘Primitive Culture,’ ii. 223), the North American Indians of
the Far West often hang offerings on the trees to propitiate the spirits
and procure <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> weather and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> hunting. He adds that Mr. Darwin
describes the South Americans as doing much the same.

In Persia and other Eastern Countries trees may often be met with, the
branches of which have been recently hung with offerings of cloth, rags,
and even garments.

In India the notion of trees being inhabited by deities or semi-divine
<span class="t0 t1 t15 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> or spirits is to this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> very common, and we have already noted
(p. 112) that during the period of Gautama’s Bodhi-sattvaship, in the
course of which he had to undergo countless births in preparation for
his Buddhahood, he was <span class="t9 t24 hoverable">born</span> forty-three times as a tree-god.

In Siam, according to Mr. Alabaster, offerings are commonly made in the
present <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> to the spirits or deities inhabiting trees. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">People</span> hang
various votive objects on the branches, or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> them on a stand or
altar beneath any particular tree <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> deity they wish to propitiate.
Moreover they are very averse to the cutting down of any trees of any
kind, lest the tree-gods should be angry.

  ‘Some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> ago,’ says Mr. Alabaster, ‘when I employed my spare energy
  in showing the Siamese how to make roads in the, till then, roadless
  suburbs of Bangkok, I had to cut my lines through villages,
  temple-groves, orchards, plantations, and patches of jungle. For the
  “wicked” duty of cutting down the trees, a gang of the lowest
  criminals was placed at my disposal.’ But he adds that the removal of
  any specially <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">holy</span> building or tree was interdicted by the Government.

We have already seen that, according to the theory of later Buddhism,
every <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> is supposed to have his own special tree under which he sat
and meditated, and in the end attained supreme <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> (see p. 136).
For example, there is the Pippala (also <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> A?vattha, _Ficus
Religiosa_) sacred fig-tree of Gautama Buddha, the Va?a or Banyan-tree
(_Ficus Indica_) of Ka?yapa Buddha, the U?umbara (_Ficus Glomerata_) of
Kanaka-muni; the ?irisha (_Acacia Serisa_) of Kraku-Cchanda; the ?ala
(_Shorea Robusta_) of Vi?va-bhu; the Pu??arika (_White_ _Lotus_) of
?ikhin[267]; the Pa?ali (_Bignonia Suaveolens_) of Vipa?yin.

These six Buddhas with Gautama are sometimes held to be the seven
principal Buddhas, and, according to some authorities, the tree of the
future <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> (Maitreya) will be the Iron-wood tree (Sideroxylon)[268].
Specimens of some of these trees are to be found growing in the area of
the Buddha-Gaya temple, and several are represented in the sculptures of
the Stupa of Bharhut (of the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t13 t14 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">second</span> century B.C.). On one of the pillars
of that Stupa elephants are carved in the act of worshipping both the
Pipal-tree and the Banyan-tree. In <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> it must be borne in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> that
Gautama <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> is said to have meditated under both of these trees, and
is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> connected with both (see p. 39).

It might have been expected, too, that the ?al-tree <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have ranked
next in sacredness to the Pipal and Banyan; for according to one legend,
Maya gave birth to Gautama while standing under a ?al-tree, and
according to another legend, Gautama died on a couch placed between <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span>
?al-trees (pp. 23, 50). This tree, however, appears to be more honoured
in connexion with the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> Vi?va-bhu (p. 136, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">note</span> 1).

There are other trees which were held in veneration by Indian
Buddhists:—for example, the Mango (Amra) and the Jambu, and the A?oka.
The first of these appears frequently in sculptures, and is known by the
shape of its fruit.

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Two</span> other trees under which the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> is said to have meditated after
his attainment of Buddhahood—namely, the Mucalinda-tree[269] and the
Rajayatana-tree—are not identified.

But among all trees revered by all Buddhists of all nationalities, the
A?vattha or Pippala (Pipal), under which Gautama achieved Buddhahood and
perfect knowledge, takes the precedence. In some Buddhist countries the
climate prevents its introduction, but if it can by any means be made to
grow, it is everywhere planted close to Buddhist temples, monasteries
and Dagabas, and in many cases is the product of a seed <span class="t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> from the
supposed original tree at Buddha-Gaya.

A tradition relates that Gautama during his lifetime directed Ananda to
break off a branch from that original tree and to plant it in the garden
of the Vihara, or monastery, at ?ravasti—Gautama’s favourite <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> of
residence—‘He who worships it,’ said Gautama, ‘will receive the same
reward as if he worshipped me[270].’

This is a mere legend resting on no historical basis; but the tradition
which makes Gautama choose a seat under the sacred Pippala or A?vattha
as the spot where the first stirrings of a <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> afflatus and the first
whisperings of <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> communications—symbolized by the mysterious
quivering and rustling of its leaves—were likely to make themselves
felt, points to a probable fact—a <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> quite in harmony with what we
have already noted in regard to his early Brahmanical education and
ideas. We read in the Ka?ha Upanishad (VI. 1) that the root of the
A?vattha-tree was identified with the Supreme Being, Brahman. In a
<span class="t28 hoverable">passage</span> of the Mu??aka Upanishad (III. 1. 1) and in a Mantra of the
?ig-veda (I. 164. 20) the same <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> is alluded to. It is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> that
Gautama afterwards repudiated the possibility of any <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> inspiration
coming from any external source whatever, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> it is probable that when
he first seated himself under the sacred fig-tree, which is even now
regarded by the Hindus as a manifestation of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">god</span> Brahma, he expected
supernatural communications of some kind[271].

The history of the original sacred Pippala (A?vattha) tree, or as it is
commonly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the Bodhi-tree (Bo-tree) of Gautama <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> at
Buddha-Gaya, has already been sketched in a previous Lecture (see pp.
392-394).

Hiouen Thsang’s description of the tree, as he saw it in the seventh
century, has also been given (see p. 399). Fa-hien, who saw it at
Buddha-Gaya in the fifth century, calls it the Patra-tree. The following
is an abridgement of what he says about it:—

  The Bodhi-sattva advanced to the Patra-tree, placed the Ku?a grass at
  the foot of it, and sat down with his <span class="t3 hoverable">face</span> to the east. Then <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span> Mara
  sent <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> beautiful damsels to tempt him. The Bodhi-sattva put his
  toes down to the ground, and the young maidens were changed into old
  grandmothers. Buddha, after attaining perfect wisdom, contemplated the
  tree for seven <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">days</span> (Legge, p. 88).

Fa-hien also saw the offspring of the original Bodhi-tree growing in
Ceylon (Legge, p. 103).

It is recorded that soon after Mahinda, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> of A?oka, arrived in Ceylon
(about 250 B.C.) for the purpose of propagating Buddhism, his sister,
who had become a Buddhist Nun, also arrived there, and <span class="t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> with her
from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span> A?oka a branch of the sacred Bodhi-tree of Buddha-Gaya. This
was planted at Anuradha-pura, and the zealous Buddhists of Ceylon fully
believe that the identical tree exists there still.

An interesting <span class="t1 t11 t12 t13 t16 t18 t21 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> of this tree or its descendant,
about thirty <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> ago, is given in Sir Emerson Tennant’s ‘Ceylon’ (vol.
ii. p. 613). I here give an abridged extract:—

  The Bo-tree of Anuradha-pura is in all probability the oldest
  historical tree in the world. Its conservancy has been an <span class="t24 t25 hoverable">object</span> of
  solicitude to successive dynasties, and the story of its vicissitudes
  has been preserved in a series of continuous chronicles.

  It <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> almost seem to verify the prophecy pronounced when it was
  planted, that it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> flourish and be green for ever.

  The degree of sanctity with which this extraordinary tree has been
  invested by Buddhists, may be compared to the feeling of veneration
  with which Christians regard the attested wood of the Cross.

  The other Bo-trees which are found in the vicinity of every temple in
  Ceylon are said to be all derived from the parent-tree at
  Anuradha-pura, but they have been propagated by seeds; the priesthood
  adhering in this respect to the precedent recorded in the Maha-va??a
  (when Mahinda himself, taking up a fruit as it fell, gave it to the
  <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> to plant), and objecting religiously to lop it with any weapon.

  In the fifth century Fa-hien found the Bo-tree at Anuradha-pura in
  vigorous health, and its guardians displaying towards it the same
  vigilant tenderness which they exhibit at the present day.

  The author of the Maha-va??a, who wrote between the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> 459 and 478
  of our era, after relating the ceremonial which had been observed
  nearly eight hundred <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> before, at the planting of the venerated
  tree by Mahinda, concludes by saying:—‘Thus this monarch of the
  forest, endowed with miraculous powers, has stood for ages in La?ka,
  promoting the <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> welfare of its inhabitants and the propagation
  of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> religion.’

When Buddhism became thoroughly mixed up with Hinduism the Kalpa-tree or
<span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> tree of Indra’s paradise was often introduced. It is supposed to
have its terrestrial counterpart in some sacred spots on earth, and
there to grant all desires, the worshipper having merely to stretch out
his <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> the gifts suspended from its branches[272]. In one
sculpture it is represented pouring out coins on the ground. This <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span>
of wishing-tree is believed to present, among other things, any <span class="t0 t14 t23 t24 hoverable">food</span>
that its worshippers may ask for, and to present it ready-cooked, if
cooking is needed.

The miraculous tree which developed out of the Buddha’s tooth-cleaning
twig, when thrown by him on the ground, has been already described (see
p. 419, and compare ‘Brahmanism and Hinduism,’ p. 337).


                           _Sacred Symbols._

Some of the sacred objects already described may be regarded as symbols.
Of those which are more strictly symbols the _Tri-ratna_ ‘three-jewel’
emblem comes first. It is three-pointed, and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> points are simply
emblematical of the Buddha, the Law, and the Monastic Order. It is often
<span class="t0 t12 hoverable">used</span> as an ornament. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Good</span> examples may be seen in some of the Bharhut
sculptures (see Sir A. Cunningham’s work). The central point is often
the least elevated.

The <span class="t1 hoverable">use</span> of this triple symbol is another proof of the connexion between
Buddhism and Hinduism. Both delight in triads and in symbolizing
triads[273], but the Buddhist ‘three-jewel’ symbol should not be
confused with the Hindu Tri-?ula, which is ?iva’s trident <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">used</span> as a
weapon in his warfare with the demons. The Tri-ratna is merely the
analogue of the Tri-?ula, as it is also of the triple horizontal mark on
the forehead of ?aivas, and of the Tri-pu??ra or triple frontal mark of
the Tengalai sect of Ramanuja Vaish?avas. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> outer marks of the
latter stand for Vish?u’s <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> feet and the middle for his consort
Lakshmi[274].

Sir A. Cunningham was the first to show that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> fetish-like
figures of Jagannath (K?ish?a) and his sister and brother, at Puri in
Orissa, were derived from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> of the combined emblems of the Buddhist
Tri-ratna (compare p. 166 of this volume).

Next to the Tri-ratna comes the _Cakra_ or wheel. This symbolizes the
Buddhist doctrine that the origin of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> and of the universe (p. 119)
are unknowable—the doctrine of a circle of causes and effects <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span>
beginning and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> end. The wheel also typifies the rolling of this
doctrine over the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> surface of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> (pp. 410, 423). It is
perhaps one of the most important symbols of Buddhist philosophy. It is
often represented as either supporting the Tri-ratna or supported by it,
or the latter may be inserted in it.

Observe that the Cakra or wheel is equally a Vaish?ava symbol, but in
the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> of Vish?u or of K?ish?a it is a circular weapon, hurled at a
demon-foe.

Another symbol is the _Lotus-flower_. Its constant <span class="t1 hoverable">use</span> as an emblem,
seems to result from the wheel-like <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of the flower—the petals taking
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> of spokes, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> typifying the doctrine of perpetual cycles
of existence—or from the perfection typified by the regularity of these
petals, or from the <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> that its expanded flower, reposing on a calm
mirror-like lake, is a fit emblem of Nirva?a.

The Wheel, the Tri-ratna, and the Lotus are so important, as symbols of
Buddhism, that they are combined in the vignette on the title-page of
this volume.

Another symbol is the _Svastika_ mark, consisting of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> lines crossing
each other, the termination of each arm of the cross being usually bent
round in the same direction[275]. Much controversy has been devoted to
the origin and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> of this symbol, which simply symbolizes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span>
luck, and equally belongs to Hinduism. <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">Long</span> ago I propounded a theory
that it might represent the four arms of Lakshmi. I now think it a mere
curtailed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of the Wheel, consisting of four spokes with a portion of
the periphery of the circle. In my opinion, the four spokes may
represent the four groups of worlds (i. e. the lower worlds and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span>
groups of heavens, p. 213) circling in an <span class="t0 t28 hoverable">eternal</span> cycle. Sir A.
Cunningham considers this symbol to be a monogram or interlacing of the
letters of the auspicious <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> _su asti_ (_svasti_) in the A?oka
characters.

Another symbol is the _Throne_ or seat of Buddha—a favourite emblem in
many sculptures. In Cunningham’s ‘Stupa of Bharhut’ the throne of each
<span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> is often represented under his Bodhi-tree (but <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> any
image), and the thrones of the last four Buddhas are joined <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> in
a single bas-relief. Sometimes the throne is covered by an umbrella with
garlands, or the Buddha’s bowl may rest on it. Sometimes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> foot-prints
are on a foot-stool under the throne.

Another venerated symbol is the _Stupa_ (see p. 505). It is often an
<span class="t24 t25 hoverable">object</span> of adoration in itself.

I need scarcely revert to the _Umbrella_ symbol (see p. 393). In Eastern
countries it typifies supremacy. If a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> is present no one else ought
to carry an umbrella.

The _?a?kha_ or _Conch-shell_ is a very auspicious symbol, especially if
the convolutions turn to the right in the Nandy-avarta form, as on the
Buddha’s foot (see p. 513).

The Tibetan symbol of the ‘_Flying horse_’ (Lung-ta)—able to transport a
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> round the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> in one day—has been mentioned before; also the
_Norbu_ gem (see pp. 381, 528).


                           _Sacred Animals._

It may be truly said that all animals are more or less venerated—though
not actually worshipped—under the Buddhist system. How can it be
otherwise when every Buddhist believes that the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> himself was
incarnated in various animals during the period of his Bodhi-sattvaship
(see p. 111)?

In the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> the Hindus believe that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">god</span> Vish?u was incarnated in
animals, such as a fish, a tortoise, and a boar.

Buddhism in this as in other respects is like Brahmanism and Hinduism.
The feeling of reverence for animals rests on the doctrine of
metempsychosis. It is difficult for either a Hindu or a Buddhist to draw
a line of demarcation between gods, men, and animals, when the same
living being may exist as a god, a man, or an animal. It is on this
<span class="t1 t11 t12 t13 t16 t18 t21 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> that in India animals appear to live on terms of the greatest
friendship and mutual confidence with <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> beings.

  Everywhere in India animals dispute possession of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> with man.
  Birds build their nests and lay their eggs in the fields, untroubled
  by fears or misgivings, before the very <span class="t2 t6 t19 t20 t26 t29 hoverable">eyes</span> of every passer-by, and
  <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">within</span> the reach of every village school-boy. Animals rove over the
  soil as if they were the landlords. Bulls walk about independently in
  the streets, and jostle you on the pavements; monkeys domesticate
  themselves jauntily on the roof of your house; parrots peer
  inquisitively from the eaves of your bedroom into the mysteries of
  your toilet; crows make themselves at home on your window-sill, and
  carry off impudently any portable article of jewellery that takes
  their fancy on your dressing-table; sparrows hop about impertinently
  and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> the bread off your table-cloth; a solitary mongoose emerges
  every morning from a hole in your verandah, and expects a share in
  your breakfast; swarms of insects claim a portion of your mid-day
  meal, and levy a tax on the choicest delicacies at your dinner table;
  bats career triumphantly about your <span class="t1 t4 t9 t16 hoverable">head</span> as you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> yourself to your
  bedroom; and at certain seasons snakes domicile themselves
  unpleasantly in the folds of your cast-off garments. (Quoted from my
  ‘Brahmanism and Hinduism.’)

Perhaps the most sacred animal in the estimation of all Buddhists is the
elephant. This will be easily understood by recalling what has been said
in a previous Lecture (see pp. 23, 24). In one of the Bharhut sculptures
the white elephant is seen descending to enter the side of Gautama’s
mother Maya (‘Stupa of Bharhut,’ p. 84). The elephant, says Sir A.
Cunningham, is a favourite subject for delineation. It is represented in
almost every possible position, as standing, walking, running, sitting
down, eating, drinking, throwing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> over its own back, and lastly,
kneeling down in reverence before the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">holy</span> Bodhi-tree.

Probably the next sacred animal to the elephant is the deer. The <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span>
was <span class="t9 t24 hoverable">born</span> eleven times as a deer (p. 111), and he delivered his first
sermon in a deer-park (p. 42). The ‘goose’ (Ha?sa, sometimes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> ‘a
duck’ or ‘a swan’) is also very sacred. With regard to other animals,
Sir A. Cunningham remarks:—

  The animals represented in the Bharhut sculptures are of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> classes,
  the natural and the fabulous. The latter, however, are limited to
  <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> varieties, an elephant with a fish-tail, a crocodile with a
  fish-tail, and a winged horse; while the former comprises no less than
  fourteen quadrupeds, six birds, one snake, one fish, one insect, one
  crocodile, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> tortoises, one lizard, and one frog. The quadrupeds
  include the lion, elephant, horse, rhinoceros, wild boar, bull, deer,
  wolf, monkey, cat, dog, sheep, hare, and squirrel. The birds comprise
  the cock, parrot, peacock, goose, wild duck, and quail. The snakes and
  fishes appear to be of only one kind. The solitary insect is a
  flesh-fly (p. 41, etc.).

In Burma <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> feed sacred fish, and save their lives in seasons when
they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> perish through the drying up of rivers and ponds (see p.
364).

Dr. Eitel, in his Lectures (p. 136), points out that even pigs are held
sacred, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> not worshipped, by Northern Buddhists. We must not forget
that the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> of his births was a pig (p. 112), that he died of
eating pork, and that in sculptures of the Tantrik goddess
Vajra-varahi—adopted by Northern Buddhists—a row of seven pigs is carved
underneath her three-headed figure, one <span class="t1 t4 t9 t16 hoverable">head</span> being that of a pig.


                        _Miscellaneous Objects._

Among these may be reckoned _bells_ of various kinds. The prayer-bells
common in Tibet, which are held in the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> and <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">used</span> during the chanting
of prayers, have been already described (p. 323).

In Burma bells abound everywhere. They are of all sizes, and often of
immense weight, but are not <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">used</span> in the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> as in Tibet. Nor are
they ever rung in peals or with a clapper. Their <span class="t1 hoverable">use</span> is not to <span class="t8 t13 t21 hoverable">call</span>
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> to religious services. It is no part of the business of monks or
priests to summon the laity to any service. Every <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> worships on his
own account, and for himself, and by himself, and no so-called priest
reminds him of his religious duties, or is responsible if he neglects
them.

The real <span class="t1 hoverable">use</span> of bells in Burmese temples is to draw the attention of the
deities and spirits (Naths) to the act of worship, and so secure the due
registering of prayer-merit. When a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> has finished his repetitions, he
strikes the bell with a piece of wood or other sacred implement lying
near, and the more noise he makes the better. Mr. Scott informs us that
every large pagoda has dozens of bells of all sizes, hanging outside,
and one or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> inside the central shrine. They are constantly dedicated
by religious people, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> multiplied _ad infinitum_.

The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of dedication is inscribed on every bell, and is in the Pali
language, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> instances of the vernacular occur.

The following is a portion of a remarkable inscription in the vernacular
(Shway Yoe, i. 243, abridged):—

  This bell was moulded with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> care and much expense, and is humbly
  offered by Moung San Yah and his wife, who seek refuge in the
  boundless mercy of the pitiful Buddha, in the majesty of the <span class="t0 t28 hoverable">eternal</span>
  law, and in the examples of the venerable assembly. They humbly strive
  to gain merit for themselves. May the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> Naths look smilingly on
  them. May the Naths who dwell in the air and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> defend their

May the
  guardian Naths of the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> and of the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">city</span> keep Chit Oo, their son,
  and little Mah Mee, their darling daughter, from harm.

The weight of the bell is generally added to the dedication.

There is a fine Burmese bell in the Indian section of the South
Kensington Museum. It has a <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> Pali inscription, a portion of the
translation of which I here give:—

  ‘Without charity you cannot attain to Nirva?a’—so it is <span class="t2 t11 t15 t19 t25 t27 hoverable">written</span> in the
  Pali Texts.

  I, the giver of this bell, was staying in the sweet-smelling town of
  Ma-oo—of which I collect the taxes for the king—and with me was my
  wife—my life’s breath—like to the pollen of a lily, from whom I will
  not be separated in all the existences which are to come, and out of
  which we hope soon to escape. We adore Buddha, that we may embark in
  the golden raft of the Noble Path, which will lead us to the final
  plunge into Nirva?a. We two, brother and sister (that is, husband and
  wife), have given this bell as an offering. The exact weight of the
  bell is 2500 kyats. We <span class="t2 t4 t6 t9 t18 t19 t22 hoverable">took</span> our own weight in gold and silver and
  bright copper and other metal, and mixed them <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> together, in the
  year 1209 (1847 A.D.).

  Now I will record all the alms I gave and what I erected <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">within</span> the
  sacred enclosure. I gave a sacred flag-staff (see p. 380 of these
  Lectures), the price of which, with all expenses in putting up, was
  500 rupees. At the foot of it I built four small pagodas. Outside I
  built a monastery and a rest-house. Such are all the offerings. May I
  be freed from the Four states of Punishment, from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Three</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Great</span>

  <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> in the thirty-one places of habitation throughout the universe.
  (See p. 121 of these Lectures.)

Under the <span class="t1 t4 t9 t16 hoverable">head</span> of miscellaneous objects, we may <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">note</span> the seven precious
minerals or substances to which allusion has frequently been made. They
are gold, silver, pearl, sapphire or ruby, cat’s eye, diamond, and coral
(Childers); but they vary, and some authorities substitute lapis lazuli
for pearl. In Hinduism there are nine precious substances (nava-ratna).

We may also enumerate here the seven treasures belonging to every
universal monarch. These are:—1. a wheel which, being <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> in motion by
the monarch, rolls before him to establish the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Law</span> in his dominions; 2.
an elephant; 3. a flying horse (see p. 523); 4. a jewel which on the
darkest night illuminates the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> for seven miles round (p. 381); 5. a

‘Wheel of the Law,’ p. 81).




_Supplementary Remarks on the Connexion of Buddhism with Jainism[276]._


Having during the progress of the foregoing Lectures, incidentally
mentioned the subject of Jainism, I ought not to conclude them <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span>
explaining some of the chief points of difference between the system of
the Jainas (conveniently contracted into Jains) and that of the
Buddhists. The Jains in India, according to their own reckoning, <span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span>
1,222,000; but this is incorrect, for by the last Census they only
<span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span> half a million. A <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> authority (Sir William Wilson Hunter)
confirms this. (See his ‘Gazetteer’ and ‘Indian Empire.’)

Most scholars in the present <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> are of opinion that the Jaina Teacher
Vardhamana Maha-vira (Nataputta) and Gautama <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> were contemporaries,
and that Jains were an independent sceptical sect, probably a little
antecedent to the Buddhists, and were their rivals. At any rate it seems
certain that the Niga??has[277] or Dig-ambara Jains, that is, a sect of
naked ascetics, existed before the Buddha’s time, and that the Tripi?aka
alludes to them.

Probably Vardhamana Maha-vira (usually <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Maha-vira) was merely a
reformer of a system previously founded by a teacher named Par?va-natha.
Not much is known of the latter, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> he is greatly honoured by the
Jains. His images are ‘serpent-canopied’ like those of <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> (p. 480).
His pupils are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Pasavaccijja (for Par?vapatyiya, ‘belonging to the
descendants of Par?va’). They were only bound by four vows, whereas
Maha-vira’s teaching imposed five vows.

We have seen that Gautama Buddha, in the fifth century B.C., came to the
conclusion that bodily austerities were useless as a means of obtaining
liberation. His main <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> seems to have been that liberation from the
painful cycle of continued re-births, that is, from Sa?sara, was to be
obtained by means of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> (Bodhi), evolved out of the inner
<span class="t0 t1 t13 t16 t24 t25 hoverable">consciousness</span> through meditation (dhyana) and intuition; whereas, in
contradistinction to this Buddhist idea, the main <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> of the Jain
teacher Maha-vira seems to have been that liberation was to be obtained
through subjugation of the passions and through mortification of the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> (tapas). The term Jina, ‘conqueror,’ is <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">used</span> in both systems, but
Gautama <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> was a Jina or conqueror through profound abstract
meditation, whereas Maha-vira was a Jina through severe bodily
austerity.

In fact, the Jains, like all other ascetics, were impressed with the
<span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> that it was necessary to maintain a defensive warfare against the
assault of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> passions, by keeping under the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> and subduing it.
They had also a notion that a <span class="t0 t1 t7 t12 t13 t14 t17 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">sense</span> of shame implied sin, so that if
there were no <span class="t2 t5 t8 t17 t18 t19 hoverable">sin</span> in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> there <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be no shame. Hence they
argued rather illogically that to get rid of clothes was to get rid of
sin; and every ascetic who aimed at sinlessness was enjoined to walk
about naked, with the air or sky (Dig) as his sole covering
(Dig-ambara).

In the Kalpa-sutra of the Jains we read that Maha-vira himself began his
career by wearing clothes for one year and one month, and after that he
walked about naked. Now Gautama <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> was an opponent of Jain
asceticism, and it seems to me probable that one of the chief points on
which he laid stress was that of decent clothing. In the Dhamma-pada
(141) occurs the sentiment that ‘Nakedness cannot purify a mortal who
has not overcome desires.’ And again, in the Sekhiya Dhamma we have
‘properly clad’ ‘must a monk itinerate.’ (See p. 473 of these Lectures.)

It is recorded in the Vinaya (Maha-vagga I. 6. 7-9) that Upaka, a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> of
the Ajivaka sect of naked ascetics, founded by Gosala (said to have been
a pupil of Maha-vira), met the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> just after his enlightenment, and
noticing his bright countenance, asked him who had been his teacher? He
replied, ‘Having gained all knowledge, I am myself the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t22 t23 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">highest</span> teacher.’
Thereupon the naked ascetic shook his <span class="t1 t4 t9 t16 hoverable">head</span> and <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> another road.

Clearly these naked Niga??has, disciples of the Jain Teacher Maha-vira,
were no friends of the Buddha. It seems to me even possible that
Gautama’s <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> rival, Deva-datta (see pp. 405, 406), may have belonged
to a Dig-ambara sect who opposed the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> on questions of stricter
asceticism, especially in the matter of clothing; for in <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span>
sculptures Deva-datta is generally represented naked or nearly so, and
is usually in close proximity to his cousin Gautama Buddha, who, in
marked contrast to the other, is always clothed. Evidently the question
of dress was a crucial one, and in process of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> a party seems to have
arisen, even among the Dig-ambara Jains, opposed to strict asceticism in
this particular.

This party ultimately formed themselves into a separate sect, calling
themselves ?vetambaras, that is, ‘clothed in white garments.’ It is <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span>
known that in early Buddhism <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> similar parties arose, the strict and
the lax. But the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> Buddhist parties were ultimately reunited. The
<span class="t0 t2 t5 t13 t14 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">second</span> council is supposed to have settled the controversy.

Dr. Jacobi has shown that the separation of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> Jain sects must have
<span class="t2 t5 t11 t18 t19 t23 t26 hoverable">taken</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> (according to the traditions of both parties) some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span>
before the first century of our era.

It appears probable that the strict Dig-ambaras preceded the more lax
?vetambaras, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> each sect claims to be the oldest. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> Jain
sects have remained separate to the present day, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> in all essential
points of doctrine and discipline they agree.

When I was last in India, in 1884, I ascended the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> hills, Parasnath
(for Par?va-nath) and Abu—both of them most sacred places in the
estimation of the Jains, and covered with their temples. My ascent of
the former has been already described (p. 509). I also visited Delhi,
Jaypur, Ajmere, and some other chief Jain stations. Jaypur is the
stronghold of the Dig-ambara Jains, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> intelligent Dig-ambara
Pa??its, named Pha?e Lal and Syoji Lal, visited me there. We conversed
for a <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> in Sansk?it, and I asked them many questions about their
religion, and the points in which they differed from the ?vetambara
sect.

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Three</span> chief differences were stated to be: First, the ?vetambaras <span class="t24 t25 hoverable">object</span>
to entirely nude images of any of the twenty-four Jinas or Tirtha?-karas
accepted by both sects. Hence all ?vetambara statues ought to have some
appearance of a line round the middle of the body, representing a strip
of cloth. In one respect the images of the Jinas differ from those of
the Buddhas. They have a jewel-like mark on the breast. This is
especially conspicuous in Par?va-nath. They are also of different
colours, and have symbols (generally animals, such as a deer, tortoise,
pig) connected with them.

Secondly, the ?vetambaras admit women into their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">order</span> of ascetics just
as Buddhists have their Bhikkhunis, or nuns; whereas the Dig-ambaras,
for obvious reasons, do not admit women.

Thirdly, the ?vetambaras have distinct sacred books of their own, which
they <span class="t8 t13 t21 hoverable">call</span> A?gas, ‘limbs of the Law,’ eleven in number, besides others,
making 45 Agamas, 11 A?gas, 12 Upa?gas, 10 Painnas (Prakir?aka), 4
Mulas, 6 Chedas, 1 Anuyoga-dvara, and 1 Nandi. Dr. Bühler places the
composition of the A?gas in the <span class="t26 hoverable">third</span> century B.C. Dr. Jacobi places
them at the end of the fourth or beginning of the <span class="t26 hoverable">third</span> century. They
are <span class="t2 t11 t15 t19 t25 t27 hoverable">written</span> in Jain Prak?it (sometimes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Ardha-Magadhi, a later
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> than Pali), with Sansk?it commentaries. The Dig-ambaras substitute,
for the A?gas, later works, also <span class="t2 t11 t15 t19 t25 t27 hoverable">written</span> in more modern Prak?it
(probably in the fifth or sixth century after Christ), and maintain that
the ?vetambara Canon is spurious. Both sects have valuable Sansk?it
<span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t7 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">works</span> in their sacred literature.

I now add a few characteristics of both sects of Jains as distinguishing
them from Buddhists.

I need scarcely notice the <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> that the Jains of the present <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> keep
up Caste. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> Jain Pa??its who came to me at Jaypur were Brahmans,
and wore the Brahmanical thread. I believe this to be a mere modern
innovation, which does not properly belong to the Jain system.

More important are the following points:—The Jain saints, or prophets,
are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> by a peculiar name Tirtha?-kara, ‘ford-makers,’ i. e. making
a ford across the troubled river of constant births or transmigrations
(Sa?sara) to the Elysium of Nirva?a; whereas the name Tirtha?-kara with
the Buddhists means a ‘heretical teacher.’ Then there are twenty-four
Jain Tirtha?-karas, whereas there are twenty-five Buddhas. Of the
twenty-four Jain saints, the twenty-third and twenty-fourth—Par?va-nath
(pp. 509, 529) and Maha-vira—are the only historical personages. The
others, beginning with ?ishabha, are mythical.

Next, the Jains have no Stupas or Dagabas (p. 504) for preserving the
relics of their saints.

Still more important is the point that the Jains believe in separate
<span class="t22 t25 hoverable">individual</span> souls (Jiva), whereas the Buddhists deny the existence of
souls. Souls, according to the Jains, may exist in stocks, stones, lumps
of earth, drops of water, particles of fire. In Buddhism there is, as we
have seen, no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> metempsychosis, but rather a connected series of
metamorphoses, and this stops at animals; whereas the metempsychosis of
Jainism extends to inorganic matter.

With regard to the moral code <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> points may be noticed. The
Jaina ‘three jewels’ are Right-belief, Right-knowledge, and
Right-conduct, whereas the Buddhist Tri-ratna consists in the well-known
Triad—the Buddha, the Law, and the Monkhood.

Then as to the five chief Moral Prohibitions—the fifth with Jains is:
‘have no worldly attachments;’ whereas with Buddhists it is: ‘drink no
strong drink.’ I believe the Buddhists to have been the first to
introduce total abstinence from strong drinks into India. The Jains,
too, lay even more stress than the Buddhists on the first
prohibition:—Kill no living creature. They strain <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> before drinking,
sweep the ground with a silken brush before sitting down on it, never
<span class="t6 hoverable">eat</span> in the dark, often wear muslin before their mouths to catch minute
insects, and even <span class="t24 t25 hoverable">object</span> to eating fruits containing seed.

Another interesting difference is that Jainism makes Dharma and Adharma,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> and evil, or rather merit and demerit, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> out of its six real
substances—its fundamental and <span class="t0 t28 hoverable">eternal</span> principles (Astikaya)—the other
four being matter (pudgala), <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> (jiva), space and time. The Jains
reject the Buddhist theory of the five Skandhas (see p. 109).

Lastly, the prayer-formula of the Jains differs from the well-known
‘three-refuge’ formula of the Buddhists (‘I go for refuge to the Buddha,
the Law, and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">order</span> of Monks’) thus: ‘Reverence to the Arhats, to the
Siddhas, to the Acaryas, to the Upadhyayas, to all the Sadhus’ (Namo
Arihanta?a? namo Siddha?a? namo Ayariya?a? namo Uvajjhaya?a? namo loe
sabba-sahu?a?).

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Time</span> will not permit me to notice minor differences, such as the Jain
rule that the hair should be painfully torn off, instead of cut off,
etc.

Certainly Jainism, when viewed from the stand-point of Christianity, is
even a colder system than Buddhism, and has even less claim to be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span>
a religion. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> no system can show a greater <span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span> of temples. Every
Jain who is noted for his piety builds a small temple. He never repairs
the temples of others. At Palitana in Kathiawar, there is a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">city</span>
of Jain temples. Nor is it at all necessary that every temple built to
hold a Jain saint should possess either priests or worshippers. What is
aimed at is the acquisition of merit by the performance of pious acts.

I must conclude by expressing my opinion that Indian Jainism is
gradually drifting back into the current of Brahmanism, which everywhere
surrounds it and attracts it. Jainism, like Buddhism, came out from
Brahmanism, and into Brahmanism it is destined to return.




                             LECTURE XVIII.
                _Buddhism contrasted with Christianity._


In the previous Lectures I have incidentally contrasted the principal
doctrines of Buddhism with those of Christianity.

It will be my aim in this concluding Lecture to draw attention more
directly and more in detail to the main points of divergence between <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span>
systems, which in their moral teaching have so many points of contact,
that a superficial study of either is apt to lead to very confused ideas
in regard to their comparative excellence and their resemblance to each
other.

And first of all I must remind those who <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t18 hoverable">heard</span> my earlier Lectures of
the grand fundamental distinction which they were intended to
establish—namely, that Christianity is a religion, whereas Buddhism, at
least in its earliest and truest form, is no religion at all, but a mere
system of morality and philosophy founded on a pessimistic theory of
life.

Here, however, it may be objected that, before we exclude Buddhism from
all title to be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> a religion, we ought to define what we mean by
the term ‘religion.’

Of course, it will be generally acknowledged that mere morality need not
imply religion, though—taking the converse—it is most undeniably <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span>
that religion must of necessity imply morality.

Unquestionably there have been <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> philosophers in <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> times who
have lived strictly moral lives <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> acknowledging any religious
creed at all. Many excellent men, too, exist among us in the present
day, who resent being <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> irreligious, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> hold no definite
religious doctrines, and decline to accept any system which commits them
to absolute belief in anything except an <span class="t0 t28 hoverable">eternal</span> Energy or Force.

Clearly the definition of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> ‘religion’ is beset with
difficulties, and its etymology is too uncertain to help us in
explaining it[278]. We shall, however, be justified if we affirm that
every system claiming to be a religion in the proper <span class="t0 t1 t7 t12 t13 t14 t17 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">sense</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span>
must postulate the <span class="t0 t28 hoverable">eternal</span> existence of one living and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> of
infinite power, wisdom, and love, the Creator, Designer, and Preserver
of all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> visible and invisible.

It must also <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> for granted the immortality of man’s <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> or spirit,
and the reality of a future <span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> and of an unseen world. It must also
postulate in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> an innate <span class="t0 t1 t7 t12 t13 t14 t17 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">sense</span> of dependence on a personal God—a <span class="t0 t1 t7 t12 t13 t14 t17 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">sense</span>
of reverence and <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> for Him, springing from a belief in His justice,
holiness, wisdom, power, and love, and intensified by a deep
<span class="t0 t1 t13 t16 t24 t25 hoverable">consciousness</span> of weakness, and a yearning to be delivered from the
presence, tyranny, and penalty of sin.

Then, starting from these assumptions, it must satisfy four requisites.

First, it must reveal the Creator in His <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> and attributes to His
creature, man.

Secondly, it must reveal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> to himself. It must impart to him a
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of his own <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> and history—what he is; why he was created;
whither he is tending; and <span class="t0 t5 t8 t10 t14 t15 t21 t24 t28 hoverable">whether</span> he is at present in a <span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> of
decadence downwards from a <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> condition, or of development upwards
from a lower.

Thirdly, it must reveal some method by which the finite creature may
communicate with the infinite Creator—some plan by which he may gain
access to Him and become united with Him, and be saved by Him from the
consequences of his own sinful acts.

Fourthly, such a system must prove its title to be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> a religion by
its regenerating effect on man’s nature; by its influence on his
thoughts, desires, passions, and feelings; by its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of subduing all
his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> tendencies; by its ability to transform his character and
assimilate him to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> it reveals.

It is clear, then, that tried by such a criterion as this, early
Buddhism could not claim to be a religion. It failed to satisfy these
conditions. It refused to admit the existence of a personal Creator, or
of man’s dependence on a <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> Power. It denied any <span class="t0 t28 hoverable">eternal</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> or Ego
in man. It acknowledged no external, supernatural revelation. It had no
priesthood—no real clergy; no real prayer; no real worship. It had no
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> of sin, or of the need of pardon (p. 124), and it condemned
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> to suffer the consequences of his own sinful acts <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> hope of
help from any Saviour or Redeemer, and indeed from any being but
himself.

The late Bishop of Calcutta once said to me, that being in an outlying
part of his diocese, where Buddhism prevailed, he asked an apparently
pious Buddhist, whom he happened to observe praying in a temple, what he
had just been praying for? He replied, ‘I have been praying for
nothing.’ ‘But,’ urged the Bishop, ‘to whom have you been praying?’ The
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> answered, ‘I have been praying to nobody.’ ‘What!’ said the
astonished Bishop, ‘praying for nothing to nobody?’ And no doubt this
anecdote gives an accurate <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> of the so-called prayer of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span>
Buddhist. This <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> had not really been praying for anything. He had been
merely making <span class="t1 hoverable">use</span> of some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> to which an efficacy, like that
of sowing fruitful seed in a field, was supposed to belong. He had not
been praying in any Christian sense.

Here, however, an objector might remind me that according to my own
showing, various developments of Buddhism modified and even contradicted
the original creed, and that what has been here said about prayer, is
only strictly applicable to early Buddhism as originally taught in the
most <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> texts.

I grant this—I grant that expressions of reverence for the Buddha, the
Law, and the Monkhood, developed into expressions of wants and needs,
and that these expressions, gradually led on to the <span class="t6 hoverable">offering</span> of actual
prayers to deified Buddhas and Bodhi-sattvas.

I admit that we ought to judge of Buddhism as a whole. We ought to give
<span class="t10 t16 hoverable">full</span> consideration to its later developments, and the gradual sliding of
its atheism and agnosticism into theism and polytheism. We are bound to
acknowledge that Buddhism, as it extended to other countries, _did_
acquire the character of a theistic religious system, which, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span>
false, had in it some points of contact with Christianity.

Nevertheless, admitting all this, and taking into <span class="t1 t11 t12 t13 t16 t18 t21 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> all that can
be said in favour of Buddhism as a religious system, it will be easy to
show how impossible it is to bridge over the yawning chasm which
separates it from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> religion.

It is, indeed, one of the strange phenomena of the present day, that
even educated <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> who <span class="t8 t13 t21 hoverable">call</span> themselves Christians, are apt to fall
into raptures over the precepts of Buddhism[279], attracted by the
bright gems which its admirers delight in culling out of its moral code,
and in displaying ostentatiously, while keeping out of sight all its
dark spots, all its trivialities and senseless repetitions[280]; not to
<span class="t6 t9 t11 t19 t20 t22 hoverable">speak</span> of all those evidences of deep corruption beneath a whited
surface, all those significant precepts and prohibitions in its books of
discipline, which indeed no Christian could soil his lips by
uttering[281].

It has even been asserted that much of the teaching in the Sermon on the
Mount, and in other parts of the Gospel narratives, is based on
previously current moral teaching, which Buddhism was the first to
introduce to the world, 500 <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> before Christ[282]. But this is not
all. The admirers of Buddhism maintain that the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> was not a mere
teacher of the truths of morality, but of many other sublime truths. He
has been justly called, say they, ‘the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Light</span> of Asia,’ <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> they
condescendingly admit that Christianity as a later development is more
adapted to become the religion of the world.

Let us then inquire, for a moment, what claim Gautama <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> has to this
title—‘the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Light</span> of Asia?’

Now, in the first <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> those who give him this name forget that his
doctrines only spread over Eastern Asia, and that either Confucius, or
Zoroaster, or Muhammad might equally be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> ‘the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Light</span> of Asia.’

But was the Buddha, in any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> sense, a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Light</span> to any part of the world?

It is certainly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> that the main <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> implied by Buddhism is
intellectual enlightenment. Buddhism, before all things, means
enlightenment of mind, resulting from intense self-concentration and
introspection, from intense abstract meditation, combined with the
exercise of a man’s own reasoning faculties and intuitions.

Of what nature, then, was the so-called <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Light</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Knowledge</span> that radiated
from the Buddha? Was it the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of his own utter weakness, of his
original depravity of heart, or of the origin of sin? No; the Buddha’s
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> was in these respects profound darkness. He confessed himself, in
regard to such momentous questions, a downright Agnostic. The primary
origin of evil—the first <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> act—was to him an inexplicable mystery.

Was it, then, a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of the goodness, justice, holiness, and
omnipotence of a personal Creator? Was it a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of the Fatherhood
of God? No; the Buddha’s <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> was in these respects also mere and sheer
darkness. In these respects, too, he acknowledged himself a thorough
Agnostic. He admitted that he knew of no being <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> than himself.

What, then, was the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> that broke <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the Buddha? What was this
enlightenment which has been so much <span class="t2 t11 t15 t19 t25 t27 hoverable">written</span> about and extolled? All
that he claimed to have discovered was the origin of suffering and the
remedy of suffering. All the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> to which he attained
came to this:—that suffering arises from indulging desires, especially
the <span class="t0 t10 t11 t17 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">desire</span> for continuity of life; that suffering is inseparable from
life; that all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> is suffering; and that suffering is to be got rid of
by the suppression of desires, and by the extinction of personal
existence.

Here, then, is the first <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> contrast. When the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> said to his
converts, ‘Come (ehi), be my disciple,’ he bade them expect to get rid
of suffering, he told them to stamp out suffering by stamping out
desires (see pp. 43, 44). When the <span class="t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t13 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">Christ</span> said to His disciples, ‘Come,
follow Me,’ He bade them expect suffering. He told them to <span class="t3 t22 t28 hoverable">glory</span> in
their sufferings—nay, to expect the perfection of their characters
through suffering.

It is certainly noteworthy that both Christianity and Buddhism agree in
asserting that all <span class="t0 t1 t5 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">creation</span> groaneth and travaileth in pain, in
suffering, in tribulation. But mark the vast, the vital distinction in
the teaching of each. The one taught <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> to be patient under affliction,
and to aim at the glorification of the suffering body, the other taught
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> to be intolerant of affliction, and to aim at the utter annihilation
of the suffering body.

What says our Bible? We Christians, it says, are members of Christ’s
Body—of His <span class="t6 t20 hoverable">flesh</span> and of His bones—of that <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Body</span> which was once a
suffering Body, a cross-bearing Body, and is now a glorified Body, an
ever-living, life-giving Body. Hence it teaches us to honour and revere
the <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> body; nay, almost to deify the <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> body.

A Buddhist, on the other hand, treats every <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> with contempt,
and repudiates as a simple impossibility, all <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> of being a member of
the Buddha’s body. How could a Buddhist be a member of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> which was
burnt to ashes—which was calcined,—which became extinct at the moment
when the Buddha’s <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> personality became extinguished also?

But, say the admirers of Buddhism, at least you will admit that the
<span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> told <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> to avoid sin, and to aim at purity and holiness of life?
Nothing of the kind. The <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> had no <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> of <span class="t2 t5 t8 t17 t18 t19 hoverable">sin</span> as an offence against
God, no <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> holiness (see p. 124). What he said was—Get rid of
the demerit of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> actions and accumulate a stock of merit by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span>
actions.

And let me remark here that this determination to store up merit—like

humanity which nothing but the <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> force imparted by Christianity can
ever eradicate. It is for ever cropping up in the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">heart</span> of man, as much
in the West as in the East, as much in the North as in the South; for
ever re-asserting itself like a pestilent weed, or like tares amidst the

Only the other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> I met an intelligent Sikh from the Panjab, and asked
him about his religion. He replied, ‘I am no idolater; I believe in One
God, and I repeat my prayers, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> “Jap-jee,” every morning and
evening. These prayers occupy six pages of print, but I can get through
them in little more than ten minutes.’ He seemed to pride himself on
this rapid recitation as a <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> of increased merit.

I said, ‘What else does your religion require of you?’ He replied, ‘I
have made one pilgrimage to a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">holy</span> <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> near Amritsar. Eighty-five steps
lead down to it. I descended and bathed in the sacred pool. Then I
ascended one step and repeated my Jap-jee with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> rapidity. Then I
descended again to the pool and bathed again, and ascended to the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t13 t14 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">second</span>
step and repeated my prayers a <span class="t0 t2 t5 t13 t14 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">second</span> time. Then I descended a <span class="t26 hoverable">third</span>
time, and ascended to the <span class="t26 hoverable">third</span> step and repeated my Jap-jee a <span class="t26 hoverable">third</span>
time, and so on for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> eighty-five steps, eighty-five bathings
and eighty-five repetitions of the same prayers. It <span class="t2 t4 t6 t9 t18 t19 t22 hoverable">took</span> me exactly
fourteen hours, from 5 p.m. one evening to 7 a.m. next morning, and I
fasted all the time.’

I asked, ‘What <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> did you expect to get by going through this task?’
He replied, ‘I hope I have laid up an abundant store of merit, which
will last me for a <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> time.’

This, let me tell you, is a genuine Hindu notion. It is of the very
essence of Brahmanism, of Hinduism, of Zoroastrianism, of Confucianism,
of Muhammadanism. It is even more of the essence of Buddhism. For, of
all systems, Buddhism is the one which lays most stress on the
accumulation of merit by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> actions, as the sole counterpoise to the
mighty force generated by the accumulation of demerit through <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span>
actions in present and previous forms of life. Nor did the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> ever
claim to be a deliverer from guilt, a purger from the taint of past
pollution. He never pretended to <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> any one <span class="t1 t8 hoverable">free</span> from the penalty,
power, and presence of sin—from the bondage of sinful acts and besetting
vices. He never professed to furnish any cure for the leprosy of man’s
corrupt nature—any medicine for a dying sinner[283]. On the contrary, by
his doctrine of Karma he bound a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> and foot to the inevitable
consequences of his own <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> actions with chains of adamant. He said, in
effect, to every one of his disciples, ‘You are in slavery to a tyrant
of your own setting up; your own deeds, words, and thoughts in your
present and former states of being, are your own avengers through a
countless series of existences.

  “Your acts your angels are for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> or ill,
  Your fatal shadows that walk by you still.”

‘If you have been a murderer, a thief, a liar, impure, a drunkard, you
must pay the penalty in your next birth—perhaps as a sufferer in one of
the hells[284], perhaps in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> of a wild beast, perhaps in that of

proclaim liberty to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind,

Yes, in <span class="t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t13 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">Christ</span> alone there is deliverance from the bondage of former
transgressions, from the prison-house of former sins; a total cancelling
of the past; a complete blotting-out of the handwriting that is against
us; an entire washing away of every guilty stain; the opening of a clear
course for every <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> to start afresh; the <span class="t1 t8 hoverable">free</span> gift of pardon and of

inveterate.

Still, I seem to hear some admirers of Buddhism say: We admit the force
of these contrasts, but surely you will allow that in the moral <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">law</span> of

Christianity—precepts which tell a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> not to <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> the world, not to

Well, I admit all this. Nay, I admit even more than this; for many
Buddhist precepts command total abstinence in cases where Christianity
demands only temperance and moderation. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> contrast, as I have
already explained, between the moral precepts of Buddhism and
Christianity, is not so much in the letter of the precepts, as in the

Buddhism, I repeat, says: Act righteously through your own efforts, and
for the final getting rid of all suffering, of all individuality, of all
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> in yourselves. Christianity says: Be righteous through a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span>

principle, freely given to you, and always abiding in you. The <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span>
said to his followers: ‘Take nothing from me, trust to yourselves
alone.’ <span class="t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t13 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">Christ</span> said: ‘Take all from Me; trust not to yourselves. I give

you living water.’ Not that these priceless gifts involve any passive
condition of inaction. On the contrary, they stir the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> of the
recipient with a living energy. They stimulate him to noble deeds, and
self-sacrificing efforts. They compel him to act as the worthy,
grateful, and appreciative possessor of so inestimable a treasure.

Still, I seem to hear some one say: We acknowledge this; we admit the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> of what you have stated; nevertheless, for all that, you must
allow that Buddhism conferred a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> benefit on India by encouraging

before entangled in the meshes of ceremonial observances and Brahmanical
priestcraft.

Yes, I grant this; nay, I grant even more than this. I admit that
Buddhism conferred many other benefits on the millions inhabiting the
most populous part of Asia. It introduced education and culture; it
encouraged literature and art; it promoted physical, moral, and
intellectual progress up to a certain point; it proclaimed peace, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span>
will, and brotherhood among men; it deprecated war between nation and
nation; it avowed sympathy with social liberty and freedom; it gave back
much independence to women; it preached purity in thought, word, and
deed (though only for the accumulation of merit); it taught self-denial

creatures; it forbade avarice and the hoarding of money; and from its

condition, it did <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> service for a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> in preventing stagnation,
stimulating exertion, promoting <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t7 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">works</span> of all kinds, and elevating
the character of humanity.

Then again, when it spread to outlying countries it assumed the
character of a religion; it taught the existence of unseen worlds; it
permitted the <span class="t6 hoverable">offering</span> of prayers to Maitreya and other supposed
personal saviours; it inculcated <span class="t7 t13 t19 t20 t29 hoverable">faith</span> and trust in these celestial
beings, which operated as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> motives in the hearts of many, while the
hope of being <span class="t9 t24 hoverable">born</span> in <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> conditions of life, and the <span class="t0 t10 t11 t17 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">desire</span> to
acquire merit by reverential acts, led to the development of devotional
services, which had much in common with those performed in Christian
countries. Nay, it must even be admitted that many Buddhists in the
present <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> are deeply imbued with religious feelings, and in no part of
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> are the outward manifestations of religion—such as temples and
sacred objects of all kinds—so conspicuous as in modern Buddhist
countries.

But if, after making all these concessions, I am told that, on my own
showing, Buddhism was a <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of introduction to Christianity, or that
Christianity is a <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of development of Buddhism, I must ask you to
bear with me a little longer, while I point out certain other contrasts,
which ought to make it clear to every reasonable man, how vast, how
profound, how impassable is the gulf separating the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> religion from
the false philosophy, and from the later religious systems developed out
of it.

And first, observe that Buddhism has never claimed to be an exclusive
system. It has never aimed at taking the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> of other religions. On
the contrary it tolerates all, and a Buddhist considers that he may be
at the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> a Hindu, a Confucianist, a Taoist, a Shintoist, and
even, strange to say, a Christian.

A Christian, on the other hand, holds as a cardinal doctrine of his
religion, that there is only one Name under <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heaven</span> given among men,
whereby any <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> being can be saved. To be at the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> a believer
in <span class="t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t13 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">Christ</span> and a believer in <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> implies an utter contradiction in
terms.

Then it need scarcely be repeated here that <span class="t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t13 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">Christ</span> is before all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span>
a majestic example of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> historic personality. Any really
historical, matter-of-fact <span class="t1 t11 t12 t13 t16 t18 t21 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of Buddha, like that of
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of <span class="t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t13 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">Christ</span> by the four Evangelists, may be looked for in vain
through all the Buddhist scriptures. The Buddha’s biography is mixed up
with such monstrous legends, absurd figments, and extravagant fables,
that to attempt the sifting out of any really historical element worthy
of being compared with the pregnant simplicity—the dignified brevity of
the biography of Christ, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be an idle task.

Still we may <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">note</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> obvious points of comparison and
contrast.

And perhaps the most important is, that <span class="t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t13 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">Christ</span> constantly insisted on
the <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> that He was God-sent, whereas the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> always described
himself as self sent. How indeed could the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> have said ‘the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> I

existence of any Ego at all? Not even in the reality of his own
individuality.

All that he affirmed of himself was that he came into the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> to be a
teacher of perfect wisdom, by a force derived from his own acts. By that
force alone he had passed through innumerable bodies of gods, demi-gods,
demons, men, and animals, until he reached one out of numerous heavens,
and thence by his own will descended <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> and entered the side of
his mother in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of a white elephant (see pp. 23, 477). Let those
who <span class="t6 t9 t11 t19 t20 t22 hoverable">speak</span> of his ‘virgin-mother’ bear this in mind.

Christ, on the other hand, made known to his disciples, that He was with
His <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Father</span> from everlasting, ‘Before Abraham was, I am.’ Then in the
fulness of time, He was _sent_ into the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> by His Father, and was
<span class="t9 t24 hoverable">born</span> of a pure virgin, through the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">Holy</span> Spirit, in the
likeness and fashion of men.

Next let us <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">note</span> a vast contrast in the <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> that <span class="t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t13 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">Christ</span> was sent from
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heaven</span> to be <span class="t9 t24 hoverable">born</span> on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> in a poor and humble station, to be reared in
a cottage, to be trained to toilsome labour as a working-man; whereas
the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> came down to be <span class="t9 t24 hoverable">born</span> on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> in a rich and princely family;
to be <span class="t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> up amid luxurious surroundings, and finally to go forth as
a mendicant-monk, depending <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> others for his daily <span class="t0 t14 t23 t24 hoverable">food</span> and doing
nothing for his own support.

Then, again, <span class="t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t13 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">Christ</span> as He grew up showed no signs of earthly majesty in
his external form, whereas the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> is described as marked with
certain mystic symbols of universal monarchy on his feet and on his
hands, and taller and more stately in frame and figure than ordinary
<span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t0 t1 t15 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> (see pp. 476, 501).

Then, when each entered on his ministry as a teacher, <span class="t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t13 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">Christ</span> was
despised and rejected by kings and princes, and followed by poor and
ignorant fishermen, by common people, publicans, and sinners; <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> was
honoured by kings and princes, and followed by rich <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> and learned
disciples.

Then <span class="t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t13 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">Christ</span> had all the treasures of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> hidden in Himself, and
made known to His disciples that He was Himself the Way, and the
Truth,—Himself their Wisdom, Righteousness, Sanctification, and
Redemption. <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> declared that all enlightenment and <span class="t7 t8 t12 hoverable">wisdom</span> were to be
attained by his disciples, not through him, but through themselves and
their own intuitions; and that, too, only after <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> and painful
discipline in countless successive bodily existences.

Then in regard to the miracles which both the Bible and the Tripi?aka
describe as attestations of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> of the teaching of each, contrast
the simple and dignified statement that ‘the blind receive their sight,
the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are
raised up, and the poor have the gospel preached <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">unto</span> them[288],’ with
the following description of the Buddha’s miracles in the Maha-vagga (I.
20, 24)[289]: ‘At the command of the <span class="t2 t15 t24 hoverable">Blessed</span> One the five hundred pieces
of fire-wood could not be split and were split, the fires could not be
lit up and were lit up, could not be extinguished and were extinguished.
Besides he created five hundred vessels with fire. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> the <span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span> of
these miracles amounts to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> <span class="t6 hoverable">thousand</span> five hundred.’

Then, although each made <span class="t1 hoverable">use</span> of missionary agency, the one sent forth
his high-born learned monks as missionaries to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> at the
commencement of his own career, giving them no <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> commission; the
other waited till the close of His own ministry, and then said to His
low-born, unlearned disciples, ‘As My <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Father</span> <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hath</span> sent Me, even so send
I you’ (St. John xx. 21).

Then, when we come to compare the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> of each, the contrast reaches
its climax; for <span class="t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t13 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">Christ</span> was put to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> violently by wicked men, and
died in agony an atoning death, suffering for the sins of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> at
the age of thirty-three, leaving behind in <span class="t2 t6 t26 hoverable">Jerusalem</span> about one hundred
and twenty disciples after a short ministry of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> years. Whereas the
<span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> died peacefully among his friends, suffering from an attack of
indigestion at the age of eighty, leaving behind many thousands of
disciples after forty-five <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> of teaching and preaching.

And what happened after the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> of each? Christ, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">Holy</span> One, saw no
corruption, but rose again in His present glorified body, and is alive
for evermore—nay, has <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> in Himself ever flowing in life-giving
streams towards His people. The <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> is dead and gone for ever; his
body, according to the testimony of his own disciples, was burnt more
than 400 <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> before the Advent of Christ, and its ashes were
distributed everywhere as relics.

Even according to the Buddha’s own declaration, he now lives only in the
doctrine which he <span class="t1 t7 t12 t29 hoverable">left</span> behind him for the guidance of his followers.

And here again, in regard to the doctrine <span class="t1 t7 t12 t29 hoverable">left</span> behind by each, a vast
distinction is to be noted. For the doctrine delivered by <span class="t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t13 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">Christ</span> to His
disciples is to spread by degrees everywhere until it prevails
eternally. Whereas the doctrine <span class="t1 t7 t12 t29 hoverable">left</span> by Buddha, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> it advanced
rapidly by leaps and bounds, is, according to his own admission, to fade
away by degrees, till at the end of 5000 <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> it has disappeared
altogether from the earth, and another <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> must descend to restore
it. (Compare Postscript at end of Preface, p. xiv.)

Then that other <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> must be followed by countless succeeding Buddhas
in succeeding ages, whereas there is only one Christ, who can have no
successor, for He is alive for ever and for ever present with His
people: ‘Lo, I am with you alway, even <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">unto</span> the end of the world.’

Then observe that, although the Buddha’s doctrine was ultimately <span class="t2 t11 t15 t19 t25 t27 hoverable">written</span>
down by his disciples in certain collections of books, in the same
manner as the doctrine of Christ, a fundamental difference of
character—nay, a vast and impassable gulf of difference—separates the
Sacred Books of each, the Bible of the Christian and the Bible of the
Buddhist.

The characteristic of the Christian’s Bible is that it claims to be a
supernatural revelation, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> it attaches no mystical talismanic virtue
to the mere sound of its words. On the other hand, the characteristic of
the Buddhist Bible is that it utterly repudiates all claim to be a
supernatural revelation; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> the very sound of its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> is believed to
possess a meritorious efficacy capable of elevating any one who hears it
to heavenly abodes in future existences. In illustration I may advert to
a legend current in Ceylon, that once on a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> 500 bats lived in a cave
where <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> monks daily recited the Buddha’s Law. These bats gained such
merit by simply hearing the sound of the words, that, when they died,
they were all re-born as men, and ultimately as gods.

Then as to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> themselves, contrast the severely simple and
dignified style of the Bible narrative, its brevity, perspicuity,
vigour, and sublimity, its trueness to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> and inimitable pathos,
with the feeble utterances, the tedious diffuseness, and I might almost
say ‘the inane twaddle’ and childish repetitions of the greater portion
of the Tripi?aka (see <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">note</span> 2, p. 541).

But again, I am sure to hear the admirers of Buddhism say: Is it not the
<span class="t5 t16 t21 t24 t25 hoverable">case</span> that the doctrine of Buddha, like the doctrine of Christ, has
self-sacrifice as its key-note? Well, be it so. I admit that the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span>
taught a <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of self-sacrifice. I admit that he related of himself
that, on a particular occasion in one of his previous births[290], he
plucked out his own eyes, and, that on another, he cut off his own <span class="t1 t4 t9 t16 hoverable">head</span>
as a <span class="t3 t5 t10 t16 t23 t26 t29 hoverable">sacrifice</span> for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> of others; and that again, on a <span class="t26 hoverable">third</span>
occasion, he cut his own <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> to pieces to redeem a dove from a
hawk[291]. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">note</span> the vast distinction between the self-sacrifice
taught by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> systems. Christianity demands the suppression of
selfishness; Buddhism demands the suppression of self, with the one
<span class="t24 t25 hoverable">object</span> of extinguishing all <span class="t0 t1 t13 t16 t24 t25 hoverable">consciousness</span> of self. In the one, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span>
self is elevated and intensified. In the other, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> self is
annihilated by the practice of a false <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of non-selfishness, which
has for its real object, not the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> of others, but the annihilation of
the Ego, the utter extinction of the illusion of personal individuality.

Furthermore, observe the following contrasts in the doctrines which each
bequeathed to his followers:—

According to Christianity:—Fight and overcome the world.

According to Buddhism:—Shun the world, and withdraw from it.

According to Christianity:—Expect a new <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> when the present <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> is
destroyed; a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> renewed and perfected; a purified <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> in which
righteousness is to dwell for ever.

According to Buddhism:—Expect a never-ending succession of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> worlds
for ever coming into existence, developing, decaying, perishing, and
reviving, and all equally <span class="t10 t16 hoverable">full</span> of everlasting misery, disappointment,
illusion, change, and transmutation.

According to Christianity, bodily existence is subject to only one
transformation.

According to Buddhism, bodily existence is continued in six conditions,
through countless bodies of men, animals, demons, ghosts, and dwellers
in various hells and heavens; and that, too, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> any progressive
development, but in a constant jumble of metamorphoses and
transmutations (see p. 122).

Christianity teaches that a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heaven</span> can never be followed by a
fall to a lower state.

Buddhism teaches that a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> in a <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heaven</span> may be succeeded by a
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> in a lower heaven, or even by a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> or in one of the
hells.

According to Christianity, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> may be the abode of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">Holy</span>

According to Buddhism, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> <span class="t0 t5 t8 t10 t14 t15 t21 t24 t28 hoverable">whether</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> or of <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> <span class="t0 t1 t15 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> can
never be the abode of anything but evil.

According to Christianity:—Present your bodies as living sacrifices,
holy, acceptable to God, and expect a change to glorified bodies
hereafter.

According to Buddhism:—Look to final deliverance from all bodily life,
present and to come, as the greatest of all blessings, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t22 t23 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">highest</span> of all
boons, and loftiest of all aims.

According to Christianity, a man’s <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> can never be changed into the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> of a beast, or bird, or insect, or loathsome vermin.

According to Buddhism, a man, and even a god, may become an animal of
any kind, and even the most loathsome vermin may again become a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> or a
god.

According to Christianity:—Stray not from God’s ways; offend not against
His <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">holy</span> laws.

According to Buddhism:—Stray not from the eight-fold path of the perfect
man, and offend not against yourself and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">law</span> of the perfect man.

According to Christianity:—Work the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t7 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">works</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> while it is day.

According to Buddhism:—Beware of action, as causing re-birth, and aim at
inaction, indifference, and apathy, as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t22 t23 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">highest</span> of all states.

Then <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">note</span> other contrasts.

According to the Christian Bible:—Regulate and sanctify the heart,
desires, and affections.

According to the Buddhist:—Suppress and destroy them utterly, if you
wish for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> sanctification.

Christianity teaches that in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t22 t23 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">highest</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of life, <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> is
intensified.

Buddhism teaches that in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t22 t23 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">highest</span> <span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> of existence, all <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> is
extinguished.

According to Christianity:—Go and earn your own bread, support yourself
and your family. Marriage, it says, is honourable and undefiled, and
married <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> is a field on which holiness may grow and be developed.
Nay, more—Christ Himself honoured a wedding with His presence, and <span class="t2 t4 t6 t9 t18 t19 t22 hoverable">took</span>
up little <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">children</span> in His arms and <span class="t2 t15 t24 hoverable">blessed</span> them.

Buddhism, on the other hand, says:—Avoid married life; shun it as if it
were ‘a burning pit of live coals’ (p. 88); or, having entered on it,
abandon wife, children, and home, and go about as celibate monks,
engaging in nothing but in meditation and recitation of the Buddha’s
Law—that is to say—if you aim at the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t22 t23 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">highest</span> degree of sanctification.

And then comes the important contrast that in the one system we have a
teaching gratifying to the pride of man, and flattering to his
intellect; while in the other we have a teaching humbling to his pride,
and distasteful to his intellect. For Christianity tells us that we must
become as little children, and that when we have done all that we can,
we are still unprofitable servants. Whereas Buddhism teaches that every
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> is saved by his own <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t7 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">works</span> and by his own merits only.

Fitly, indeed, do the rags worn by the monks of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> Buddhism symbolize
the miserable patchwork of its own self-righteousness.

Not that Christianity ignores the necessity for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> works; on the
contrary, no other system insists on a lofty morality so strongly; but
never as the meritorious instrument of salvation[292]—only as a
thank-offering, only as the outcome and evidence of faith.

Lastly, we must advert again to the most momentous—the most essential of
all the distinctions which separate Christianity from Buddhism.
Christianity regards personal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> as the most sacred of all

utter annihilation of the Ego—of all existence in any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> whatever, and

What shall I do to inherit <span class="t0 t28 hoverable">eternal</span> life?—says the Christian. What shall
I do to inherit <span class="t0 t28 hoverable">eternal</span> extinction of life?—says the Buddhist.

It seems a mere absurdity to have to ask in concluding these
Lectures:—Whom shall we choose as our Guide, our Hope, our Salvation,

living, the eternal, the life-giving Christ?


                              POSTSCRIPT.

Since the printing of my concluding Lecture, it has occurred to me that
I ought to make a few remarks in regard to a very prevalent error—the
error that Buddhism still numbers more adherents than any other religion
of the world. For these remarks the reader is referred to the Postscript
at the end of the Preface (p. xiv).

[1]‘Life of Alexander Duff, D.D., LL.D., by George Smith, C.I.E., LL.D.’
    London: Hodder and Stoughton; published first in 1879, and a popular
    edition in 1881.

[2]A reference to pages 74, 226, 232 of the following Lectures will make
    the connexion which I wish to illustrate clearer. In many images of
    the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> the robe is drawn over both shoulders, as in the portrait
    of the living Sannyasi. Then mark other particulars in the
    portrait:—e.g. the Rudraksha rosary round the neck (see ‘Brahmanism
    and Hinduism,’ p. 67). Then in front of the raised seat of the
    Sannyasi are certain ceremonial implements. First, observe the
    Kama??alu, or water-gourd, near the right <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> corner of the seat.
    Next, in front of the seat, on the right <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> of the figure, is the
    Upa-patra—a subsidiary vessel to be <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">used</span> with the Kama??alu. Then,
    in the middle, is the Tamra-patra or copper vessel, and on the <span class="t1 t7 t12 t29 hoverable">left</span>
    the Pañca-patra with the Acamani (see ‘Brahmanism and Hinduism,’ pp.
    401, 402). Near the <span class="t1 t7 t12 t29 hoverable">left</span> <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> corner of the seat are the wooden
    clogs. Finally, there is the Da??a or staff held in the <span class="t1 t7 t12 t29 hoverable">left</span> hand,
    and <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">used</span> by a Sannyasi as a defence against <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> spirits, much as
    the Dorje (or Vajra) is <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">used</span> by Northern Buddhist monks (see p. 323
    of the present volume). This mystical staff is a bambu with six
    knots, possibly symbolical of six ways (Gati) or states of life,
    through which it is believed that every being may have to migrate—a
    belief common to both Brahmanism and Buddhism (see p. 122 of this
    volume). The staff is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Su-dar?ana (a name for Vish?u’s Cakra),
    and is daily worshipped for the preservation of its mysterious
    powers. The mystic white roll which begins just above the <span class="t1 t7 t12 t29 hoverable">left</span> <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span>
    and ends before the <span class="t1 t7 t12 t29 hoverable">left</span> knot is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the Lakshmi-vastra, or
    auspicious covering. The projecting piece of cloth folded in the
    <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of an axe (Para?u) represents the weapon of Para?u-Rama, one of
    the incarnations of Vish?u (see pp. 110, 270 of ‘Brahmanism and
    Hinduism’) with which he subdued the enemies of the Brahmans. With
    this so-called axe may be contrasted the Buddhist weapon for keeping
    off the powers of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> (engraved at p. 352).

[9]It is difficult to accept the theory of those who maintain that
    writing had not been invented.

[10]One hundred is given as a round number. The actual distance is about
    one hundred and twenty miles.—_Corr._

[11]Tapas is a Sansk?it word, derived from the root tap, ‘to burn,
    torment.’ It is connected with Lat. tepeo, Greek {Thaptô}, which
    last originally denoted ‘to burn,’ not ‘to bury’ dead bodies. Tapas
    ought not to be translated by ‘penance,’ unless that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> is

    Institute, Oxford.

[13]According to Dr. Oldenberg, the M?ityu of the Ka?hopanishad.

[14]In the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> the Cistercian monks of Fountain’s Abbey lived under
    certain trees while the Abbey was building.

[15]The Bhagavad-gita (V. 28) asserts:—‘The sage (Yogi) who is
    internally happy, internally at peace, and internally illumined,
    attains extinction in Brahma.’ This is pure Buddhism if we
    substitute Cessation of <span class="t22 t25 hoverable">individual</span> existence for Brahma.

    miles east of Gorakh-pore on an old channel of the Chota Gandak.

[17]I give 420 as a round number. Rhys Davids has <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> reasons for

    480, Cunningham 478, Kern 388. The old date is 543.

[19]The ?atapatha-brahma?a (p. 1064) and the B?ihad-ara?yaka Upanishad
    (p. 455) affirm that the ?ig- Yajur- Sama- and Atharva-veda, the
    Upanishads, Itihasas, and Pura?as were all the breath (ni??vasitani)
    of the Supreme Being. And Saya?a, the well-known Indian Commentator
    on the ?ig-veda, speaking of the Supreme Being in his Introduction,
    says, Yasya ni??vasita? Veda?, ‘whose breath the Vedas were.’

[20]How else can we <span class="t1 t11 t12 t13 t16 t18 t21 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> for Pa?ini’s applying the term Bhasha to
    colloquial Sansk?it? Professor E. B. Cowell holds that Pa?ini’s
    standard is the Brahma?a language as opposed to the Sa?hita of the
    Veda and to Loka or ordinary usage.

[21]According to Professor Rhys Davids, the Pali <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">text</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span>

    translation, if all repetitions were given, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be about four
    times as long. I should <span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> here that in this <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">chapter</span> Koeppen,

    myself.

[22]Upali is said to have been originally the family barber of the
    ?akyas. Professor Oldenberg rightly remarks that this did not make
    him a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> of low position, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> he was probably the lowest in rank
    of all the early disciples of Gautama.

[23]Professor Oldenberg, in his preface to his edition of the
    Maha-vagga, shows that in early times there were only <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> divisions

    which were often contrasted.

[24]The ten usually enumerated are the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> above-named and seven

    others as a valid excuse for relaxing discipline.

[25]According to Professor Oldenberg’s calculation. The date is
    doubtful. A round <span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span> (say 350 B.C.) might be given.

[26]Professor Oldenberg places the locality of the Pali on the eastern
    coast of Southern India in the northern part of Kali?ga (Puri in
    Orissa), and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> make it an old <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of Uriya. That

    the line or series of texts, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> pali like tanti <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span>
    ‘line.’ Pali differs from the Prak?it of the Inscriptions, and from
    that of the dramas, and from that of the Jainas (which is still
    later and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Ardha-magadhi), by its retention of some consonants

[29]The seven are called: 1. Dhamma-sa?ga?i, ‘enumeration of conditions
    of existence,’ edited by Dr. E. Müller; 2. Vibha?ga, ‘explanations;’
    3. Katha-vatthu, ‘discussions on one <span class="t6 hoverable">thousand</span> controverted points;’
    4. Puggala-paññatti, ‘explanation of personality;’ 5. Dhatu-katha,
    ‘account of elements;’ 6. Yamaka, ‘pairs;’ 7. Pa??hana, ‘causes.’

[30]A list of these is given in Childers’ Dictionary.

[31]See Introduction to Buddha-ghosha’s Parables, by Professor Max
    Müller; Turnour’s Maha-va??a, pp. 250-253.

[32]They are in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> quite distinct kinds of writing. That at

    clearly Semitic, and traceable to a Phœnician source, being <span class="t2 t11 t15 t19 t25 t27 hoverable">written</span>
    from right to left. That at Girnar, commonly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Southern A?oka

    traceable. If it came from the west it probably came through a
    Pahlavi channel, and gave rise to Devanagari. General Cunningham and
    others believe this latter character to have originated
    independently in India. James Prinsep was the first to decipher the
    inscription character.

[33]See Dr. R. N. Cust’s article in the ‘Journal of the National Indian
    Association’ for June, 1879, and one of his Selected Essays, and
    General Sir A. Cunningham’s <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> work, ‘The Corpus Inscriptionum
    Indicarum.’ The General reckons thirteen rock inscriptions,
    seventeen cave inscriptions, and six inscribed pillars.

    The eight most important rock inscriptions are those on (1) the Rock
    of Kapurda-garhi (at Shahbaz-garhi), in British Afghanistan, forty
    miles east-north-east of Peshawar—this is in the Ariano-Pali
    character; (2) the Rock of Khalsi, situated on the bank of the river
    Jumna, just where it leaves the Himalaya mountains, fifteen miles
    west of the hill-station of Mussourie; (3) the Rock of Girnar,
    half-a-mile to the east of the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">city</span> of Junagurh, in Kathiawar; (4)
    the Rock of Dhauli, in Kuttack (properly Ka?ak), twenty miles north
    of Jagan-nath; (5) the Rock of Jaugada, in a large old fort eighteen
    miles west-north-west of Ganjam in Madras; (6) Bairat; (7) Rupnath,
    at the foot of the Kaimur range; (8) Sahasaram, at the north-east
    end of the Kaimur. The <span class="t0 t2 t5 t13 t14 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">second</span> Bairat inscription is most important
    as the only one which mentions <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> by name.

    The five most important pillars are: (1) the Pillar at Delhi known
    as Firoz Shah’s La?; (2) another Pillar at Delhi, which was removed
    to Calcutta, but has recently been restored; (3) the Pillar at
    Allahabad, a single shaft <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> capital, of polished sandstone,
    thirty-five feet in height; (4) the Pillar at Lauriya, near Bettiah,
    in Bengal; (5) the Pillar at another Lauriya, seventy-seven miles
    north-west of Patna.

[34]Hiouen Thsang states that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> commentaries were engraved on
    sheets of copper and buried in a Stupa. Beal, I. 152-156.

[35]Our <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> _monk_ (derived from {monachos}, ‘one who lives alone,’) is
    not quite suitable unless it be <span class="t2 t5 t11 t18 t19 t23 t26 hoverable">taken</span> to mean ‘one who withdraws
    from worldly life.’ See p. 75.

[36]Although he discouraged, he did not prohibit monks from living
    solitary lives. See p. 132 as to the Pratyeka-Buddha, and note, p.
    72.

[37]Some prefer to derive the Pali ?ama?o from the Sansk?it root ?am,
    ‘to be quiet.’ ?ma?anika, ‘frequenting burning grounds,’ is a later
    name, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> being to monks a <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of graveyard.

[38]We may <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">note</span> that in the ‘Clay-Cart,’ a Sansk?it drama <span class="t2 t11 t15 t19 t25 t27 hoverable">written</span> in an
    early century of our era, a gambler becomes a Buddhist monk.

[39]I hear from Dr. Oldenberg that the mention in his ‘Buddha’ of twelve
    <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> as the minimum is a mistake. The age of eight mentioned by
    Prof. Rhys Davids as the minimum, must be a modern rule peculiar to
    Ceylon, if it be admissible at all.

[40]I give these quotations to show the unsuitableness of the term
    ‘Ordination’ applied to Pabbajja and Upasampada in the S. B. E.

[41]In Maha-vagga I. 30. 4, five kinds of dwellings are named besides
    trees, viz. Viharas, A??hayogas (a <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> shaped like
    Garu?a), storied dwellings (prasada), mansions (harmya), and caves
    (guha).

[42]Comparing Western with Eastern Monachism, I may remark that the
    chief duty of the lay-brethren attached to the Cistercian monastery
    at Fountain’s Abbey was to wait <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the monks, procure <span class="t0 t14 t23 t24 hoverable">food</span> and
    cook it for them; and we learn from the _Times_ of December 24,
    1885, that the same duty devolved on the Carthusian lay-brothers.

[43]The Chronicles of Ceylon <span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> that 80,000 laymen entered the paths
    in Kashmir. Compare Divyavadana, p. 166, line 12; p. 271, 12.

[44]See Tevijja-Sutta, S. B. E. §§ 14, 15.

[45]The venerable Svami ?ri Saccidananda Sarasvati, in sending me a copy
    of the Bhagavad-gita with a metrical commentary, says, ‘It is the
    best of all books on the Hindu religion, and contains the essence of
    all kinds of religious philosophy.’ I <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> in the Madras _Times_ for
    October 29, 1886, the following: ‘At a meeting of the “Society for
    the Propagation of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">True</span> Religion,” at 6 p.m. to-day, the
    Bhagavad-gita will be read and explained.’

[46]XIV. 7. 2. 17. This was first pointed out by Professor A. Weber.

[47]Centenarians (?atayus, ?ata-varsha) seem to have been rather common
    in India in <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> times, if we may judge by the allusions to them
    in Manu and other works. See Manu III. 186; II. 135, 137.

[48]I here merely give the substance of what may be found fully stated
    in Aristotle’s Ethics, I. 1 and IV. 3.

[49]That is, Sa?khara = Sansk?it Sa?skara? pl. (see p. 109), ‘qualities
    forming character.’ In the Vai?eshika system Sa?skara is one of the
    twenty-four qualities, the self-reproductive quality. In the Yoga
    system Sa?skara = Ä?aya, ‘impressions derived from actions done in
    previous births.’ According to Childers, Sa?karo is practically =
    Karma, ‘act.’ It may also stand for ‘matter,’ and for a quality, or
    mode of being; e.g. not only for a plant but for its greenness.

[50]The Pali in Maha-v° I. 23. 5, is:—Ye dhamma hetuppabhava tesa? hetu?
    Tathagato aha tesa? ca yo nirodho evamvadi Maha-sama?o. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span>
    Tathagato is also common in Sansk?it versions. The metrical <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of
    the sentence has become broken.

    Professor Cowell informs me that the Sanks?it given in an old MS. at
    Cambridge is:—‘Ye dharma hetu-prabhava hetu? tesha? Tathagata? | Hy
    avadat tesha? ca yo nirodha eva?-vadi Maha-?rama?a?.’ Burnouf gives
    a slightly different version, thus:—Ye dharma hetu-prabhavas tesha?
    hetu? Tathagata uvaca tesha? ca etc. Sometimes both _avadat_ and
    _uvaca_ are omitted.

[51]Sometimes a <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> being is said to be made up of the five
    elements—ether, air, fire, water, earth—with a sixth <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Vijñana.

[52]The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> is often compared to a <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">city</span> with nine gates or apertures,
    which have to be guarded (viz. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> eyes, ears, nostrils, etc.).

[53]In <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> Gautama remained a Bodhi-sattva until he was thirty-four or
    thirty-five, when he attained perfect enlightenment and Buddhahood.

[54]Their names are Dipa?kara, Kau??inya, Ma?gala, Sumanas, Raivata,
    ?obhita, Anavama-dar?in, Padma, Narada, Padmottara, Sumedhas,
    Sujata, Priya-dar?in, Artha-dar?in, Dharma-dar?in, Siddhartha,
    Tishya, Pushya, Vipa?yin, ?ikhin, Vi?va-bhu, Krakucanda, Kanaka-muni
    (or Ko?agamana), Ka?yapa.

[55]Beginning with Vipa?yin. These are the only Buddhas mentioned in the
    Digha-nikaya. If the coming <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> Maitreya is reckoned, then
    Vipa?yin must be omitted.

[56]It must not be inferred that the episode of the Bhagavad-gita is of
    <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> antiquity. This point I have made clear in ‘Brahmanism and
    Hinduism’ (p. 63) as <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as in ‘Indian Wisdom.’ My <span class="t24 t25 hoverable">object</span> at p. 138
    is simply to show that Nirva?a is an expression common to Buddhism,
    Brahmanism, and Hinduism.—_Corr._

[57]The expression Brahma-nirva?a is repeated several times afterwards.
    Mark, too, that one of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">god</span> ?iva’s names in the Maha-bharata is
    Nirva?am.

[58]Raga, dvesha, moha. Eleven fires are sometimes enumerated.

[59]Dr. Rhys Davids holds that the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> only advocated the suppression
    of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> desires; Fausböll says ‘desire in all its forms.’ I agree
    with the latter.

[60]When I was on the confines of Tibet, this was described to me by a
    Tibetan scholar as the unchangeable <span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> of conscious beatitude.

[61]Or _Anupadi-?esha_, that is, Nirva?a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> remains or remnants of
    the elements of existence. See Childers’ Pali Dictionary, s. v.

[62]This was remarked by Hooker when travelling in Sikkim. Sir Richard
    Temple in his Journals (II. 216) asserts that he often found married
    monks in Sikkim, and they make no secret of it. They are <span class="t1 t8 hoverable">free</span> to
    resign the monastic character when they choose.

[63]The Vaibhashika was divided into Sarvastivada (assertion of the real
    existence of all things), Mahasa?ghika, Sammatiya (said to have been
    founded by Upali), and Sthavira; the Sautrantika had also its own
    subdivisions.

    of Kanauj, who flourished about A.D. 610-650, and who is said to
    have founded an era formerly much <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">used</span> in Northern India. He ruled
    from the Indus to the Ganges, and his doings are described by Hiouen
    Thsang (Beal’s Records, I. 210-221.)

[65]The Maha-yana is said to be connected with the Madhyamika and
    Yogacara Schools, and the Hina-yana with the Vaibhashika and
    Sautrantika.

[71]As I have shown in ‘Brahmanism and Hinduism,’ the term incarnation
    is not strictly expressive of the Hindu <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> of Avatara, which means
    ‘a descent’ of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">god</span> (or a portion of his essence) in various forms

    visited by Hiouen Thsang is there given.

[76]No doubt there are places in the South of India where there is
    evidence of some violent persecution. I may instance among the
    places I visited Tanjore and Madura. When I concluded the reading of
    a paper on this subject at the meeting of the Royal Asiatic <span class="t5 t11 hoverable">Society</span>
    on February 15, 1886, the then President, Colonel Yule, justly
    remarked that the members of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> religious communions who hold very
    similar doctrines, often on that <span class="t1 t11 t12 t13 t16 t18 t21 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> hate and oppose each other
    all the more; but my point was that the ultra-tolerance which was of
    the very essence of both Brahmanism and Buddhism must have prevented
    actual persecution, except under special circumstances. Brahmanism
    was much more likely to have adopted Buddhism as part of its system,
    than to have persecuted and expelled it. In point of fact, the
    Brahmans, as is <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> known, are ready to regard any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> teacher as
    one of Vish?u’s incarnations, and in this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> are even willing to
    pay homage to the <span class="t1 t4 t9 t16 hoverable">Head</span> of Christianity.

[77]Buddhism began to lose ground in India about the fourth or fifth
    century after Christ, but it maintained a chequered career for
    several succeeding centuries even after Hiouen Thsang’s time. See p.
    161.

[78]First, the Vedic triad of gods, Agni, ‘Fire,’ Indra, ‘wielder of the
    thunderbolt,’ and Surya, ‘the Sun,’ followed by the Tri-murti or
    Brahma, ?iva, and Vish?u. Then the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> Gu?as or constituents of
    the material Universe, Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas, and lastly the
    triple name of Brahma, Sac-cid-ananda.

[79]Sarat Chandra Das, in his interesting Tibetan journal, describes
    them as the ‘three Holies.’

[82]Capt. Temple states that the Sa?gha is personified in Sikkim under
    the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> holding a lotus in his <span class="t1 t7 t12 t29 hoverable">left</span> hand, the right <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span>
    being on the right knee.

[83]Probably all the images of Dharma are meant to be female, as
    described in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">note</span> on the same page, and at p. 485.—_Corr._

[84]According to Capt. Temple, Dharma, ‘the law,’ is personified in
    Sikkim as a white woman with four arms, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> raised in prayer, the
    <span class="t26 hoverable">third</span> holding a garland (or rosary), the fourth a lotus.

[85]One legend says:—‘Thus, O monks, <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> was born, and the right side
    of his mother was not pierced, was not wounded. It remained as
    before.’ Foucaux, p. 97. Hiouen Thsang relates that there is a
    Vihara at Kapila-vastu indicating the spot ‘where the Bodhi-sattva
    descended _spiritually_ into the womb of his mother,’ and that there
    is a representation of this scene drawn in the Vihara. I have myself
    seen many representations of it in Buddhist sculptures.

[88]This work, ‘Die Religion des Buddha,’ by Carl Friederich Koeppen,
    has been <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> out of print, and has unfortunately never been
    translated into English. The German is often difficult, but I have
    endeavoured to give a correct <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> of Koeppen’s statements in the
    instances in which I have made <span class="t1 hoverable">use</span> of them. It is now somewhat out
    of date.

[89]It is obvious to remark that in the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> those who are
    intellectually self-dependent and self-raised among ourselves
    generally rise to a <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> level of popular esteem than those taught
    by other men.

[90]There was also a ‘middle way,’ see p. 159.

[91]See pp. 47, 104. Koeppen compares them to St. Peter and St. Paul.

[92]The Rev. S. Beal (Ind. Antiquary for Dec., 1886) shows that
    Nagarjuna and Nagasena are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> different persons. Sir A. Cunningham
    is of the same opinion. It may be noted that Padma-sambhava is
    credited with introducing the more corrupt <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of Buddhism along
    with magic into Tibet at a later date, probably in the eighth
    century.

[93]For the <span class="t1 t11 t12 t13 t16 t18 t21 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of Nagarjuna’s disciple Deva, mentioned by Hiouen
    Thsang, see Beal’s Records, ii. 97.

[94]Of course not to be confounded with Gautama’s disciple of the same
    name, who is generally <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Maha-Ka?yapa.

[95]According to Eitel he is still revered as the patron-saint of all
    novices, and is to be re-born as the eldest <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> of every future
    Buddha; see Legge’s Fa-hien, p. 46.

[96]The <span class="t1 hoverable">use</span> of the passive participle in an active <span class="t0 t1 t7 t12 t13 t14 t17 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">sense</span> is not uncommon
    in Sansk?it, but is generally confined to verbs involving some <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span>
    of motion.

[97]See Beal’s Records, i. 114, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">note</span> 107.

[98]Professor Legge tells us that an intelligent Chinese once asked him
    <span class="t0 t5 t8 t10 t14 t15 t21 t24 t28 hoverable">whether</span> ‘the <span class="t0 t5 t11 hoverable">worship</span> of Mary in Europe was not similar?’

[99]Legge’s Translation, p. 46. Beal, i. 180, ii. 220. According to
    Schlagintweit, a historical teacher named Mañju-?ri taught in the
    eighth or ninth century A.D.

[100]Even the Brahmas, after immense periods of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> in the Brahma
    heavens, have to go through other births in one of the six ways of
    migration. Saham-pati may <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> mean ‘the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">lord</span> of sufferers,’
    ‘all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> involving suffering,’ and this excludes the <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> of his
    ‘being <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">lord</span> over the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> who has not to be <span class="t9 t24 hoverable">born</span> again.’

[103]The images of this deity represent him as coarse and ill-favoured
    in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> (his name in <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> signifying ‘deformed’). He has sometimes
    <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> legs. As guardian of the northern quarter he is sculptured on
    the corner pillar of the northern gate of the Bharhut Stupa. He had
    a metropolis of his own, according to Hindu mythology (as we know
    from the Megha-duta), <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Alaka, on the Himalayas.

[104]A very interesting specimen of <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> sculpture representing a
    Naga-kanya may be seen in the museum of the Indian Institute,
    Oxford. It belongs to a collection of Buddhist antiquities lent by
    Mr. R. Sewell, of the Madras Civil Service.

[105]I give this as my own theory. I am no believer in the learned M.
    Senart’s <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t21 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">sun</span> theory, or in its applicability to this point.

[117]The Naths are certain demons or spirits of the air more worshipped
    in Burma than in Ceylon. See p. 259.

[118]His proper title is ?ripada Suma?gala Unnanse. The title Unnanse is
    <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">used</span> by all the superior monks of Ceylon for ‘venerable’ (Sansk?it
    _vandya_).

[119]Suma?gala informed me that this was the only prayer <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">used</span> in Ceylon.
    It is no real prayer, but only an expression of reverence. Often,
    however, wishes for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> luck are expressed like prayers. They are
    <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Ma?gala or Jaya-ma?gala. For example: ‘May I for this
    particular act of merit obtain some particular piece of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span>
    fortune!’

[120]Some connect the wizard-priest Shaman with the Buddhist ?rama?a.

[121]Lama (written in Tibetan bLama) is the Tibetan name for a superior
    teacher (Sansk?it Guru), and from this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> the hierarchical system
    of Tibet is usually <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Lamaism. It seems, however, as legitimate
    to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> Lamism from Lama, as Buddhism from Buddha. At any
    rate my adjective Lamistic is less awkward than Lamaistic. As to a
    in Lama, see Rules for pronunciation at p. xxxi.

[122]This is the Sansk?it _vandya_, ‘to be saluted.’ I cannot help
    thinking that Bante and Bandya may be the origin of the term Bonze,
    applied to monks or priests in China, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> I believe Professor
    Legge connects Bonze with Munshi.

[123]According to Dr. Schlagintweit the <span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span> of rules is 250, and they
    are detailed in the first or Dulva portion of the Kanjur.

[124]One was a Nepalese princess (called Bribsun) and the other a
    Chinese princess (called Wenching). According to Koeppen, they were
    worshipped under the general name Dara Eke—Dara standing for the
    Sansk?it Tara and Eke <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> Mother.

[125]Some write Lhasa (strictly Lhasa). I prefer Lhassa as best
    representing the pronunciation. It means ‘the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">city</span> of the gods’ (lha
    or lha).

[126]Bakshi is probably a corruption of Bhikshu. Koeppen says it is
    Mongolian for Ton. Mr. Edgar (Report, p. 39) pronounces Brom Ton
    Domton.

[127]Dr. Schlagintweit (p. 73) identifies this with the sect which wear
    _red_ dresses, but this must surely be an error for _yellow_.

[128]Through the Mongols Tibet gradually came under the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of China
    from 1255 to 1720. The dynasty in China is now Manchu.

[129]It is remarkable that the expression {ho katabas} is said of <span class="t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t13 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">Christ</span>
    in the New Testament.

[130]According to the _Times_ Correspondent Lhassa stands in no closer
    relation to China than the least dependent of Indian States to the
    British Empire; history, however, proves that China can, when her
    interests demand it, assume a very different position. The military
    <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of China is not great, but that of the Lama Government is
    nearly _nil_. The expulsion of the missionaries Huc and Gabet proves
    this.

[131]It is said by some that even his excreta are held sacred. They are
    dried, ground to powder, and either swallowed or made <span class="t1 hoverable">use</span> of as
    charms. Others deny this.

[132]In the _Times_ newspaper for June 15, 1888, is the following: ‘_How
    the Grand Lama of Tibet is appointed_.—A recent <span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span> of the
    _Peking Gazette_ contains a memorial to the Emperor from the Chinese
    Resident at Lhassa, stating that a certain Tibetan official <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span>

[135]According to one of my Japanese informants Butsu should he Bhutsu,
    and the formula should be translated, ‘Reverence to the Infinite
    Being.’

[136]My quotations from the travels of Huc and Gabet have been made from
    excellent translations by Mrs. Percy Sinnet and W. Hazlitt, but I
    have been compelled to abbreviate the extracts.

[138]I was told when in Ceylon, that many monasteries in the Kandyan
    provinces had misappropriated their endowments and dropped the
    schools, which they were bound to keep up.

[139]Notes illustrative of Buddhism as the daily religion of the
    Buddhists of Ceylon, by J. F. Dickson, M. A. Oxon.

[140]This is the derivation given by Childers; one might otherwise have
    been inclined to suspect some connexion with Preta, a ghost (pp.
    121, 219 of this volume).

[141]The <span class="t9 t12 t13 t25 hoverable">texts</span> and commentaries of some of these were collected by M.
    Grimblot, and translated with notes by M. Leon Feer, in the Journal
    Asiatique. The Tibetan Pirit is said to consist of only thirteen
    Suttas.

[142]A cold climate necessitates the addition of trousers, and boots and
    occasionally shoes are worn.

[143]This is probably permitted with a <span class="t25 hoverable">view</span> to prevent the study of
    Mongolian from entirely dying out. It is certain that, although the
    Buddhist sacred books have <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> been translated into Mongolian,
    Chinese, and Tungusic, only the Tibetan <span class="t9 t12 t13 t25 hoverable">texts</span> are esteemed as
    canonical.

[144]The indomitable persevering Hungarian traveller, Alexander Csoma de
    Körös, already mentioned (at p. 70), was the first European to throw

    the task he had imposed on himself of searching out the progenitors
    of his race. More than eighty <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> ago he <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> out on his travels,
    and his search ultimately <span class="t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> him to Tibet. There he devoted
    himself to the study of the Tibetan language and its sacred
    literature, taking up his abode in the monastery of Pugdal, in
    defiance of intense cold and other hardships. But his heroic energy
    did not end there. In 1831 he travelled from Tibet to Calcutta, and
    in that city, about the year 1834, published his Grammar and
    Dictionary of the Tibetan language, besides his table of contents of
    the Kanjur and the extra-canonical treatises. At length fancying
    himself qualified for the accomplishment of his self-inflicted task,
    he started off again, and died in Sikkim in April 1842. He is buried
    at Darjiling. We Englishmen, who ought to have <span class="t2 t5 t11 t18 t19 t23 t26 hoverable">taken</span> the greatest
    share in these linguistic conquests—so important in their bearing on
    the interests of our Indian frontier—have hitherto, to our <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>
    discredit, almost entirely neglected them. Meanwhile, St. Petersburg
    and Paris have founded chairs of the Tibetan language, and nearly
    all that has been effected for promoting the study of Tibetan has
    been due to Russian and French scholars, and to German and Moravian
    missionaries, especially to Jäschke and Hyde.

    I am glad, however, to see from the annual address delivered by the
    President of the Asiatic <span class="t5 t11 hoverable">Society</span> of Bengal, and published in the
    Report for February, 1888, that this reproach is now being wiped out
    by our fellow-subjects in India. Babu Pratapa Chandra Ghosha is
    bringing out in the Bibliotheca Indica the Tibetan translation of
    the Buddhistic <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> Prajña-paramita, forming the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t13 t14 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">second</span> division of

    Tibetan version of the Avadana-Kalpalata (a store-house of legends

    bones are easily obtained for this purpose.

[146]As before stated (p. 306, note) I have been compelled to abbreviate
    the translator’s version and occasionally to vary the expressions,
    and have <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> felt it right to omit inverted commas.

[147]According to Schlagintweit this sect (also <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Brugpa, p. 272)

[148]This I <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t18 hoverable">heard</span> from his own lips.

[149]The abstract has been made by me from a copy of Sarat Chandra Das’
    Report kindly lent to me by Sir Edwin Arnold. But I learnt much from
    Mr. S. C. D. in personal conversations. In my numerous quotations I
    have ventured to make a few alterations in the English.

[150]This is the Tibetan name of Avalokite?vara or Padma-pa?i. It is
    often spelt Chenresi, or Chenresig, or Chenressig.

[151]The Lion is an emblem of the Buddha, and he is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> ?akya-si?ha,

[152]See p. 321.

[153]See these enumerated at p. 528.

[154]See Mr. Clements Markham’s Tibet, p. cxiii.

[155]This was the Buddha’s attitude when he died (see pp. 50, 241). He
    is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> ‘a Lion.’ (See <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">note</span> 2, p. 332.)

[156]See my ‘Brahmanism and Hinduism,’ p. 367.

[157]I found, when in the South of India, that an image of Bhavani in a
    Hindu temple was very like that of the Virgin Mary in an adjacent
    Roman Catholic Church. I was told that the same Hindu carver carved
    both.

[158]We know that Hinduism, in the end, adopted <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> himself, and
    converted him into one of the incarnations of Vish?u (see
    ‘Brahmanism and Hinduism,’ p. 114).

[159]These <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> deities, according to Schlagintweit, are represented
    with formidable countenances and dark complexions, and a <span class="t26 hoverable">third</span> eye
    in the forehead—probably the eye of wisdom, as in the Dhyani-Buddhas
    (see p. 203 of these Lectures).

[161]The shape is not quite the same as that of the Phurbu, but there
    can be no doubt of its being a kindred weapon. I purchased my
    specimen at Darjiling, and was assured that it came from Tibet, and
    was <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">used</span> by the Tibetans in the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> as the Phurbu.

[164]See the translation of a horoscope given in ‘Brahmanism and
    Hinduism,’ p. 373.

[165]According to Schlagintweit, those amulets which are curved round to
    a point are intended to represent the leaf of the sacred fig-tree.

[166]In this it did <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> service, at least for a time; for the cost of
    marriage-ceremonies among the Hindus often cripples the resources of
    a family for years. The marriage of the poorest persons sometimes
    entails expenses in gifts to the Brahmans, etc., to the amount of
    300 rupees.

[167]Mr. Scott points out in his ‘Burman’ that this is especially the
    <span class="t5 t16 t21 t24 t25 hoverable">case</span> in Burma.

[168]Scott’s ‘Burman,’ p. 125.

[169]My authority for this is Mr. J. F. Dickson’s pamphlet <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> ‘Notes
    and illustrations of Buddhism,’ etc.

[170]Scott’s ‘Burman,’ i. 282.

[171]The Dagabas of laymen have no umbrellas at the top (see p. 505).
    This privilege is only accorded to the monkhood (Scott’s ‘Burman’).

[172]This is mentioned by Huc as <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as by Koeppen.

[173]He is sometimes represented seated on a Lotus, or <span class="t9 t24 hoverable">born</span> from a
    Lotus.

[174]Om is borrowed from the Hindus. It is their most sacred syllable,
    symbolical of their triad of gods, Brahma, Vish?u, and ?iva, denoted
    by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> mystical letter A, U, M (see my ‘Brahmanism,’ p. 402).
    When imported into Buddhism it may possibly symbolize the Buddhist
    triad. Om is sometimes translated by Hail! Hum, as a particle of
    solemn assent, is sometimes translated by Amen! I prefer to treat
    both Om and Hum as untranslatable ejaculations.

[175]I had formed this opinion <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> before I saw the same <span class="t25 hoverable">view</span> hinted at
    in one of Koeppen’s notes (see my ‘Brahmanism and Hinduism,’ p. 33).
    It is certainly remarkable that the name Ma?i is applied to the male
    organ, and the female is compared to a lotus-blossom in the
    Kama-?astras. I fully believe the formula to have a phallic meaning,
    because Tibetan Buddhism is undoubtedly connected with ?aivism.

[176]Some think, however, that the six syllables owe their efficacy to
    their symbolizing the six Paramitas or transcendent virtues.

[177]Dr. Schlagintweit mentions (p. 121) that when Baron Schilling
    visited a certain convent he found the Lamas occupied in preparing
    100 million copies of Om ma?i padme Hum to be inserted in a
    prayer-cylinder. He also states that the inscription relating to the
    foundation of the monastery of Hemis in Ladak (see p. 433 of these
    Lectures) records the setting up of 300,000 prayer-cylinders along
    the walls and passages of the monastery.

[178]The _Ma?i-padme_ prayer is itself for shortness often <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Ma?i.

[179]Stupas and Caityas are explained at p. 504.

[180]So says Schlagintweit, but he adds that in some places passers by
    keep them to the right. Mr. Sarat Chandra Das also mentions this.

[181]According to Sir Richard Temple (Journal, p. 198) travellers walk
    first on one side and then on the other.

[182]Schlagintweit (p. 253) says this is the horse which constitutes one
    of the seven treasures (see p. 528 of these Lectures). It brings
    <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> fortune to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> who keeps it flying on a flag.

[183]The gem <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Norbu is another of the seven treasures.

[184]Dr. Schlagintweit says that a Dhara?i to the following effect is
    often <span class="t2 t11 t15 t19 t25 t27 hoverable">written</span> on the flag: ‘Tiger, Lion, Eagle, and Dragon, may they
    co-operate Sarva-du-du-hom! (‘Tibetan Buddhism,’ p. 255).

[185]The <span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span> 108 seems sacred, as the sole of Buddha’s foot is said
    to have that <span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span> of marks <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> it.

[192]Many images and sculptures were abstracted by the Burmese, but many
    never reached Burma, for they accidentally fell into the Ganges in
    the process of being transported there. The colossal image found
    outside the temple is now in the Calcutta Museum (see the engraving
    opposite to p. 466).

[196]This will be evident to any one who examines it attentively. The
    socket-hole of the umbrella-ornament may be easily detected.

[197]The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of ritual observed was like that I witnessed at Gaya, and
    described in my ‘Brahmanism and Hinduism,’ p. 310.

[199]That is, ‘the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">lord</span> of deer.’ Sara?ga is a <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of deer, and the

    p. 111 of this volume). The legend is that he was <span class="t9 t24 hoverable">born</span> eleven times
    as a deer, and on this <span class="t1 t11 t12 t13 t16 t18 t21 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> a deer is one of the sacred symbols
    of Buddhism. We learn from General Sir A. Cunningham (i. 105) that
    the name Sarnath properly belongs to a temple dedicated to ?iva near
    the Buddhist monument, and the epithet ‘Lord of deer,’ is equally
    applicable to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">god</span> ?iva, who is often represented in the act of
    holding up a deer in his hand.

[200]The name Dhamek may possibly be a corruption of Dhamma-cakka
    (Dharma-cakra).

[201]Fa-hien says that the old <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">city</span> was girdled by five hills. These

    will be found in Cunningham’s ‘Ancient Geography of India,’ pp.
    462-468, and in his ‘Archæological Report,’ i. 20. Bimbi-sara seems
    to have built the town, which was afterwards improved by
    Ajata-?atru, and the site of the new portion being not quite
    identical, the new town was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> ‘new Raja-g?iha.’ Legge’s
    ‘Fa-hien,’ p. 81. There are several hot springs in this locality.

[202]Ajata-?atru seems first to have sided with Buddha’s enemy
    Deva-datta.

[203]It may be mentioned here that any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> or <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> in which the

    (probably from the fragrance of the perfumed offerings always to be
    found in it). Hence the Bambu grove at Raja-g?iha, and the Jeta-vana
    at Sravasti (p. 407), were both Gandha-ku?is.

[204]A magnificent edition of this <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> in Tibetan, Mongol, Manchu, and
    Chinese came into the possession of the French Missionaries (Huc,
    ii. 74).

[205]Here, therefore, there was a Gandha-ku?i (see note, p. 404).

[206]Fa-hien says, ‘Here lived <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> for a longer <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> than at any

    the Brahmacarins killed a courtesan, and accused <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> of adultery
    and murder (see Legge, p. 59; Beal, ii. 8).

[207]Legge, pp. 57, 59; Beal, ii. 5.

[208]Another statue, claiming to be the genuine sandal-wood image, was
    at Kau?ambi (see p. 412).

[209]A ku?agara is properly any building with a peaked roof (ku?a) or
    pinnacle.

[210]Cunningham (i. 301) gives a <span class="t10 t16 hoverable">full</span> <span class="t1 t11 t12 t13 t16 t18 t21 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the place.

[211]The story is fully narrated in the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t13 t14 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">second</span> and <span class="t26 hoverable">third</span> books of the

[212]See my ‘Indian Wisdom,’ p. 486.

[213]See Hiouen Thsang’s <span class="t1 t11 t12 t13 t16 t18 t21 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of it, p. 471. Another similar image
    belonged to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span> Prasenajit at ?ravasti, see pp. 408, 471.

[214]The name is said to have been derived from that of a Naga, who
    lived in a neighbouring tank. See the description in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> Chinese

[215]This Utpala must be the same as Utpala-var?a (see p. 48 of this
    volume).

[216]A Yojana is variously estimated at 4 or 5 or 9 English miles.

[217]Hiouen Thsang states that this name, which means a ‘hump-backed
    virgin,’ is derived from the <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> that an old sage (?ishi), who
    possessed supernatural powers, cursed ninety-nine daughters of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span>
    Brahma-datta for refusing to marry him, and made them deformed
    (Beal, i. 209). A different legend is given in my Sansk?it-English
    Dictionary.

[218]This is very instructive in regard to the numerical proportion
    between Brahmans and Buddhists at this place.

[219]According to Cunningham, about B.C. 450.

[220]One for each of the 84,000 elements of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> (p. 499). The real
    <span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span> of Stupas was 84, but, as usual, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> ciphers have been
    added.

[221]It is difficult to understand exactly what these A??hayoga, Prasada
    and Harmya were. In some Buddhist countries storied houses are
    considered objectionable, as no one likes to submit to the indignity
    of having the feet of another <span class="t0 t4 t5 t10 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">person</span> above his head.

[222]The objection to the hollow of trees was that spirits, ghosts, and
    goblins often <span class="t2 t4 t6 t9 t18 t19 t22 hoverable">took</span> up their abode there.

[223]The term Vihara was afterwards usually applied to temples, or to
    buildings combining temple and monastery in one.

[224]Some authorities <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> them in the sixth century of our era.

[225]This is curiously illustrated in a recent letter from a resident in
    Burma to the Editor of the _Times_ newspaper, in which it is stated
    that about six months after <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span> Theebaw had been deported, some of

    Museum, to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> disgust of his Burmese admirers, who asked,
    ‘how we dared <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> their king’s <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> in a lower room where <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span>
    could walk above them?’

[226]It is for this <span class="t1 t11 t16 t20 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">reason</span> that in the Tibetan language they are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span>
    Gonpa.

[227]So described in a pamphlet on Buddhist Monasteries in Lahoul, by a
    Moravian Missionary.

[228]Mr. Sarat Chandra Das gives the names of 1026 monasteries. Koeppen
    makes 3000 monasteries and 84,000 Lamas.

[230]The hill is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Potala, and the palace-monastery is named after
    it. Koeppen says it has <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> peaks, but the illustration in
    Markham’s <span class="t1 t11 t12 t13 t16 t18 t21 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of Manning’s journey (p. 256) shows <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span>

    140), but Koeppen (ii. 341) is more correct in stating that Potala

    Greeks, and now Tatta. There is a tradition that this Potala was the
    original home of the ?akya tribe (see p. 21 of this volume).

[231]Koeppen translates this by the German sau, but says it may also
    mean ‘Hintere Berg.’

[232]Messrs. Huc and Gabet failed in their attempt to obtain an
    interview with the Dalai Lama of 1846.

[233]It may also mean temple of Lhassa and ‘abode of gods,’ in which

[234]Huc says ‘four leagues;’ Koeppen ‘drei meilen,’ which is incorrect.

[235]These are also mentioned by Sarat Chandra Das and by Markham (p.
    130, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">note</span> 3), and again, differently spelt, at p. 264, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">note</span> 1.

[236]For his services as an explorer and surveyor Nain Singh enjoys a
    Government pension, and has been awarded the gold medal of the
    Geographical Society. Sarat Chandra Das has been made a C.I.E.

[237]My authority for all these details is Dr. Burgess’ Report.

[238]Copies of these were made for me by a Sinhalese artist.

[239]In this description I have chiefly followed Mr. Scott.

[240]This description is based on Koeppen, ii. 234, and on the narrative
    of Sarat Chandra Das’ journey in 1881, 1882.

[241]Sarat Chandra Das mentions a ‘flag-pole forty feet high, on which
    are some inscriptions, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> tufts of yak hair, and several yak and
    sheep-horns.’ Possibly this may be the obelisk mentioned by Koeppen.

[242]One of these is the terrific goddess Paldan (p. 491), worshipped by
    all Tibetans and Mongols, and identified with the goddess Kali.

[243]My authority for this is Bishop Edward Bickersteth, the present
    Bishop in Japan.

[244]See my ‘Brahmanism and Hinduism’ (published by Mr. Murray of
    Albemarle Street), pp. 2-20.

[245]Another <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> statue but not so old, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> of a highly
    interesting type, was procured by me (for the Indian Institute at
    Oxford) from Buddha-Gaya on the occasion of my last visit in 1884,
    through the <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> assistance of Mr. Beglar. It is in the erect
    attitude.

[246]See ‘Brahmanism and Hinduism,’ p. 214.

[248]When Gautama renounced his family and caste, he doubtless discarded
    the cord, just as a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> Sannyasi is required to do (p. 78).

[249]In the Jaina statues, the lobes of the ears, so far as I have
    observed, always touch the shoulders.

[250]Some think that this represents the wheel of the Cakra-varti
    emperor, or the wheel of the law, or the cycle of causes, or the
    continual revolution of births, deaths, and re-births. Dr. Mitra
    maintains that a lotus, and not a wheel, is always intended, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span>
    the lotus is often so badly carved that it may <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t11 t12 t19 t22 hoverable">pass</span> for any circular

[251]Dr. Rajendralala Mitra considers that curly locks were given to
    Gautama <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> because the possession of curls is believed to be an
    auspicious sign. Some have actually inferred from the curl-like
    knobs, that <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> was a negro!

[255]There is a striking parallel in a well-known picture by Bernardino
    Luini (of the Milan school) of ‘Christ disputing with the Doctors’
    to be seen in our National Gallery.

[257]See especially an image in the British Museum. In China Bas-relief
    images of <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> are sometimes inserted by Buddhist priests in large
    mussel-shells while the animal is living, and are covered by it with
    a coating of mother of pearl. This they <span class="t8 t13 t21 hoverable">call</span> a miracle. An example
    is in the Indian Institute, presented by Mrs. Newman Smith.

[258]The sculptured figures of Padma-pa?i observed by me in the caves of
    Elora represent him with Amitabha in his head-dress.

    Yun or Sung-Yun.

[263]‘Maha-p.’ p. 51. ‘Milinda Pañha,’ p. 177. ‘It is certainly
    noteworthy,’ says Oldenberg, ‘that as the care for Buddha’s remains
    is not represented as belonging to the disciples, so the Vinaya
    <span class="t9 t12 t13 t25 hoverable">texts</span> are nearly silent as to the last honours of the deceased
    monks. To arrange for their cremation was probably committed to the
    laity.’

[264]Subsequently <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Puri, and noted for the <span class="t0 t5 t11 hoverable">worship</span> of Jagan-nath
    or K?ish?a, who became the successor of <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> as an <span class="t24 t25 hoverable">object</span> of
    <span class="t0 t5 t11 hoverable">worship</span> (see p. 166 of this volume).

    tradition that Gautama attained to the stature of twenty cubits.

[266]Mr. Lesley, in his ‘Lectures on the Origin and Destiny of Man,’
    states that there are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> foot-prints sculptured on the summit of

    alleged foot-print of <span class="t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t13 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">Christ</span> in the Mosque of Omar, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span>

    Ishmael in the temple at Mecca. This is mentioned by Mr. Alabaster
    (p. 262).

[267]Or according to some the ?almali or Silk-cotton tree (Simal).

[268]Spence Hardy’s ‘Eastern Monachism,’ p. 215.

[269]I conjecture that the Mucalinda-tree may have been the Sandal, for
    it is described in Sansk?it literature as infested by snakes. The
    <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> of a serpent having emerged from the roots of this tree and
    protected the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> instead of injuring him, may <span class="t1 t11 t12 t13 t16 t18 t21 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> for the
    sacred character of the sandal-wood statue (see p. 408).

[270]Hardy’s ‘Eastern Monachism,’ p. 212.

[271]I noticed a fine specimen of this tree growing in the courtyard of
    the temple of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">god</span> Brahma at Pokhar, near Ajmere, visited by me
    in 1884. Near it were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> Banyan trees, a Nim tree, and A?oka tree.
    Brahma’s other temple at Idar was not visited by me.

[272]Compare my translation of ‘?akuntala,’ pp. 90, 91 (fifth edition).
    The Christmas-tree with its suspended gifts offers a curious and
    interesting analogy. The wonderful tree described by Messrs. Huc and
    Gabet as seen by them (vol. ii. p. 53, Hazlett’s translation) can
    only be regarded as an example of a remarkably clever hoax.

[273]Mr. R. Sewell has <span class="t2 t11 t15 t19 t25 t27 hoverable">written</span> an interesting article on ‘Early Buddhist
    Symbolism,’ in which he connects certain symbols with solar ideas
    derived from the West. Mr. Frederic Pincott thinks that the triple
    symbol stands for the <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> Y of the ‘Ye dharma’ formula.

[274]See my ‘Modern India,’ p. 193, published by Messrs. Trübner and
    Co., and ‘Brahmanism and Hinduism,’ p. 127.

[275]The Jaugada inscription has <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> Svastikas, the arms in each of
    which are bent in opposite directions.

[276]The expression Jainism corresponds to ?aivism, just as Jaina does
    to ?aiva. Consistency <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> require Bauddhism and Bauddha for
    Buddhism and Buddhist, but I <span class="t9 t19 hoverable">fear</span> the latter expressions are too
    firmly established.

[277]Niga??ha (also spelt Niggantha) is from the Sansk?it Nir-grantha,
    ‘having no ties or worldly associations.’

[278]Cicero (De natura deorum) derives _religion_ from relego, and
    explains it as a diligent practice of prayer and worship. Others
    have derived it from religo, and hold that it means ‘binding to
    God.’

[279]Here is an extract from a <span class="t6 t8 t10 t11 t16 t20 t21 t27 t28 hoverable">book</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> ‘The Mystery of the Ages,’

[280]As instances of the trivialities I give the following from the
    Culla-vagga (Sacred Books of the East, vol. xx. v, 31, p. 146; v, 9.

    ‘Now at that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> the Bhikkhus hung up their bowls on pins in the

    and their mouths got a bad odour. They told this matter to the
    <span class="t2 t15 t24 hoverable">Blessed</span> One. “There are these five disadvantages, O Bhikkhus, in not
    using tooth-sticks—it is bad for the eyes—the mouth becomes

    as the Bishop has done, to draw attention to the collection of
    ‘moral horrors’ existing in some parts of the Parajika books—the

[292]A Buddhist writer in a Buddhist magazine, published in Ceylon, has
    lately <span class="t2 t5 t11 t18 t19 t23 t26 hoverable">taken</span> me to task for asserting in a recent speech that

    instrument of salvation. It is easy to quote passages, such as those

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the <span class="t1 t8 hoverable">free</span> distribution of
electronic <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t7 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">works</span> in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> and cannot survive <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> wide

increasing the <span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span> of public domain and licensed <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t7 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">works</span> that can be
freely distributed in machine readable <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received <span class="t2 t11 t15 t19 t25 t27 hoverable">written</span> confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
<span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a <span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span> of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t7 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">works</span> that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
