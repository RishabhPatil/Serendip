INTRODUCTION

"WHEN the religion formerly received is rent by discords," remarks Bacon in his subtle essay on the "Vicissitudes of Things," "and when the holiness of the professors of religion is decayed and full of scandal, and withal the times be stupid, ignorant, and barbarous, you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> doubt the springing up of a <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> sect; if then <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> there should arise any extravagant and strange <span class="t0 t1 t3 t5 t7 t8 t13 t16 t18 t20 t21 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> himself author thereof.

There be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> manners of plantations of <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> sects: by the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of signs and miracles; by the eloquence and wisdom of speech and persuasion; and by the sword. For martyrdoms, I reckon them amongst miracles, because they seem to exceed the strength of <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> nature; and I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> do the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> of superlative and admirable holiness of life."

So <span class="t6 t9 t18 t26 hoverable">far</span> as his range of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> extended, Bacon's remarks are true. But when we attempt to apply them to the history of Buddhism, we find that they need considerable qualification. Buddhism arose in an age when "the holiness of the professors of religion," the influence of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> hierarchy in India, was "decayed and full of scandal." But the times, <span class="t6 t9 t18 t26 hoverable">far</span> from being "stupid, ignorant, and barbarous," were full of eager intellectual and moral activity; on all sides ancient doctrines were being reaffirmed by their professors and assailed by critics, while <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> systems of <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> were rising everywhere. The Buddha. himself was not an "extravagant and strange spirit," but a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whose</span> <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> in essentials was thoroughly in harmony with the ideas of Hinduism, and <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whose</span> character fulfilled a Hindu ideal. His Church did indeed endeavour to supplant the authority of the Brahmans; but it sought to attain this <span class="t7 t10 t15 t25 hoverable">end</span> <span class="t4 t18 t22 hoverable">neither</span> by "the giving licence to pleasures and a voluptuous life," nor by the sword. Its marvellous success was clue to

[p. 9]

[paragraph continues] "the eloquence and wisdom of speech and persuasion" and to "the superlative and admirable holiness of life" of the Buddha.

About a hundred miles north from Benares, on the border of Nepal, where the plain of the Ganges begins to rise to the uplands at the edge of the mighty Himalayas, lies a little region which was once the home of the S'akyas, a class of Kshatriyas, or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> of the warrior caste. To Suddhodana of Kapila-vastu, a nobleman of the Gautama family of this tribe, was born about 660 B.C. a. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> Siddhartha. When he grew up Siddhartha likewise married and begot a son, Rahula, by name. And then, when he was about twenty-nine <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span> of age, as tradition relates, Siddhartha became weary of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> and the flesh. The ghastly riddle of Life--Life with its endless vicissitudes of phantom pleasure and ever-renewed pain--was ceaselessly pressing itself <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> him, as it has pressed itself <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> so <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> thousands of other Hindus, and he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> find no rest in his father's home. So he left the world, to <span class="t8 t13 hoverable">become</span> a wandering beggar-student, in the hope of finding the key to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> mystery in the teachings of some <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">master</span> of philosophic lore. But none of the teachers whom he met <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> satisfy the hunger of his soul, and the severest mortification of the flesh <span class="t2 t4 t5 t22 t23 hoverable">brought</span> him no light.

There are very few dogmas in the <span class="t3 t5 t7 t9 t20 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> history of philosophy and religion that have been so copiously discussed and so differently interpreted as this. It seems to be an attempt to show how individual existences and consciousnesses arise in the cosmic process. <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">According</span> to Buddhist teaching, there is no permanent "soul" and there is no real "matter." There exists only an infinite number of <span class="t14 hoverable">series</span> of consciousnesses either potentially or actively in operation, and each <span class="t14 hoverable">series</span> consists of a succession of moments of

[p. 14]

consciousness, each moment being the direct resultant of its predecessors. Now the force which directs this process in each <span class="t14 hoverable">series</span> is its karma, or "works," the influence of former activities, mostly in previous births; it is by reason of its former karma that a train of consciousness at a particular moment begins to develop itself into an "individual," that is to say, a consciousness of being a particular person, human, divine, or animal. So we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> interpret the Buddha's formula as a vague expression for the manner in which the individual emerges from the ocean of cosmic being. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">First</span> in <span class="t0 t6 t7 t8 t11 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">order</span> is "ignorance"; that is to say, when we analyse the operation of karma <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> a train of moments of consciousness, we find that its primary effect is to <span class="t1 t3 t9 t15 t20 t21 t26 t29 hoverable">cause</span> ignorance, namely, the false belief held by this consciousness that it is a "self," an ego, and the other consequent delusions. This ignorance, in turn, issues in "conformations," the potentialities of love, hatred, and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> weaknesses of the spirit, which are the resultants of activities in previous individuated existences, and inspire to future activities. Then emerges consciousness of finite being in general, and from this issue "name and form," the conception of a definite <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> of particulars. This leads to the evolution of the sense-organs, and the union of these with the apparent <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> outside them produces sensation, which issues in desire. In its turn desire leads to

[p. 15]

[paragraph continues] "attraction," the attachment to individual life. So finite existence, bhava, is at last reached, and the developed consciousness passes through the stages of birth, disease, sorrow, and finally death. Then the process begins anew under the guidance of the <span class="t25 hoverable">old</span> karma, reinforced by that which has resulted from the process that has just <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> to an end.

This is, in broad outline, the teaching of Buddhism as it is understood by most Buddhists in Ceylon and Further India. In theory it verges <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> nihilistic idealism, for it regards all the data of finite experience as pure subjective phenomena corresponding to no objective reality, and created merely by the force of karma; there is no higher <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Power</span> than man's own will, and his karma to

In practice it is a creed that fosters in its votaries in abundant measure both the homely virtues of laic Life, and the higher <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> aspirations of asceticism; and its ideals are <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t8 t10 t12 t13 t14 t17 t19 t23 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> expressed in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of its best <span class="t6 t10 t15 hoverable">known</span> texts, the Mangala-sutta of the Sutta-nipata:

But an important question arises here. Are the doctrines which we have outlined the original teaching of the Buddha, or do they not rather represent the opinions of the school which formed the Pali Canon some centuries after his death--a monastic fraternity with a strong bent towards rationalism? <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Even</span> in this Canon the teachings ascribed to the <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> are full of logical inconsistencies.

It is, in fact, a theory of "phenomenalism," and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> opened a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> for development in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> directions.

That this movement was antinomian and fraught with danger from the first, is obvious. Its doctrine of <span class="t7 hoverable">love</span> unfettered by considerations of social expediency and ordinary morality, [*1] and the wild luxuriance of its myth, were capable of working harm as <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t8 t10 t12 t13 t14 t17 t19 t23 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> as good, and in practice have often lent themselves to the most disgraceful abuse. But on this dark side of the picture we need not dwell here. It is enough that we should recognise that the Maha-yana, the "Great Vehicle," as the <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> Church proudly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> itself, in opposition to the more primitive Buddhism, which it scornfully styled Hina-yana, the "Little Vehicle," laid especial stress <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the emotional side of religion and ethics, which had been somewhat neglected in the latter school, and that it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> gained a novel character and significance.

In the doctrine of the older schools the <span class="t19 hoverable">Buddha</span> was a teacher <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whose</span> enlightenment raised him above all the gods, hut withal a man, who had passed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">away</span> from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> for ever, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> no more wield any influence <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> it, save as a <span class="t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t12 t15 t19 t20 t23 t25 hoverable">holy</span> and blessed memory.

Lastly, as we have already remarked, salvation was confined to the monastic orders.

The Maha-yana changed almost everything. The <span class="t19 hoverable">Buddha</span> now appeared as a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">god</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> order, invested with all the qualities that the most extravagant mythopoeic imagination <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> suggest. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Like</span> the conception of <span class="t3 t7 t12 t17 t19 t24 t26 hoverable">Christ</span> in the Docetic schools, he was imagined as existing throughout the <span class="t3 t5 t7 t9 t20 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> of the cosmic period, in the "Body of Enjoyment" visible to the beatified Bodhi-sattvas, and the "Body of Magic Form" revealed to common mortals; and he was multiplied to infinity. Imagination created countless periods and countless domains, each under the presidency of a Buddha; and from the beginning of our era we observe that the historical Gautama.

The most conspicuous of these is the <span class="t19 hoverable">Buddha</span> Amitabha, "He of Infinite Light," a being of supreme splendour and grace; for now the Buddhas have <span class="t8 t13 hoverable">become</span> active dispensers of grace, at any rate from the standpoint of relative truth. Each <span class="t19 hoverable">Buddha</span> dwells in his paradise amidst a retinue of Bodhisattvas;

[p. 25]

of the latter the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> <span class="t6 t9 t22 t29 hoverable">highest</span> in rank serve as the ministers of his grace, constantly visiting the worlds under his rule in. the forms most suitable to their purpose, in <span class="t0 t6 t7 t8 t11 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">order</span> to show their <span class="t7 hoverable">love</span> for suffering mortality by helping them in divers ways and leading them to paradise. The paradise of Amitabha is Sukavati, "The Happy Place," a fairyland which is tenanted by an entirely <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> population dwelling in perfect bliss. [*1] Amitabha's chief minister is Avalokites'vara, a Bodhi-sattva who has <span class="t19 hoverable">taken</span> a vow not to enter Nirvana until he has led thither all living creatures, and who for this supreme grace is worshipped throughout the North with a corresponding fervour of devotion. As a last development of this mythology, the Buddhas are associated with Taras, or Saviour-Ladies, who under the <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of sexual antithesis typify their consorts' energy of grace.

The moral standpoint is likewise changed. The ideal is no longer the calm, ascetic monk, waiting in cheerful tranquillity for the end, but the Bodhi-sattva, the self-appointed votary seeking eagerly to procure happiness for his fellow-creatures at any cost, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> if he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> surrender his own. <span class="t27 hoverable">right</span> to <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> advancement as the price.

They are real only from the standpoint, of relative truth. But this condition of imperfect reality is inseparable from humanity; it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> be accepted and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> the basis of a moral activity which by perfect self-sacrifice purifies the <span class="t0 t1 t3 t5 t7 t8 t13 t16 t18 t20 t21 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> from the taint of finite error.

In the case of the Buddhas this transfiguration is, strictly speaking, illusory.

But the merit of their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> deeds still lives on in the finite world, and becomes a force working spontaneously for the happiness and welfare of other creatures.

of their <span class="t19 hoverable">Buddha</span> revealing itself for their joy and instruction in beatific form. [*1]

While this theory of the "Body of Enjoyment" satisfied the hanger of the imagination for visions of paradise, the doctrine of the "Body of Magical Form" attempted to explain the appearance of Buddhas and Bodhi-sattvas in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> of mortality.

And this idea has <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> its metaphysical side.

The real Nagarjuna, the scholar who founded the Madhyamika school, is overshadowed by the legendary Nagarjuna, the hero of a hundred myths in which he figures as a miracle-working saint who propagated his doctrine by the marvels of his magic. These wild legends have passed from Buddhist circles into the common stock of Hindu tradition, where he has <span class="t8 t13 hoverable">become</span> a typical sorcerer, to whom are ascribed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> <span class="t9 t16 t26 hoverable">works</span> on the black art and divination, notably the popular Kaksha-puta.

the intellectual or verbal expression of this wisdom" (Prof. de la Vallee Poussin).

(2) The "Thought of Enlightenment" (Bodhi-chitta) is to the Maha-yana what 'grace' is to Christian theology. Buddhism, in common with the other schools of Indian thought, holds that all living beings are fettered in the beginningless and endless cycle of embodied births, metempsychosis or samsara, in which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> instant of present experience is a resultant of former actions. Only the Buddhas, the loving teachers of salvation to mankind, have risen after aeons of effort in countless births into the transcendental peace of Nirvana. Hence the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> religious duty of the believer is aspiration to <span class="t8 t13 hoverable">become</span> a <span class="t19 hoverable">Buddha</span> for the weal of fellow-creatures. This yearning arises in his heart, by the special grace of the Buddhas, in the <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of the Bodhi-chitta, which is finely expressed by our author in his third chapter. By this vow the believer constitutes himself a Bodhi-sattva, "or creature of enlightenment," of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> stage; he has devoted himself to the acquisition of merit by charity and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> raise him through higher and higher planes of existence, until he reaches the condition of the celestial Bodhi-sattvas, such as Manjughosha and Avalokites'vara, who have attained the <span class="t6 t9 t22 t29 hoverable">highest</span> beatification that the finite universe can give, and are only delaying their departure into the infinite stillness of Nirvana in <span class="t0 t6 t7 t8 t11 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">order</span> to continue their <span class="t9 t16 t26 hoverable">works</span> as loving guides and helpers of mankind towards happiness and <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> sanctification,

(12) These are the celestial Bodhi-sattvas (see notes 1, 2).

(13) "Stillness" is perhaps the mast suitable term to express the idea, of Nirvana; compare Denssen, Allgemeine Geschichte der Philosophie, bd. 1., abteil. 3, pp. 111 f., 152 f., etc. Nirvana does not signify extinction or annihilation, as is commonly imagined in Europe, but the very reverse, perfect <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> self-realisation in transcendental being. The metaphor <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> occurs in the Upanishads, and frequently reappears later in non-Buddhist theology; it denotes moksha, the state in which the individual soul, identifying itself with universal Being, is entirely at rest in itself and in Brahma, in the stillness of infinite thought. The <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> of delusion and earthly desire has <span class="t8 t13 hoverable">become</span> extinguished in it by the annihilation of its feel, the false imagination of finite being. Nirvana is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> similar to the yoga, or ecstasy of the Yogic adept, which is technically defined as chitta-vritti-nirodha, cessation of the activity of the finite imagination, and it is frequently <span class="t27 hoverable">used</span> in the same connection. Nirvana properly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> denote either the blowing-out of a flame, or the burning of a flame undisturbed by wind (compare Bhagavad-gita, vi, 19). The latter interpretation will suit the oldest passages where the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">word</span> occurs; but the former is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> applicable, and is necessary in some of the later passages. Now the Buddhists denied the existence of a soul, or permanent Self. Logically, therefore, they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> not assert the existence of a Nirvana, or transcendental existence of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> or Self; and theoretically, indeed, the Madhyamika

(24) Here comes a polemic against the Sankhya and the Vedanti schools. The former divide existence into primal Matter and individual souls which by connection with the former assume the functions of finite thought. The Vedantis believe in a single universal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> or Brahma, essentially indeterminate, which by the operation of the cosmic Illusion (Maya) differentiates itself into individual finite souls.

(28) The presence of a pravrajuka, an ascetic who bas himself withdrawn from the world, causes us to perform the pravrajya, i.e. to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">take</span> from him the vows of his ascetic <span class="t0 t6 t7 t8 t11 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">order</span> and <span class="t8 t13 hoverable">become</span> a monk in his company.

(20) Living creatures are a "domain" (kshetra) for the acquisition of merit by the aspirants to enlightenment; for merit is gained by showing love, charity, etc., towards them. The Buddhas or "Conquerors" (Jina) are likewise a "domain"; merit is gained by doing service to them. (Cf. <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t9 t12 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">note</span> 7 above.)

(30) Both Buddhas and inferior creatures alike assist the aspirant to win merit and <span class="t8 t13 hoverable">become</span> a <span class="t19 hoverable">Buddha</span> himself. True, the Buddhas are immeasurably <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> and great, and are always consciously beneficent, while other creatures often are in their intention maleficent, But if we measure the worth of a purpose by its results, noting that wrong-doing is a "blessing in disguise" to the sufferer, we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> conclude that the purpose of a Buddha's help is not more valuable to the aspirant than the various motives of other creatures with whom he has dealings.

(33) This is a polemical reference to the Hina-yana school of Buddhism, of which the adepts (S'ravaka) sought enlightenment and Nirvana for themselves and by themselves.

[p. 101]

[paragraph continues] Is not such a course more rapid and sure than that recommended by our author, in which the aspirant to Buddhahood deliberately postpones his Nirvana in <span class="t0 t6 t7 t8 t11 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">order</span> to <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t7 t10 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> for the welfare of the world?
