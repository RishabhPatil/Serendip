And likewise, He saith: "He—glorified be His mention—resembleth the sun.

After We were exiled and had departed from Iraq to Constantinople, however, news of her ceased to reach Us. Subsequent to Our separation in the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">Land</span> of Ta (Tihran), We ceased to meet Mirza Rida-Quli, Our brother, and no special news reached Us concerning her.

After this occurred, We separated from Our brother. He established his residence close to the entrance of Masjid-i-Shah, whilst We lived near the Gate of Shimiran. Thereafter, however, that sister displayed toward Us, for no <span class="t1 t11 t16 t20 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">reason</span> whatever, a hostile attitude. This Wronged One held His peace under all conditions. However, Our late brother Mirza Muhammad-Hasan’s daughter—upon him be the <span class="t3 t22 t28 hoverable">glory</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> and His peace and His mercy --who had been betrothed to the Most <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Great</span> Branch (Abdu’l-Baha) was <span class="t2 t5 t11 t18 t19 t23 t26 hoverable">taken</span> by the sister of this Wronged One from Nur to her own house, and from there sent <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">unto</span> another place. Some of Our companions and friends in various places complained against this, as it was a very grievous act, and was disapproved by all the loved ones of God. How strange that Our sister should have <span class="t2 t5 t11 t18 t19 t23 t26 hoverable">taken</span> her to her own house, and then arranged for her to be sent elsewhere! In spite of this, this Wronged One remained, and still remaineth, calm and silent. A word, however, was said in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">order</span> to tranquilize Our loved ones.

Later on, she threw in her lot with Mirza Yahya. Conflicting reports concerning her are now reaching Us, nor is it clear what she is saying or doing. We beseech God—blessed and glorified be He—to cause her to turn <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">unto</span> Him, and aid her to repent before the door of His grace.
