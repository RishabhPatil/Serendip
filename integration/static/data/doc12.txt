the secret of living water. Distilled from the sea and leaving most of
its burden of salt behind, it droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven,

naturalist, the pioneer of Eco-technology (working with Nature)
who had devoted his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> to demonstrating how the desecration of

that humanity <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> begin, with humility, to study <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Nature</span> and learn

aim was to liberate <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> from dependence on inefficient and polluting centralized energy resources and generation of power.
Viktor was communicating his distress to his son, Walter, on the
plane home from Texas after a nightmare of exhausting crossexamination to extract the secrets of the devices he had developed
which demonstrated free energy, anti-gravity and fuel-less flight.
He died five <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t11 t20 t26 t27 hoverable">days</span> later on September 25,1958, in Linz, Austria, of a
broken heart. <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t28 hoverable">Father</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> had embarked on an ambitious, but

Schauberger had in 1944, under threat of death, been forced
to develop a flying saucer programme for the Third Reich, the secret
weapon which, had it been initiated <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span> earlier, <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t18 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">might</span> <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t8 t10 t12 t13 t14 t17 t19 t23 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span>

Schauberger's inspiration <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> from studying the <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> in fastflowing streams in the unspoilt Austrian Alps, where he worked as a
forest warden. From his astute observations he became a self-trained
engineer, eventually learning, through the implosive, or centripetally
moving, processes that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Nature</span> uses, how to release energy 127 times

developed an implosion motor that produced a thrust of l,290m/sec,
or about four times the speed of sound. In 1941 Air Marshall Udet
asked him to help solve the growing energy crisis in Germany; <span class="t27 t28 hoverable">however</span> the research <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> to an <span class="t7 t10 t15 t25 hoverable">end</span> when Udet died and the plant was

subsequently destroyed by Allied bombing. When in 1943 Heinrich
Himmler directed Viktor to develop a <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> secret weapon system with
a team of engineer prisoners-of-war, he had no choice but to comply.
The critical tests <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> just before the <span class="t7 t10 t15 t25 hoverable">end</span> of the European war. A
flying disc was launched in Prague on February 19,1945, which rose
to an altitude of 15,000 metres in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> minutes and attained a forward speed of 2,200kph.2 An improved version was to be launched on

in Upper Austria. Facing the collapse of the German armies, Field
Marshal Keitel ordered all the prototypes to be destroyed.
Schauberger had moved from his apartment in Vienna to the
comparative safety of Leonstein. Meanwhile the Russians pushed in
from the East and captured Vienna; a special Soviet investigation
team ransacked his apartment, taking <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">away</span> vital papers and models, and then blew it up.
The Allies seemed to be <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t8 t10 t12 t13 t14 t17 t19 t23 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> aware of Schauberger's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> in
developing this secret weapon. At the <span class="t7 t10 t15 t25 hoverable">end</span> of hostilities, an American Special Forces team seized all the equipment from his Leonstein
home and <span class="t0 t2 t16 t18 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">put</span> him under 'protective U.S. custody 'for nine months'
debriefing. It seems likely that they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> not fathom his strange
science, for they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">let</span> him go, although this group, detailed to enlist as

industrial and military research. They forbade him from pursuing
'atomic energy' research, which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have left him free to follow
his dream of fuel-less power.

advanced equipment were beyond his means, and he had no sponsors. In addition, he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> have been haunted by remorse for having
been forced by the German SS to design machines of war.
Schauberger was essentially a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> of peace who, above all, wanted to

It was spawning <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> early spring moonlit night. I was
sitting beside a waterfall waiting to catch a dangerous fish
poacher. Something then happened so quickly; I was hardly
able to grasp it. The moonlight falling onto the crystal clear

gathered in the pool. Suddenly they dispersed as a big fish
swam into the pool from below, preparing to confront the
waterfall. It seemed as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> it wanted to scatter the other

Then, just as suddenly the large trout disappeared into the
huge jet of falling <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> that shone <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> molten metal.

dancing in a wild, spinning movement, which at that moment
didn't <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> sense to me. When it stopped spinning it seemed
then to float motionlessly upward. On reaching the lower
curve of the waterfall it tumbled over and with a strong push
reached behind the upper curve of the fall. There, in the fast
flowing water, and with a strong movement of the tail, it
disappeared.
Deep in thought, I filled my pipe, and as I wended my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span>
homewards, smoked it to the finish. Often subsequently, I
witnessed the same sequence of behaviour of a trout leaping

INTRODUCTION

Viktor <span class="t27 hoverable">used</span> to spend hours watching fish in the streams. He was fascinated by how the trout <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> lie motionless in the strongest current
and then, if alarmed, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> warning, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> dart upstream rather
than be carried down with the flow. Having learned from his family
about the importance of temperature on the energy potential of
water, he did an experiment. He had colleagues heat up 100 litres of
<span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> that, on his signal, they poured into the fast-flowing mountain
stream some 150 metres upstream from where he stood. Viktor
noted how the trout he had been observing became agitated, and
soon was unable to hold its station in the fast flowing stream, thrashing its tail fins to no avail. The minute, but nevertheless abnormal,
rise in the average temperature of the <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> and the chaoticized flow
that resulted, had interfered with the trout's hovering ability. Viktor
searched the textbooks in vain for an explanation of this marvel.
He <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> often quote these experiences with the trout as having
the most influence on developing his ideas, for temperature and
motion were the foundations of his theories and discoveries. He
subsequently developed a generator to produce energy directly
from air and water, naming it the 'trout turbine' in honour of his
mentor, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> it was later <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the 'implosion machine.'

The non-conformist
Viktor Schauberger was discredited and criticized by 'the experts,'
as pioneers have been in the past, from Galileo to Max Planck. He
insisted that we have betrayed our calling and our heritage, by
usurping the role of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> and trashing our environment. He saw that
we were hell-bent on a path of self-destruction, and predicted that,
<span class="t5 t7 hoverable">within</span> a generation, our climate <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> <span class="t8 t13 hoverable">become</span> more hostile, our
food sources <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> dry up, there <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be no healthy water, and illness, misery and violence <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> predominate.
Where have conventional scientists gone astray? By not observing carefully how <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Nature</span> works. If they did, they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be able to
formulate her laws, as Schauberger has done, and then comply with
them, so that <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> society <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> into harmony with our
environment. As he so often said, 'Comprehend and Copy Nature.'
Instead, modern scientists believe we are above <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Nature</span> and are free
to exploit the Earth's resources <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> consequence.
Schauberger spelled out clearly exactly where we have gone
wrong with our technology. How can we start to <span class="t0 t2 t16 t18 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">put</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> right?
HIDDEN <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">NATURE</span>

Certainly by a complete reversal of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> we do things. This can
involve only a sea change in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> we regard our lives, and a personal commitment to help <span class="t22 hoverable">bring</span> about a major shift in our society.
Only through sufficient numbers joining <span class="t16 t21 hoverable">together</span> in common <span class="t1 t3 t9 t15 t20 t21 t26 t29 hoverable">cause</span>
can these changes begin.
He criticized mainline science for its arrogance and herd
instincts. He <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> castigated scientists for their blinkeredness, their
inability to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> the connections between things. Schauberger did
not blame the political hierarchy for the world's woes, as we often do
today. He believed that political leaders are basically opportunists
and pawns of the system. It was his own adversaries, the 'technoacademic' scientists as he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> them, whom he held to blame for
the dangerous state of the World.4
Visionaries and pioneers are inevitably a challenge to the establishment in whatever field, for they pose an imagined threat to the
interests of those who benefit from the status quo. The degree of vilification seems to depend on the level of rewards at stake. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> science, as perhaps the most exclusive and arrogant of disciplines, has
done so <span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">much</span> throughout history to undermine <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> innovators

pioneers James Lovelock, Rupert Sheldrake and Mae-Wan Ho.
Despite, or perhaps because of, his interrupted education, Viktor
retained a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> thirst for knowledge. His wife <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> domestically
disruptive his tendency to stay up all night, pouring over books of

that often he seemed to write in a trance-like state, returning to normal consciousness quite surprised by what he had just written!
Schauberger was a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> of unshakeable self-confidence and
inner conviction about the viability of his theories, and unsurprisingly had a lifelong battle with orthodoxy. Callum Coats describes
how on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> occasion during the Nazi era, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> fortune saved his

important support. This was inevitably from the few scientists
who were not swayed by greed or jealousy and were of more independent mind. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">One</span> was the Swiss Professor Werner Zimmerman,

Most <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> have heard of Viktor Schauberger only in connection with his inspired ideas about <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> or of the energy-saving

lively water. They were, indeed, so fundamental and important as to
justify his reputation as an ecological pioneer. However, as we are
concerned with the broader challenge of restoring the damage
wrought by humanity on the Earth, we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> need to present
Schauberger's larger worldview of how <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Nature</span> works.
Walter Schauberger, who unlike his father, had a formal education in science and was, for a time, a university lecturer in physics,
worked hard to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> Viktor's ideas more accessible to mainstream
science. After he did a lecture tour in 1950 at a number of England's
top universities, some of the distinguished scientists were asked
what they <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> of the Schauberger physics. While they agreed
that the theories were quite convincing, the problem, it appeared,
was that 'it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> mean rewriting all the textbooks in the world.'6

An alternative worldview
Viktor Schauberger suffered <span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">much</span> from the vindictiveness of the
scientific establishment towards him. Nevertheless, his constant
complaints about them obscure his principal message, which is <span class="t6 t9 t18 t26 hoverable">far</span>
more important than academic arrogance per se. This is that our
<span class="t3 t5 t7 t9 t20 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> culture is completely under the thrall of a materialistic
worldview or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> of seeing; we are caught in the excitement of
apparently being free to do anything we want, and by the glamour
of possessing lots of riches and distractions. Our science is but the
product of this worldview, as is our philosophy and education, our
religion, our politics and our medicine. You don't need to subscribe
to conspiracy theories to realize that all aspects of our society suffer from a grand delusion that is contributing to the breakdown of
our <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> <span class="t0 t6 t7 t8 t11 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">order</span> and to the collapse of our ecosystems.
The real issue is that the intellectual movement of the late seventeenth century, the Enlightenment, and its equivalent in science,
Rationalism, have caused a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> schism in <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> society. The
philosopher Rene Descartes (famous for his 'I think <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> I am')

begin to relate our experiences to a <span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">much</span> wider and more exciting
worldview. Rachel Carson, who is credited with having initiated the
environmental movement with her <span class="t25 hoverable">book</span> Silent Spring, was a brave
woman for taking on the multinational corporations. Schauberger is
all the braver for taking on our conventional worldview.

Have Viktor's warnings been vindicated? It is over 45 <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span> since his

slowly. Recognition of the critical imbalances we have created in our

INTRODUCTION

We feel that Schauberger's perceptions are a vital key to understanding where our culture has gone wrong and that our future as a
species depends on being able to reconnect with the natural
processes he rediscovered. We shall, therefore, <span class="t22 hoverable">bring</span> into twenty-first
century relevance his views of how <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Nature</span> <span class="t9 t16 t26 hoverable">works</span> and where our
society has gone wrong, to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> what we can learn from his insights.
Viktor has a singular <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> of deprecating our culture, as the following comment on our conditioning reveals:
Humanity has <span class="t8 t13 hoverable">become</span> accustomed to relate everything to itself
(anthropocentrism). In the process we have failed to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> that
real <span class="t3 t7 t9 t10 t15 t19 t22 hoverable">truth</span> is a slippery thing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> which the perpetually reformulating <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> passes judgment almost imperceptibly. In the
main all that is then left behind is whatever was drilled into
our brain with <span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">much</span> trouble and effort, and to which we cling.
To <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> rein to free thought, to allow our minds to flow freely
and unimpeded, is too fraught with complications. For this reason the activity arising from these notions inevitably becomes
a traffic in excreta that stinks to high heaven, because its foundations were already decayed and rotten from the very beginning. It is no wonder, therefore, that everywhere everything is
going wrong. <span class="t3 t7 t9 t10 t15 t19 t22 hoverable">Truth</span> resides only in all-knowing Nature.7
Schauberger predicted that modern <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> culture's destruction of

depravity in society. If we were to pay heed to what <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Nature</span> requires

and a gradual coming back into balance of a <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> society that

But as in our hubris we believe we are at the peak of material

to be manipulated and exploited for the imagined benefit of
humanity. Accountability is apparently not an issue.
The national debate on GM held in Britain in 2003 showed that
most <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> are deeply disturbed by the arrogance of the view that

But they have no science to turn to for rebuttal. What is needed is a Science of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Nature</span> to
supplant the misguided science presently taught in our schools and
universities. We need to <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t7 t10 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> with a holistic view of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Nature</span> as

What are these laws of Nature? How are we to <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">know</span> what is our
place, and what is demanded of us? Viktor Schauberger excelled as
a teacher of the science of Nature. He describes and illustrates, as
few have done, how <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Nature</span> works, with its marvellous and complex

Viktor Schauberger is <span class="t6 t10 t15 hoverable">known</span> at present only to a small, holistically-inclined audience that has a strong commitment to environmental issues, to organic growing or to the development of
alternative energy sources. <span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">Much</span> of the literature on Schauberger is
sometimes difficult to follow for the less committed. This <span class="t25 hoverable">book</span>
draws on Callum Coats' seminal <span class="t25 hoverable">book</span> on Viktor's work, Living Energies. We hope that the less technical approach of our <span class="t25 hoverable">book</span> will facilitate for a broader audience how indispensable are Schauberger's
insights if we wish to understand our present ecological predicament.

1. Viktor Schauberger's Vision
Our natural <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> is essentially an indivisible unity, but we <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span>
beings are condemned to apprehend it from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> <span class="t1 t2 t18 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">different</span> directions
— through our senses (perception) or through our minds (conceptual). A child just observes and marvels, but as our rational minds
<span class="t8 t13 hoverable">become</span> trained we are taught to interpret what we see, usually
through other people's ideas, in <span class="t0 t6 t7 t8 t11 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">order</span> to 'make sense' of our sensory
experience. Both are forms of reality, but unless we are able to <span class="t22 hoverable">bring</span>
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> aspects meaningfully together, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> will present <span class="t15 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">nothing</span> but incomprehensible riddles to us. This, in fact, is the basic
shortcoming of our present <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> society. It is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> weakness
of the prevailing scientific orthodoxy. As Schauberger noted:
The majority believes that everything hard to comprehend
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> be very profound. This is incorrect. What is hard to
understand is what is immature, unclear and often false. The
<span class="t6 t9 t22 t29 hoverable">highest</span> wisdom is simple and passes through the brain

Some of the pioneers of science were able to bridge this dichotomy.
Their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> was to immerse themselves so deeply in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> of pure
observation and experience, that out of these perceptions the concepts <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> speak for themselves.
Viktor Schauberger (1885-1958) possessed this rare gift. As a
result of this, more than anyone else of his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> he foresaw, as early
as the 1920s, the environmental crises in which we are now
engulfed. Viktor's forebears had a <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> tradition of caring for the
welfare of the natural forest and its wildlife in the Austrian Alps.
Although he was born into a family that cherished unspoilt Nature,
Viktor, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> most pioneers, was the rebel amongst them.

His father, nicknamed after the legendary giant 'Ruebesahl,' as
he was 6' 8" tall, did not relate <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t8 t10 t12 t13 t14 t17 t19 t23 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> to the young Viktor. He resented
the young <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> rejecting his paternal advice to improve himself
with a modern academic training. His brothers acquiesced with
their father. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> to whom Viktor remained closest was his

and more so under a full Moon.
Viktor was a dreamy child, but was endowed with an extraordinary quality of observation, a keen intellect, and evident intuitive and
psychic abilities. As a boy he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> spend hours by himself in the
forests, exploring streams, watching the animals and studying the
plants. He was able to experience <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t29 hoverable">hand</span> what he had <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> heard

creatures. He had no interest in the academic path and declined the
opportunity to go to forestry college. He did some more practical
training instead, and served an apprenticeship under an older forest
warden. Married young, Viktor moved to a post in a virgin forest 93
miles (150 km) south into the mountains. Four weeks after his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span>
was born, Viktor was drafted in 1914 into the Kaiser's army.
After the war he quickly rose from junior forest warden to gamekeeper and became the head warden of the forest and hunting
domain in Brunnenthal/Steyerling owned by Prince Adolf zu
Schaumburg-Lippe. In this large wilderness area, almost untouched
by man, Schauberger was able to study how <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Nature</span> <span class="t9 t16 t26 hoverable">works</span> when left

Schauberger ordered it to be pulled down for safety reasons.
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">One</span> of the older foresters then warned him that if the structure were

later, he noted that the spring had indeed dried up due to exposure
to the Sun's rays. Immediately he ordered the structure to be carefully rebuilt and a few <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t11 t20 t26 t27 hoverable">days</span> later the spring began to flow again. This
taught him that <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> liked to flow in cool darkness.

Viktor's abiding interest was to discover how to generate energy
using Nature's own methods. He worked out how a trout is able to
screw its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> up a waterfall by hitching a ride on strong levitative
currents, and using this principle, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> generator he developed
was the 'trout turbine.' To perfect this he needed more precise information on how a trout is able to stand motionless in a fast moving
current, and indeed how it can suddenly accelerate upstream. The
above diagram illustrates this amazing phenomenon (Fig. 1.1).
The trout is holding its station in mid steam where the <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> is
coldest, densest and has most potential energy. Viktor studied the
gills of the fish and <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> what he <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> were guide vanes which
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> direct the <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> flow into a powerful backwards vortex current. Its shiny scales minimize friction with the water, but they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span>
create scores more of little vortices that amplify the upstream
counter current, particularly towards the tail, which cancel out the
pressure on the fish's snout. A zone of negative thrust is created
along the <span class="t3 t5 t7 t9 t20 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> of the trout's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> and so it stays in the same place.
These counter currents can be increased by flicks of the tail, creating negative pressure behind the fish. Flapping of the gills amplifies
the vortices along its flanks, giving it a sudden push upstream. The

The trout normally swims in the middle of the
central current, where the <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> is densest and

accelerate. As their critical velocities are exceeded,
vortices or countercurrents are formed along the
rear <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of the trout's body, providing a
counterthmst to the current, allowing the trout to
remain stationary in the fast flowing water. If it
needs to accelerate, it flaps its gills, creating a
further vortex train along its flanks, increasing the
counterthmst upstream.

faster the gills move the more oxygen-deficient <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> is expelled
from the body. This combining with the free oxygen in the water,
causes the <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> to expand, with an effect on the fish similar
to squeezing a bar of wet soap in your hand.

growth in understanding, occurred when he had shot a chamois buck
on a frosty night under the full Moon. The buck fell into a ravine and,
attempting to retrieve it, Schauberger fell down a snow chute to the
bottom. In the bright <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> of the Moon, he became aware of movement in the stream below where he stood. Some green logs were bobbing up on the surface, then sinking to the bottom, as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> they
were dancing. And not only that, but a large stone began to gyrate at
the bottom, and then <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> to the surface, where it was immediately
surrounded by a halo of ice. Other stones <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> surfaced, and he saw
that they were all egg-shaped. It seemed that no uneven or ragged
stones <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> float in this way. Schauberger developed his ideas of <span class="t1 t2 t18 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">different</span> forms of motion and shapes from these observations.
Having seen how <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> carry its greatest load on a cold,

winter of 1918, the town of Linz was suffering a severe shortage of
fuel as a result of the war when the draft animals had been commandeered. There was a small stream that ran through narrow
gorges and which was considered unsuitable for transporting logs,
but he wanted to try out his ideas using this stream. His offer to help
being accepted by the authorities, he describes how he proceeded:
I had observed that an increased <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> level after a thaw

waited for an increase in the strength of the <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> current.
This takes <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> in the early hours of the morning, when it is
coldest, and particularly at full Moon, although the volume of
the <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> is apparently less due to its compression on cooling.
I planned for the timber to be <span class="t0 t2 t16 t18 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">put</span> in the stream under these
conditions, and in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> night 1600m3 were <span class="t2 t4 t5 t22 t23 hoverable">brought</span> down to

enabled him to turn upside down the current theories of hydraulics,

enormous damage, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> being <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> only for firewood.
The Prince offered a prize for the construction of a flume to <span class="t22 hoverable">bring</span>
logs down from the remote areas, and Viktor eagerly submitted his
plans. These were, however, rejected by the administrators of the estate
as totally unworkable, as the proposed method <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> completely
against accepted hydraulic principles. Through a chance meeting on a
hunting expedition, the Princess asked Viktor what savings <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> be
achieved through his method. On claiming that he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> offer a cost of

for flotation, she offered to have his salary trebled should he succeed,
despite his lack of academic qualifications. The Prince, driving a hard
bargain, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> a condition that Viktor should build the flume at his
own expense and that it had to deliver a minimum of 1,000m3 daily.
There was <span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">much</span> scoffing by the experts who judged
Schauberger completely mad, and who <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> malicious predictions
of the outcome; as Viktor describes:
The construction was completed after some four months. The
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> timbers were in position. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> before the inauguration
I tried a test. An average sized log was <span class="t0 t2 t16 t18 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">put</span> into the flume. It
floated down for about 100 metres and then suddenly
grounded on the bottom, causing the <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> behind to rise and
overflow the flume. I saw the scornful faces of my workers,
realized that I had miscalculated and felt discouraged. The log

was <span class="t19 hoverable">taken</span> out of the flume. I <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> that there was too little
<span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> and too sharp a drop. I did not <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">know</span> what to do. So I sent
my workers home so that I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> quietly consider the problem.
The curves of the flume were correct; of that there was no
doubt. So what had gone wrong? I walked slowly along the
flume until I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> to the trap and the sorting basins, from
which a further length of flume continued. The basins were
full. I sat on a rock above the <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> in the Sun.
Suddenly I felt something moving below my leather
trousers. Jumping up I saw a coiled snake. I picked it up and
threw it away; it fell into the basin and tried to get out, but the
bank was too steep. As it swam back and <span class="t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t9 t10 t11 t13 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">forth</span> I was amazed
that it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> swim so fast <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> fins. Observing it through
my binoculars I saw its peculiar twisting movements in the
clear water. Finally the snake reached the <span class="t6 t9 t18 t26 hoverable">far</span> bank. For some
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> I stood quietly and <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> over in my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> the snake's
bodily movements of horizontal and vertical curves. Suddenly
I understood how it had done it!
The snake's movement was that of a spiral space-curve twisting <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span>
the horn of a Kudu antelope. Calling back his workers, he ordered
the holding basin to be emptied and the log removed. He then gave
instructions to attach thin wooden slats to the curved sides of the
flume walls, which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> act <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> the rifling in a gun barrel, and

through the night, and the adjustments were completed in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> for
the opening in the morning.
The inauguration of the flume was attended by the Prince and
Princess, by the Chief Forestry Commissioner and a number of
hydraulic specialists, the last ready to gloat over Viktor's humiliation.
After greeting the royal couple and the head forester, he continued:
I opened the lock, behind which my workers started to
arrange the smaller logs in the water. Unnoticed, a heavier log
about 3ft (90cm) in diameter <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> in with the others. The

quick wave and the unwanted log floated high, towards the
outflow. Quickly it created a blockage that raised the <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span>

water, waiting for the flume to overflow. Suddenly there was a
gurgling noise. The heavy log swung <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> to the right, then to

quickly. A few seconds later the log slipped through the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span>

Schauberger's flumes followed the curves of the valley, with guide
vanes mounted on the curves, making the <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> spiral along its

float logs under conditions regarded as impossible, using significantly less water, and achieving very high delivery rates. Parts of his
flumes can still be seen in Austria today.
The flume at Steyrling was a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> success, <span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">much</span> to the chagrin

appointed State Consultant for Timber Flotation at a high salary.
The academics were furious that he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> directives on technical questions which he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> not understand with his inadequate
education, and that he was paid twice as <span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">much</span> as any of them. In
the crisis that followed, Viktor resigned, and accepted a job with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span>

seminal paper that Schauberger wrote on 'Temperature and the
Movement of Water.'2 Central to these was the influence of minute
differences in temperature, which are presently wholly ignored by
modern hydraulics and hydrology. Natural, living, water, which is
conventionally regarded as a homogenous substance, he showed to
be composed of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> strata or layers with subtle variations in temperature and electric charge which influence the water's motion, its

water), it is the indispensable constituent of all life-forms, and its quality and temperature is fundamental to health. When it is healthy it has

Our technology's mode of motion creates chaos, noise and heat, bringing disease to organisms and the breakdown of structures. Visualize if you
will, what happens in an explosion — matter is torn apart, fragmented and destroyed. Its effect is to create degraded energy.
Through its dependence on the decomposing mode of motion our
technology creates enormous energy pollution and entropy, dangerously affecting the vital biodiversity and balance of our ecosystems.
Our mechanical, technological systems of motion are nearly all

By contrast, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Nature</span> uses the opposite, centripetal, vortical <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of motion, moving from the outside to the inside with
increasing velocity, which acts to cool, to condense, to structure,
assisting the emergence of higher quality and more complex systems.
Spirals are a basic <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of motion in Nature, but Schauberger's
recognition of the vortex (see p. 42) as the principal creative movement system in the Universe is at the core of his Eco-technology and
the key to his valuable implosion research. From the tornado to
plant growth, it is Nature's mechanism for transforming energy
from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> level to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">another</span> (Fig. 1.2).
Asked about our technology 'How else should it be done?' Viktor's
answer was: 'Exactly in the opposite <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> that it is done today.' He saw
that the potential for creating energy for <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> needs by replicating

temperature in Nature's processes. Modern technology creates vast
amounts of waste heat (entropy) which contribute to global warming, especially in cities and industrial centres (carbon dioxide from
burning fossil fuels being the principal source of global warming).
Increasing heat will ultimately destroy <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> on Earth. Nature's creativity, however, thrives on measured coolness.
Most significantly, he showed how small variations in temperature are as crucial to the healthy movement of <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> and sap as they

and has the greatest vitality, health and energy content.
In all forms of water, in trees and other living organisms, the
temperature gradient (the upward and downward movement of
temperature) is active. In the natural process of synthesis and
decomposition, the temperature is either approaching (positive gradient) or moving <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">away</span> from (negative gradient) the anomaly point.

Evolution
Viktor Schauberger recognized that Nature's evolutionary purpose
is to facilitate the emergence of higher <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> forms, to promote greater
HIDDEN <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">NATURE</span>

complexity of interrelationships and to raise the level of consciousness of the higher <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> forms, all a consequence of the continual
refinement of energies.
Viktor showed that highly ordered systems lose their stability
when their environment suffers deterioration. He predicted that a
decrease of biodiversity in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Nature</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> <span class="t22 hoverable">bring</span> an increase in violence
and a degeneration of <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> qualities in the <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> community.
We think of evolution in terms of technological development.
But if <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> aspect of potentiality is developed at the expense of the
others, you <span class="t7 t10 t15 t25 hoverable">end</span> up with an unbalanced person, or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> with a monster. This is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of the most important lessons our culture has to
learn. It <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t18 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">might</span> <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t8 t10 t12 t13 t14 t17 t19 t23 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> apply to the unregulated biotechnology industry. What level of crisis will be required to force us to rethink our
priorities and change direction?

Balance
Perhaps the most important of Schauberger's insights that we have
to heed is the importance of balance in Nature. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of some
attribute of an organism, its wholeness or unity is composed of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span>
seemingly opposed qualities in resonant balance. Thus, for example, both egoism and altruism are necessary as <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> qualities, but
for evolution to proceed, altruism <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> be more in the ascendant.
Because our culture has emphasized the coarser qualities, our creative evolution has been arrested, and we have attracted the darker
energies of degeneration, with increasing disorder and violence as
the outcome.
All the qualities <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Nature</span> have a coarser physical aspect
that our worldview attracts, to the discouragement of higher, more
subtle energies; we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> be looking at how this impinges on the
environment as a whole. In this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> Nature's balance is upset, the
most obvious being the supremacy today of the more aggressive
energies of humankind.

Implosion
Nature's methods of producing energy are silent, but inherently <span class="t6 t9 t18 t26 hoverable">far</span>
more effective and powerful than our mechanical techniques, as
Schauberger was to prove with his implosion machines that produced prodigious amounts of power. The difference between the
1. VIKTOR SCHAUBERGER'S VISION

two forms of energy production is fundamental to the quality of any
process in our world.
Not only does this implosion technology produce <span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">much</span> more
energy than the 'explosive' methods currently employed, but it creates no waste, pollution, global warming or other damage to Earth's
fragile ecosystems. Schauberger invented a number of 'over-unity'
machines that produced a substantial excess of <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> over input.
These included <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t14 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">means</span> of propulsion for aircraft, submarines, and
cars; <span class="t1 t2 t18 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">different</span> devices that produced power, coolness or heat for the
home, and invaluable machines for making high quality springwater from polluted water. Unfortunately the working models were
destroyed at the <span class="t7 t10 t15 t25 hoverable">end</span> of the <span class="t6 hoverable">Second</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">World</span> War, and his detailed
drawings are missing.
His descriptions of these appliances have inspired a number of
inventors searching for 'free energy' generation. It seems that noone has quite succeeded in replicating <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of Viktor's, but there are
some promising devices ready to go into production. The main
obstacles to their introduction include personal harassment from
agents of the energy 'establishment,' the lack of imagination by
politicians and investors, and the vested interests of the fossil fuel
industries, <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whose</span> lobbying of government is bent on delaying as

home, as Schauberger envisaged.

The visionary
What we have to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">take</span> on board, as it were, is the extent to which the
degraded energies of our present technologies are polluting the
world, both from excess heat, but more particularly because they
not only block or impede the natural productive and healing energies, but actually encourage degeneration. We can reduce global
warming by significant reductions in CO2 emissions. But we <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">cannot</span>
hope for the long-term survival of humanity <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> ditching our
current technology models for those that are wholeheartedly

ecotechnologies are being introduced into the fragile Himalayan

1. VIKTOR SCHAUBERGER'S VISION

2. <span class="t1 t2 t18 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">Different</span> Kinds of Energy
Subtle energies
In the last 200 years, the application of increasingly complex technologies has accelerated enormously, overwhelming the <span class="t6 t9 t18 t26 hoverable">far</span> more
subtle energy systems of Nature, with dire consequences for us all.
For while some will argue that these have <span class="t2 t4 t5 t22 t23 hoverable">brought</span> benefits to
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> on the material level, the quality of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> on the planet has
seriously deteriorated, with severe damage to ecosystems and to
biodiversity.
No <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> explains, as convincingly as Schauberger, just how this
has <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> about. He <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> that the energy our technology propagates is destructive of the evolutionary impulse in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> forms, precipitating a downward spiral in the quality of organisms, and in the
<span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> quality of life. Imagine trying to be creative in a steel mill
or a slaughterhouse! The pride we hold for our Machiavellian
machines that pour out incessant noise and heat is based on the
mistaken belief that we represent the summit of evolution.
Schauberger pointed out that, besides having the ego-centred
need to control, modern science sees only the surface of things.1 Its
reductionist (everything in separate compartments) and materialistic agenda prevents an understanding of the energetic processes
which, as Schauberger demonstrated, are essential for any material
substance to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> into being; in the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> that an idea or
impulse <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> precede any <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> action. These subtle energies are
essential to the increasing quality <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Nature</span> demands in her evolutionary process. When these are subdued, only deterioration can
result, which inevitably <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> affects <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> aspirations. So energy
is cause, <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> is effect. An understanding of any creative process is
impossible <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> awareness of subtle energies.

Schauberger's worldview
Viktor Schauberger <span class="t4 hoverable">took</span> the ancients' view of the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t14 t23 t25 t28 hoverable">Sun</span> as the male
inseminator of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Earth</span> to create bountiful Nature.

Goethe's eighteenth century view, he conceived of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> as a kind of
'Divine Weaver' of the unfolding tapestry of Evolution. It was
through this vision that Viktor <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> common ground <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> with the

However, he saw the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Earth</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Nature</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of a <span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">much</span>
larger cosmos. The visible <span class="t0 t8 t11 t14 t23 t25 t28 hoverable">Sun</span> is but the kernel, the only visible
part, of a <span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">much</span> larger <span class="t0 t8 t11 t14 t23 t25 t28 hoverable">sun</span> that, with its radiative body, stretches to
the very limits of the solar system. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Earth</span> is <span class="t5 t7 hoverable">within</span> this sun,
bathed by the solar wind, spiraling with its sister planets <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> organs
<span class="t5 t7 hoverable">within</span> the same body. Our own bodies too are but kernels of a <span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">much</span>
broader, invisible <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">self</span> that extends around us, and with which we
can feel another's energy.
He was influenced by Theosophical thinking that conceives
the Universe as a holistic system, and criticized contemporary
thinking that <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">cannot</span> accept our subservience to Nature; he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span>
that this limitation of awareness prevents us accepting our <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span>
in the Universe, of which the consciousness we call <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Nature</span> is a
part. This holistic view of all <span class="t14 hoverable">creation</span> is aided by the idea of a
hierarchy of energies, from the very finest that are inconceivable
to humans, down to the coarse, material energies which dominate
contemporary society. Schauberger <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> refer to these <span class="t1 t2 t18 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">different</span>
levels as 'octaves,' but we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> describe them as 'dimensions' or
domains.

Why the mystery?
His scientific contemporaries misunderstood Viktor Schauberger
because his frame of reference was the subtle energies in Nature,
and they hadn't a clue what he was on about. His heightened sensitivities enabled him to be aware of phenomena more subtle than
most of us are able to perceive. As this was his modus operandi, we
need to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">take</span> a look at this <span class="t3 t5 t7 t9 t20 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> question of energies.
Firstly, we need to accept that the worldview of our contemporary culture is that of the material world; that is its reference
point. We don't learn about energies at school or at college, other
than the purely mechanical or electrical. Any phenomenon that is
nonmaterial poses a difficulty for conventional science, for it <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">cannot</span> be described in a manner that is familiar to its discipline.
Thoughts and emotions are energies we all experience, but how

do we study them in the laboratory, other than their physical
effects?
The various forms of effective energy medicine such as
acupuncture, homeopathy, cranial osteopathy (and others) are not
understood by orthodox medicine and, for that reason, are generally dismissed and usually opposed. It is not sufficient to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> that

To correct bioenergetic imbalances or

treatment still widely <span class="t27 hoverable">used</span> in China and now <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> Western

the mechanistic view of life, the physical sciences are undergoing a
revolution. The study of sub-atomic phenomena has led to the
development of quantum physics, in which the environment
becomes unpredictable. The boundaries between energy and matter <span class="t8 t13 hoverable">become</span> blurred, so that the smallest constituents of matter —
particles and electrons — are interchangeable. Matter becomes

As there is nowhere intellectually respectable to slot in these

alternative science, which pushes the boundaries of what is worthy

connected with movement?
When we look up at the fluffy clouds on a summer's day, we

It's a question of density. Our entire universe forms in the same
way.
A material object consists of billions of atoms, each composed
of sub-atomic particles, each of which is a vortex of energy.

its compactness. In its solid state, as ice, its atomic particles move
the most slowly. As the ice melts, they move faster, need more space
to gyrate or vibrate, creating the less dense form, liquid water.
Heated up, the particles accelerate, requiring more space, and
<span class="t8 t13 hoverable">become</span> steam or the invisible gas, <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> vapour. Their state and

The forms create an illusion of being solid and static, caused by

The vortex as the key to creative evolution
The vortex is a window between <span class="t1 t2 t18 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">different</span> qualities or levels of
energy. Black Holes can be <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> of as vortices linking <span class="t1 t2 t18 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">different</span> parts of our universe or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> <span class="t1 t2 t18 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">different</span> universes.

and spiral became hallmarks for Viktor Schauberger, as for him
they were the key to all creative movement. As we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> demonstrate later, the vortex is most clearly seen with water, which it
uses to purify and energize itself, introducing finer energies to
wipe clean the bad energies of the water's previous memory of
misuse.

and unwelcoming. Once sunlight and fresh air are allowed to penetrate, the unpleasant atmosphere is quickly transformed. It is a
natural <span class="t0 t8 t12 t15 t19 t23 t25 hoverable">law</span> that the more refined energy always prevails over the
coarser.3 As Viktor Schauberger demonstrated, Nature's evolutionary imperative is continually to refine and to create greater
complexity and diversity, the vortex being the key process in this
endeavour.

Energies as creative process
We normally think of energy as the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> to do work, as to be able
to run across a busy street. But <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> energy. For the
human, creativity is dependent on thought. Between having an idea
and our wish to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> it fulfilled lies a complex creative process.
If I want to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> an apple pie, there is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> the idea, then the
planning, translating this through visualization and then finally
the physical <span class="t14 hoverable">creation</span> of the pie. This is <span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">much</span> more important
than we realize. From the simplest task <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> tying your shoelace,
to the complex challenge of becoming a tennis champion, the better the 'mind pictures' of how we are going to perform the
required actions, the more successful will be the outcome. The
force, the impulse, which is the motivator for us to create, is an
unseen energetic process.
Viktor Schauberger shows us that we need to think of energy in
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Nature</span> as the potential for creation, not as a mechanical working

extracted for our own greed, rather than a creative system that has
a purpose.
Productive energies <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> it possible for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> forms to arise that

clearest modern examples of a more 'normal' worldview are the
Buddhist beliefs, the Celtic, and those of the indigenous peoples
worldwide who share the idea that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Great</span> <span class="t0 t1 t3 t5 t7 t8 t13 t16 t18 t20 t21 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">Spirit</span> (or God) inspires

In our detachment from the complete or 'real' world, we assume
that it is normal to divide <span class="t1 t2 t18 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">different</span> 'bits' of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> into separate
compartments or 'disciplines.' In fact it is quite abnormal. For traditional peoples, there are no barriers between cosmology, science
and the spiritual, for in the interconnectedness of all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Nature</span> there is

Our physical spacetime dimension contains that spectrum of
energy that vibrates at a rate low enough to support material form.
This Third Dimension or domain has length, breadth and height,
but it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> has the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> components by which humans <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be conscious. These are: the physical, neutral energy through which the
material <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> exists; the emotional, negative energy by which we
receive sensory information; and the mental, positive energy by
which we project our beliefs and personalities into the world. (NB:
The terms negative and positive are <span class="t27 hoverable">used</span> not in a qualitative sense,
but more in the electrical sense of polarity.)
Our daily lives demonstrate the differences between these energies. The mental is the most changeable; it is harder to change our
feelings, and the dense, physical <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> is almost impossible to
change. If we move into a lower dimension, we lose <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> aspect of
consciousness, and if we move higher, we gain one. Moving from the
third to the <span class="t6 hoverable">second</span> dimension, we lose the ability to generate original thought. Moving from the third to the fourth, we add the ability
to mould time.4
In terms of the pure physicality of our three-dimensional world,
our consciousness places and senses each lower dimension as being
external to the body, although, paradoxically, it is both <span class="t5 t7 hoverable">within</span> and
without, and permeated by the higher <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> (see Fig. 2.1, next page).5

Each dimension has a 'veil' at its upper limit
which renders higher levels inaccessible. To a
lesser extent someone of a 'lower' state of
consciousness <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be unaware of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">another</span> in a

that Viktor Schauberger had the ability to tap into this reservoir of
inspiration. All subtle dimensions are present on Earth, interpenetrating the third dimension, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> we are not normally conscious of them.6 The other animals or humans with raised
consciousness have a wider range of perception. A close relationship with a dog, cat or horse often reveals instances where the animal is aware of a nonphysical 'presence' which is beyond our own

at a minimum, but the solar energies continue to penetrate deep into
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Earth</span> to awaken the embryonic female energies lying <span class="t6 t9 t18 t26 hoverable">far</span> below
the surface. This union produces the prolific growth of springtime.
In spring and summer however, when the Sun's radiation
becomes relatively stronger, the balance between the ultraviolet and
the infrared shifts towards the red <span class="t7 t10 t15 t25 hoverable">end</span> of the spectrum. This awakens the Earth, <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whose</span> energy interacts with the Sun's high-frequency
energy, producing a third kind of energy, which is dynamic growth.
Viktor Schauberger saw this as the discharged precipitates of
higher, bipolar subtle energy. In the summer months the solar energies fuse with their female opposites in the higher strata near the

surface of the Earth. This repeated process of impregnation results
in an almost continuous flow of fertile energies emanating from
deep in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Earth</span> to stimulate burgeoning growth.
Viktor grouped almost all the <span class="t6 t10 t15 hoverable">known</span> elements and their compounds, with the exception of oxygen and hydrogen, under the general classification of 'female.' The exceptions were silver, zinc and
silicon, which were considered to have paternally-oriented characteristics, while gold, copper and limestone were regarded as more
maternal (these will be discussed in more detail in <span class="t12 t19 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">Chapter</span> 17).
Schauberger <span class="t27 hoverable">used</span> the term 'carbones' for all these elements, (the
extra 'e' <span class="t6 t13 t14 t25 t27 hoverable">meaning</span> more than just 'carbon'), because of the prevalence
of various sorts of carbonous matter in the multitude of living
organisms created in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> of Mother Earth.
The Sun's energy, of course, is regarded as male, and Viktor saw
oxygen as a lower <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of solar energy. Together, the role of the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t14 t23 t25 t28 hoverable">Sun</span>
and its assistant oxygen is to fertilize these female, propagative
energies, the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t14 t23 t25 t28 hoverable">Sun</span> being responsible for all of life, and oxygen for
organic growth and development. To hydrogen, Viktor gave a special role, as the carrier substance of both oxygen and carbone (see
Fig. 3.2 above). From a detached view, <span class="t6 t9 t18 t26 hoverable">far</span> outside the atmosphere,
our planet, composed of carbones and fertilized by oxygen, is
indeed floating in the hydrogen gas ocean of space.
The <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">words</span> 'matter' and 'material,' both have their root in the
Latin <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">word</span> mater, <span class="t6 t13 t14 t25 t27 hoverable">meaning</span> mother, which supports the idea that
physical substance is feminine in nature. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> all the physical elements (except for oxygen and hydrogen) can be seen as the maternal progenitive constituents of 'Mother-Earth.' Viktor Schauberger
visualized all physical structures and all <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> living entities coming
into being through the union between these 'mother-substances'
and the inseminating agent of oxygen.

Polarities
Viktor Schauberger <span class="t27 hoverable">used</span> to call polarity Nature's engine. He once
described the harmonious interplay of the attraction and repulsion
of polarized atoms as 'the dance of creation.' Electricity depends on
the positive and negative charge of electrons. Magnetism expresses
the polarities of attraction and repulsion. Polarities <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> apply in
biological terms, of course, where balance is achieved between contrasting qualities, and of course between <span class="t1 t2 t18 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">different</span> sexes.

water, no plants, nor chemical compounds. The mutual attraction of
2 x H and 1 x O gives birth to the marvel of water.
We are more familiar with the terms 'positive' and 'negative' than
'male' and 'female' in scientific contexts; as, for example, with electricity. Of course, positive and negative in this sense are not judgmental terms, but opposite poles. Schauberger felt that to use the
terms masculine and feminine was more in keeping with Nature,
which he saw as a living organic system.

Opposites working towards balance
We tend to think of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Nature</span> as being chaotic. The reverse is true.
Schauberger discovered that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Nature</span> operates <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">according</span> to very

each needs the other to be whole. You <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t18 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">might</span> think that to be in balance, masculine and feminine energies need to be about 50/50, as
they nearly are with the distribution of the <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> sexes.
For the last <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> thousand <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span> or so <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> society has functioned in a predominantly masculine mode and is now quite out of
balance. If you consider masculine energy to be represented by
rationality, concern with the physical, forceful, expansive and individualistic; and the feminine by a tendency to be inclusive, intuitive,
connecting and compassionate — then most will agree we need a
swing of the pendulum towards the latter.
The natural <span class="t0 t8 t12 t15 t19 t23 t25 hoverable">law</span> about balance is that it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> be weighted
towards the feminine for creative growth to proceed. Otherwise
growth (in terms of higher quality) is arrested, and degeneration
takes place. This applies to all the qualities, like:

And then in the more technical areas of life-building energies which
we will cover in the relevant chapters:
gravitation and levitation
electricity and magnetism
oxygen and carbones
centrifugence and centripetence
negative temperature gradient and positive temperate gradient
What is the correct proportion by which the negative should dominate? Ancient Chinese society was very <span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">much</span> <span class="t19 hoverable">taken</span> up with these
questions, and they believed the ratio of the correct balance was
three-fifths (60%) to two-fifths (40%). Viktor Schauberger, who
worked very intuitively, particularly on the temperature gradients
in water, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> up with two-thirds to one-third (66.7%). Callum
Coats, who worked with Viktor's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> Walter, a mathematician and
physicist, related the proportion to the sacred geometric ratio of
(phi) which is 1.618, which gives the negative share of 61.8%.
The interaction and combination of opposites is <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> throughout all natural processes. It is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> of heat and cold. The crucial

There is, however, no such thing as stable equilibrium, which

Gravity and levity
Gravity is recognized as a powerful physical force in the Cosmos.
However, Viktor Schauberger demonstrated that its opposite, levity,
is tremendously important in Nature. That levity is not acknowledged by conventional science presumably has to do with its being

Callum Coats cites:
Research carried out by Dr John Diamond in the field of
behavioral kinesiology (BK), yields some interesting
insights.1 A member of the International Academy of Preventive Medicine, Dr Diamond <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> that while the deltoid muscle of a healthy adult male can normally resist a force of
40-45lbs, its strength is reduced to 10—15lbs through the
negative effect of <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> types of rock music, such as heavy
metal and hard rock.2
In contrast to a more natural rhythm, where the beat
emulates that of the heart, with emphasis on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> beat,
i.e. DA-da-da or 'LUB dup rest,' as he puts it, in the above
type of music this emphasis is reversed, i.e. da-da-DA, which
conflicts with the body's natural pulsation and in poetry is
<span class="t6 t10 t15 hoverable">known</span> as an 'anapestic beat.' As Dr.Diamond states: 'one of
the characteristics of the anapestic beat is that it is stopped
at the <span class="t7 t10 t15 t25 hoverable">end</span> of each bar or measure. Rock music that has this
weakening effect appears to have this stopped quality; it is as
if the music stops and then has to start again, and the
listener subconsciously "comes to a halt" at the <span class="t7 t10 t15 t25 hoverable">end</span> of each
measure. The anapestic beat is the opposite of the dactylic or
waltz <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> beat, which is DA-da-da, and in which there is an

Dr Diamond further asserts that:
these forms of music and unnatural rhythms <span class="t1 t3 t9 t15 t20 t21 t26 t29 hoverable">cause</span> switching
in the brain's responses, which induces 'subtle perceptual difficulties' that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t8 t10 t12 t13 t14 t17 t19 t23 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> manifest themselves in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">children</span> as

An urgent swing from carbon-based energy production to
renewable sources is vital if global warming is gradually to level

this and the type and size of the object contribute to its vibrational

have <span class="t1 t2 t18 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">different</span> resonant frequencies; planet <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Earth</span> has its own — a

health from the ceaseless bombardment of the body's very sensitive, electrically charged cells by the veritable salad of electromagnetic emissions from high-tension cables, radio, television, radar,
microwave transmitters, etc.
A very tragic example of this was publicized by the media in the
summer of 2001.5 The navies of several countries, notably the US
and Britain, have developed sonar technology for hunting submarines. This involves using massive blasts of sound up to 230 decibels which have been blamed for several mass killings and
strandings of marine mammals, notably in the Bahamas in 2000
when at least seventeen Cuvier's beaked whales are <span class="t6 t10 t15 hoverable">known</span> to have
died.
Post mortem examination showed that sonar killed them
through resonance, a process in which air bubbles in <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> can
amplify sound waves by up to 25 times. When whales dive the air is
forced out of their lungs into the tiny air spaces around the brain.
Harmful resonance in these air spaces is believed to <span class="t1 t3 t9 t15 t20 t21 t26 t29 hoverable">cause</span> massive
tissue damage and hemorrhaging, so that injuries can occur at
<span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">much</span> lower sound levels and over a <span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">much</span> larger area than is
presently acknowledged.
The rules that the US navy scientists follow are based on oldfashioned physical science which puts the safe noise level below 180
decibels, and the safe distance below 2.2 km (1.4 miles). There is
now evidence that resonance effects <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> injure whales up to 100
km (62 miles) away.

Cleve Backster was a former CIA interrogator who trained police in

the use of 'threat to wellbeing' to evoke emotionality in suspects. In
a spontaneous experiment, he attached the electrodes of the instrument to a plant. In considering what a plant <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> regard as a

the plant.6
Subsequent experiments, which were then widely repeated by
<span class="t1 t2 t18 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">different</span> researchers, showed that plants are able to communicate
or 'resonate' their shocked or pleasurable experiences to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span>

Because the territory it observes is limited to the physical, conventional science rejects the idea of a cosmic <span class="t0 t6 t7 t8 t11 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">order</span> that affects the

spirals, or in spiraling vortices. Spirals are the actual shape of fluid

the natural movement of life, from the structure of galaxies down to
the atom. The spiral is the most common vehicle for 'correspondences' — as above, so below.
The spiral can develop in a number of <span class="t1 t2 t18 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">different</span> ways: as a vortex, moving upwards or downwards, round in a circle, or doubling

The terrestrial environment is teeming with electromagnetic

Moon's phases, but to some other unidentified non-terrestrial
source. His records showed that all trees, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> hundreds of miles

trees responds to the same electrical rhythm, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> a cosmic

It seems that there are universal laws, not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> fully understood,
which guide an organism's growth into predetermined patterns. As
the vehicle for creative energy, the spiral is clearly involved in the
organic growth of plants and embryos. Buds contain all the concentrated energy of the future plant, and their mathematical analysis
can yield clues as to how this formative energy is expressed. Rudolf
Steiner, the founder of Anthroposophy, initiated these studies,
which have been developed in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> detail by the projective mathematician Lawrence Edwards.11
Edwards discovered that tree buds expand and contract in a
curious rhythm, specific to the species. He applied Steiner's theory
that a species often has a particular connection to a planet. Steiner
suggested correspondences between particular trees and flowers
and <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> planets, for example, the oak with Mars, and the beech
with Saturn. The results clearly showed that these bud pulsations
are linked to the cycles of particular planets. The Moon on its own
had little effect, but when amplified by an alignment with Saturn
(for the beech) and to Mars (in the case of the oak), showed unmistakable fortnightly rhythms. There was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> beech tree studied that

In more traditional communities, the hard, straight lines of

Until modern times the Chinese rejected the Euclidean model.
Their building designs were informed by geomantic principles that
recognized the straight line as the path of the dragon, the personification of destructive energy. This energy <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> be tamed by making it flow into curves and spirals. The Chinese understood in those

Viktor Schauberger saw patterns and rhythms as the heartbeat of
the Universe, and was fascinated by the traditional use of the language of number and <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> to codify how they are repeated and

of <span class="t6 t13 t14 t25 t27 hoverable">meaning</span> and the scientific need for structure and reason. Out
of this process arose the traditions of numerology and sacred
geometry.
In all the ancient cultures, the square symbolized the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Earth</span> of

of <span class="t0 t1 t3 t5 t7 t8 t13 t16 t18 t20 t21 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> and feeling. How to <span class="t22 hoverable">bring</span> them into balance was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span>
'squaring the circle' and was the pursuit both of architecture and
philosophy. The sum of the sides of the square was equal to the circumference of the circle, so they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> into harmony by enclosing
the same area. This is sometimes <span class="t27 hoverable">used</span> as a metaphor for the balanced personality. So 'circling the square' indicates someone <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whose</span>
rationality is greater than his/her sense of feeling.
As with other problems in sacred geometry, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> it is not

to be <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> — in fact in the relationship of the size of the Moon
to the size of the Earth.12 You draw a square around the circle of
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Earth</span> (each side of which will equal the Earth's diameter).
Then you draw the Moon on the same scale, sitting on top of the
Earth. A circle with its centre as the centre of the Earth, and its circumference passing through the centre of the Moon will have a
circumference equal to the sum of the sides of the square enclosing the Earth.

such relationships that the 'Pythagorean canon of proportions' was
created. The basics of musical harmony depend on intervals created
by these <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> proportions. There were canons of architecture, of
painting and of musical harmony taught in the medieval mystery
schools, and partly revived in the Renaissance.

The golden mean
The search for perfect proportion, a shape for containment that is
aesthetically pleasing, led to the discovery of the 'Golden Mean' or
rectangle. The square is too mechanical, a <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> rectangle too
awkward. The shape that 'seems' to be just <span class="t27 hoverable">right</span> is a square rectangle with the proportions 1:1.618. This turns out to be the magical proportion favoured by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Nature</span> in her designs.

Spiral forms often display a similar 'sacred' proportion of
1:1.618; numbers in the Fibonacci series, for example, which maintains the Golden mean proportions indefinitely, and dictates the
beautiful spirals in a sunflower head, Nature's ingenious <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> of

from triangles, squares, polygons, to Golden mean rectangles, which

All the traditional arts and sciences were based on the same cosmic truths expressed in number, and the sacred numbers were the
ratios in a revealed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> order, drawn from the experience of mystics and confirmed by precise measurements of the solar system.

Why are the accepted methods of producing energy so inefficient?

in most cases more than twice. This has up to now not been of concern, as fossil fuels have been regarded as unlimited and free for the

as for example with solar panels, it is renewable; it does not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">take</span>
from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Earth</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> giving back.
To compare the efficiency of modern technology with that of the

Walter Schauberger (Viktor's son) calculated that a typical car on a journey of 1000 km (621 miles) consumes as <span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">much</span> energy as a <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> being uses in a <span class="t3 t5 t7 t9 t20 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> year. In an
11 hour journey, the car has consumed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> being's annual
oxygen requirement. To replenish the oxygen consumed by the
world's motor vehicles annually requires healthy forest covering
28% of the world's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">land</span> area, <span class="t6 t9 t18 t26 hoverable">far</span> more forest than our present, and
dwindling, forest cover.2 There is alarming evidence that the
amount of free oxygen in our atmosphere is actually reducing. This
comes from an analysis of air captured in bubbles in ancient glaciers in Antarctica as <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t8 t10 t12 t13 t14 t17 t19 t23 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> as in amber.
Using the famous Hasenohrl-Einstein equation E=mc2, Walter
Schauberger calculated that the amount of energy stored in 1 gram of
material substance (e.g. flesh, wood, water) amounts to 25 million
kWh.3 The challenge is how to unlock this source of energy. Viktor
Schauberger once said: 'More energy is encapsulated in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> drop of

Schauberger observed that Nature's methods of producing
energy were <span class="t6 t9 t18 t26 hoverable">far</span> more efficient, which led him to design implosion
machines for natural energy production in the belief that they
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> solve the crisis of modern technology.

The blocking of these creative energies by the emanations from
modern technological processes Schauberger saw as the most dangerous <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of pollution. Their heat, pressure and, above all, chaotic
effects actually destroy the more delicate energies of Nature's constructive developmental processes. Thus, chemicals invading a

have on the environment? Clearly, if humanity is to reverse the

The choice before us
Humanity lived a relatively natural and sustainable lifestyle until
fairly recent times. The growth of industry and its massive demand
for energy resources has introduced increasing degrees of instability. Going back over 2000 years, but <span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">much</span> more clearly in the last
350 years, it has been possible to chart a <span class="t1 t2 t18 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">different</span> kind of development which has <span class="t2 t4 t5 t22 t23 hoverable">brought</span> with it a deterioration of the natural environment, increasing disorder and inefficiency.
Callum Coats shows this divergence of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> systems in the
accompanying chart (Fig. 5.1). In the last 150 <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span> with rapid
industrialization, a scientifically based technology developed, and
the divergence shown by the lower curve has <span class="t8 t13 hoverable">become</span> dramatic, with
dire consequences for the environment.
By contrast, the curve rising up toward 'ectropy' shows how natural evolution builds more complex systems with more evolved
species on the foundation of earlier ones. This is how biodiversity
increases. The appearance of <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> species requires a surplus of evolutionary energies deriving from the improved conditions of interdependence.

surplus on Nature's interest.

What Schauberger calls the 'techno-mechanical economic system' produces a downward curve, accelerating as unnatural systems
of energy are applied more widely. Pollution apart, these systems are
clearly inefficient. In the 1970s, Walter Schauberger discussed
industrial efficiency with Dr Fritz Kortegast, head of research and
development at Mercedes-Benz in Stuttgart, who confirmed that at
that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> the propulsive energy produced by their most sophisticated engines was only 13% of the total energy introduced, the balance consumed as dissipated heat and pollution.

So, physical manifestation depends on the movement of energy.
All of Nature's creations that we observe are the outward shell of
the formative energy path. Schauberger <span class="t27 hoverable">used</span> to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">say</span> that a tree will

He demonstrated that the vortex is the natural <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of movement for energy. The accompanying photograph (Fig. 5.3) <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t8 t10 t12 t13 t14 t17 t19 t23 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> illustrates the spiraling <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> that <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> prefers.

the mathematics and proportions of this structure.8
Callum Coats <span class="t27 hoverable">used</span> the action of our weather to demonstrate the
importance of the vortex in creating material substance. The spiraling air masses possess very little density, very slow rotational velocities and a large radius of influence. When these air masses
converge, they gain in speed with the reduction in their radius of
rotation.

with increasing velocity they <span class="t8 t13 hoverable">become</span> denser and more physical. The

Viktor Schauberger <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> it hard to understand why science has
not ascribed any fundamental importance to the natural movement
of energy and Nature's systems of spiral movement, which are so

between Nature's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> of working and the prevailing <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> technology. He realized that the principles under which conventional
technology operates <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> be basically unsound to have produced
such appalling consequences for water, for soil and indeed for all of
life.
Most of us are aware of the effects of chemicals in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> and
on the soil, of the dangers of radioactive waste and biotechnology.
But Schauberger was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> concerned with something <span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">much</span> more

Our machines and technological processes channel agents such

Through its dependence on the decomposing mode of motion
our technology is dangerously affecting the vital biodiversity and
balance of our ecosystems, the stability of our societies, and is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of

then, that our technology is self-destructive and unsustainable.
Our mechanical, technological systems of motion are based on
explosive, outward pushing energies which always meet resistance,
producing heat and friction. This <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of movement goes out at a
tangent, producing the fastest movement at the periphery (as in a

because so <span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">much</span> of the energy is dissipated. The effect is to break
apart, to fragment. This is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> we generate our power; from the

itself, there is not the resistance or dissipation of energy that is
<span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> in the explosive process. The reverse takes place, cooling and
condensing. Schauberger <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> this 'constructive' movement.

'destructive,' because the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">word</span> has such a negative connotation,
and it has its rightful purpose in Nature; instead he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> it'deconstructive.' Viktor Schauberger demonstrated with his remarkable
implosion machines that replicated the in-winding motion of
Nature, that this was the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> to create energy for <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> needs in

As Schauberger's discovery has such enormous implications for
the future of <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> culture, why has it not been openly debated in
scientific circles? The reasons are two-fold. Firstly, Schauberger,
being persona non grata with the German postwar establishment,
was not granted the oxygen of publicity. Secondly, he was talked of
in postwar Germany as a Nazi collaborator, by association rather
than fact, as his <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t7 t10 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> for the Nazi regime was carried out under
duress. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Though</span> both the Russians and the Americans secretly confiscated his research papers, the Cold War <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t11 t20 t26 t27 hoverable">days</span> kept his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> in the

the alternative culture, but as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> have not <span class="t8 t13 hoverable">become</span> more widely
known.

The 'original' motion
Viktor Schauberger was always comparing terrestrial laws of
motion to the patterns of movement in the Heavens. He firmly
believed that there existed a 'form originating' motion that was
responsible for the evolutionary dynamics of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Earth</span> and the Cosmos, generally referring to it as the 'original' motion. The <span class="t3 t5 t7 t9 t20 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> Universe is continually in motion. This movement is in spirals, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span>

<span class="t12 t19 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">Chapter</span> 4, forms in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Nature</span> very often follow the <span class="t0 t8 t12 t15 t19 t23 t25 hoverable">law</span> 'As Above, so

motion. Liquids and gases prefer to move in spirals; likewise energy.
Dowsers find energy spirals in the ground. Energy in the <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span>

The terrestrial biocondenser
While Fig. 7.2 illustrates the principle of a normal electrical condenser, Fig. 7.5 shows the typical situation at layers of the atmosphere where the air temperature is close to the anomaly point of
+4°C (39°F). The pure <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> layer takes the <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> of the dielectric
layer. Generally speaking the positively charged surface is influenced by the positive temperature gradient, and the negatively
charged surface by the negative gradient. If the charge of the positive <span class="t14 hoverable">plate</span> is raised, that of the negative <span class="t14 hoverable">plate</span> will rise automatically
to the same level, the charges being distributed evenly on the plates'
surfaces.

Fig. 7.5, drawn roughly to scale, shows how we can <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> that each

these layers <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> a condenser with concentric spherical plates. This

spherical +4°C (39°F) dielectric layer, the energy potential coming
from the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t14 t23 t25 t28 hoverable">Sun</span> is gradually magnified. As the Sun's energy penetrates
the atmosphere, it becomes increasingly concentrated as it
approaches the Earth's surface, due to these enveloping layers of
+4°C (39°F) water. (Remember that pure <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> does not freeze at

Viktor Schauberger was concerned to identify which natural

favoured an energy matrix being created by the 'original' motion

It seems reasonable to propose that these variously charged layers in the atmosphere are a product of the Earths rotation. The

These experiments demonstrate that through an increase of

Ozone is created by the intense ionization caused by an electrical

Electricism and magnetism
Viktor Schauberger coined the term 'electricism' for the effect that
electricity has on life, which is destructive, dismantling, disintegrative and debilitating. Magnetism is the energy that circulates
through and around the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Earth</span> on its polar axis. Electricism and
magnetism are apparently contradictory (or dialectic partners, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span>

responsible for the combining of elements in the creative process of

fourth dimension). Bioelectricism, on the other hand, is associated
with the deconstructive aspect of organic life.
As we saw in <span class="t12 t19 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">Chapter</span> 3, bioelectricism and biomagnetism are
complementary, but operate differently in contrasting functions,
representing extremes of bielectromagnetic quality.

It is essential to all life. Yet, our present science understands little of
its real nature. We have no respect for water; we use it for transporting inappropriate substances, usually waste and pollutants. We
destroy its complex structures by driving it through turbines, pipes
or straightened riverbanks. We treat it as a commodity. Viktor
Schauberger <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> it a living organism,'the blood of the Earth,' and
insisted that in its various forms, as blood, sap or water, it is the
basis of all life.

His principal preoccupation was with <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> as the key to all life, and its vital relationship to the forest.

arrest its creative processes and when it becomes our enemy it can
do enormous damage.
As a young man, searching for inspiration in his beloved forest,
Viktor was sitting quietly by the bank of a pristine stream when
he unexpectedly <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> that his consciousness entered the water. It
connected with an <span class="t20 hoverable">intelligence</span> in the <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> that spoke to him. It
told him what movements it needed to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> in <span class="t0 t6 t7 t8 t11 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">order</span> to stay
healthy, and under what conditions. It was from this mystical
experience that he built up his awareness of how healthy <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> is

structures, convoluted in form, and with magical vortical shapes.

The reason that you find trees and shrubs
growing on the banks of streams is not from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> planting them,
but because the energies from the flowing stream facilitated their
growth there, to shade the water. When a stream is able to maintain
its energies, it will rarely overflow its banks. In its natural motion,
the faster it flows, the greater its carrying capacity and scouring
ability and the more it deepens its bed (Fig. 8.2).
Schauberger discovered the reason for this — that in-winding,
longitudinal spiral vortices <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> down the central axis of the current, moving alternately clockwise and anti-clockwise.

of inwardly-spiralling vortical movement is to cool. So these complex <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> movements constantly cool and re-cool the water, maintaining it at a healthy temperature, leading to a faster, more laminar,
spiral flow, ejecting or transforming undesirable substances.
As the stream gets bigger, it is less able to protect itself from

this its ability to energize the environment through which it passes.

This, however, protects the lower strata from the heat of the Sun.

flooding. This motion <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> discourages the generation of harmful

It is possible to regulate watercourses over any <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> distance

The temperature gradient

with temperature. He showed how small variations of temperature
are as crucial to the healthy movement of <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> and sap as they are
for the <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> blood. He clarified this by identifying temperature
change in its relationship to the anomaly point of <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> +4°C
(39.2°F). When the temperature departs from this anomaly point,
either up or down, it is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to have a negative gradient. When it
approaches the anomaly point, from either direction, or when the
groundwater is colder than the air temperature, it has a positive gradient. Heat always moves towards cold.
In the natural process of synthesis and decomposition in all

areas of heavy rainfall causes catastrophic floods. The <span class="t1 t3 t9 t15 t20 t21 t26 t29 hoverable">cause</span> of the
floods in recent years, in Columbia, Mozambique, Assam and
Bangladesh was the deforestation on high ground.
This disruption of the natural <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> cycle Schauberger <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span>
the half hydrological cycle, which is now prevalent almost worldwide. Notice the difference between Fig. 9.2 below and Fig. 9.1 on
p. 118. The drawing below shows that, in the absence of tree cover,
the <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> table has sunk. Once the forest has been removed, the
exposed ground heats up rapidly, all the more so if dry, and to
<span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">much</span> higher temperatures.
This type of evaporation, now lacking the evapo-transpiration
from living things, has more destructive energies. If the rainfall is
excessive, then flooding inevitably occurs. In <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> hot countries

In the absence of trees and ground cover to absorb it, the rainwater spreads widely over the surface of the ground, resulting in massive
abnormal re-evaporation. The increase in <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> vapour in the atmosphere soon causes increased precipitation. What happens is that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span>
flood causes another, while in inland areas, droughts <span class="t8 t13 hoverable">become</span> more
frequent. The only answer to this vicious cycle is a massive international campaign to plant trees, particularly in the warmer latitudes.
The most serious result of the half cycle is that there is no replenishment of the groundwater. With the sinking of the groundwater
level, the supply of nutrients to the vegetation is cut off. The <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span>

Fig. 9.3 a illustrates a positive temperature
gradient — ground cooler shaded by trees —
rainwater warmer than the ground surface will
soak in easily, recharging the groundwater. But
where the surface is unprotected (Fig. 9.3 b) it
heats up, does not allow the rainwater to

effect of global warming is complex. The atmosphere <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> warms up

heat being offset by the loss of <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> atoms at high altitudes.

Temperature gradients and nutrient supply
As we have seen, unless vegetation keeps the ground surface cooler
than the falling rain, the <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> will not easily penetrate the soil. The
direction of the temperature gradient indicates the direction of
movement. Energy or nutrient transfer is always from heat to cold.
So a positive temperature gradient is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> essential for nutrients to

If the surface is <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t8 t10 t12 t13 t14 t17 t19 t23 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> forested, the rainwater is warmer than the
soil, and penetrates to the lower strata, replenishing the groundwater <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> and the aquifers. The salts remain at a level where they <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">cannot</span> pollute the upper strata where they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> harm those plants
which are salt-sensitive. The groundwater hugs the configuration of
the ground surface. Fig. 9.3 shows how the salts in the ground rise
near the surface, particularly on a hilltop, when <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of the forest is
cut down, leaving the ground exposed to sunlight.
Schauberger demonstrated that when <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> and air are absent

ground will encourage evaporation of the moisture near the surface,
so that the minerals and salts are deposited near the surface, lowering the fertility of the soil. If all the trees are removed (Fig. 9.4), there
will be no penetration of rainwater; the <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> table initially rises,

All healthy rivers will carry nutrients in suspension that will
be absorbed by the vegetation on the river banks if the soil is
cooler than the river water. This improves soil fertility and
recharges the groundwater. But, if the soil is warmer than the
river, due to the absence of protective cover, a negative temperature gradient will <span class="t1 t3 t9 t15 t20 t21 t26 t29 hoverable">cause</span> the nutrients to leach from the soil into

Where the tree cover cools the river, it flows faster with a laminar structure, removing sediment and deepening its bed.

some established a reputation for curative powers. Viktor
Schauberger insisted that the high quality <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> produced by his
springwater machine had healing qualities.

The veneration of springs
Springs have <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> been associated with folk medicine, ritual and
religion, frequently being reported as places of <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> in the landscape. Usually, springs <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> endowed are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> 'holy wells' which is

The tradition of venerated springs is <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> in all cultures and major
religions, including the earliest <span class="t6 t10 t15 hoverable">known</span> to us. The most common
association is the bestowal of supernatural qualities, but more
specifically as the abode of spirits or deities, or being linked with
<span class="t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t12 t15 t19 t20 t23 t25 hoverable">holy</span> figures or saints. In Britain, in most cases the saints named had
no connection with the site, but their qualities <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be associated
with those the previous pagans had ascribed.
The waters of most sacred springs are credited with healing
powers, and with cures accomplished by bathing or drinking. In
British lore the most common affliction claimed to be healed by
springs is infertility, followed by eye complaints. <span class="t27 t28 hoverable">However</span> some
springs are regarded as so powerful — as at Lourdes in France, or
Bath in England — that they are reputed to heal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> diseases.

Seepage springs
What is generally understood as a spring is actually not a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span>

Rainwater which is warmer than the ground (a positive temperature gradient), soaks in and descends until it reaches an impervious layer <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> clay, which channels it out as a stream to the surface

responds quickly to variations in precipitation, frequently drying

by minerals from the action of the aggressive mountain streams
eroding the surface rocks.
The rainwater penetrates the ground surface under the influence of a positive temperature gradient, in a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> similar to that

helped by the increasing pressure, so that it condenses and cools
to around +4°C (39°F). Being immature water, it will absorb what
it can, so it removes salts from the upper layers of the ground,

now available to deep-rooted trees that have the ability to metabolize them, converting them to nutrients for more shallow-rooted
plants.
The downwards-percolating rainwater increases the pressure
on the groundwater body, pressing the lowest layer into rocks that

springs with their flow. This action explains how springs can
emerge from high mountain peaks at such cold temperatures,

How springwater rises
Viktor Schauberger designed an experiment to demonstrate how
groundwater rises during the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> and recedes at night. The equipment consists of a glass U-tube with open ends, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of which has
contact with the air only by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> very fine capillary tubes, the other
<span class="t7 t10 t15 t25 hoverable">end</span> being open. Each arm is sealed off from the other by some
saltwater-saturated sand at the bottom of the U-tube. High grade
springwater with low oxygen content, and having had no contact
with strong light, is inserted into each arm. The U-tube is placed
in a soil-filled bucket, containing ice at the bottom to create an
artificial environment of +4°C (39°F) temperature.
When the bucket is <span class="t0 t2 t16 t18 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">put</span> out in the Sun, a positive temperature
gradient is <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t15 t17 t18 t19 hoverable">set</span> up and, because there is greater contact with the
outside atmosphere, the <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> level can rise on the open <span class="t7 t10 t15 t25 hoverable">end</span> of
the U-tube. At night, when the temperature gradient decreases,

on the river. Soils are quickly depleted of their nutrients by agriculture, particularly if intensive. Remineralization by regular flooding

The <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> is creating its own <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span>
which in turn regulates its flow.
Entering the plains the river, in its natural way, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> meander

manipulate the river, heavy with silt, by straight embankments to
stop the river spreading where it wants to. These natural floods are
not particularly destructive, and remineralize the soil which

control Nature. The <span class="t25 hoverable">old</span> river is now typically forced to perch sometimes 50 feet above the surrounding countryside. If the river should
burst its artificial banks at this stage, the flooding is catastrophic.
Lacking its normal twisting movement and positive temperature
gradient which keep the silt in suspension, it is deposited, blocking
the channel. Its natural path <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> obstructed, it becomes angry and

degree of heating depends on the amount of friction with the

the type of temperature gradient prevailing determines the action. A
negative temperature gradient causes the deposition of sediment,
and a positive temperature gradient provokes its removal. The temperature gradients alternating too suddenly can, however, <span class="t1 t3 t9 t15 t20 t21 t26 t29 hoverable">cause</span> the

11. RIVERS AND HOW THEY FLOW

Fig. 11.1. Alternate heating and cooling

flow.
Friction with the river bed gradually warms the
river (negative temperature gradient) so that it
starts to deposit its suspended sediment. When
this reaches its maximum, an overfall occurs,
producing a horizontal barrel vortex that cools the
<span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> (positive temperature gradient), until the
river gradually warms up again. Schauberger
likened this to the river 'breathing.'

In Fig. 11.1, for example, from A to B the temperature gradient
is negative. From A to B the <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> gradually heats up and in the
process is unable to retain the sediment in suspension and drops it
progressively as the <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> becomes warmer. At B, the zone of maximum deposition, the accumulated material results in an overfall
that, in turn, creates a horizontal barrel vortex immediately downstream. This vortex, however, cools the <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> from B
to C the temperature gradient becomes positive. The sediment is
once more picked up and transported. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Upon</span> reaching C, the effect
of the positive temperature gradient gives <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> to its negative counterpart and the suspended matter is again dropped, reaching a maximum at D.
This pulsation or alternation is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> breathing; a positive temperature gradient representing the inbreath, the absorbing, material-collecting movement; the negative temperature gradient
representing the outbreath, where the energetically transformed
matter is exhaled from the system and deposited. In <span class="t0 t6 t7 t8 t11 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">order</span> to regulate a river naturally and successfully, it is essential to study the
alternating sequence of the temperature gradients. A stretch of
river with a positive gradient is less likely to flood, since only
minor sediment deposition will occur. If the danger of flooding is
to be reduced then a positive temperature gradient <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> be recreated or its duration extended. This can be done in four principal
ways:
1. By shading and cooling the river through the replanting of
trees, particularly at the bends, where the friction and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span>
the warming tendencies are greatest. Tree species with a high evaporation rate should be planted. Through evaporation the sap in the
tree is cooled and circulates down to the roots under the river bed,
cooling the <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> as well. This kind of tree <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> acts <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> a
refrigerator.
In <span class="t0 t6 t7 t8 t11 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">order</span> to maintain the health of the river, there should be a belt
of trees 500 to 1000 metres wide. Rivers flowing through cleared,

healthy flow conditions, restore the nutrient supply and recharge
the groundwater table in its vicinity (Fig. 11.2).
2. By the construction of appropriately designed dams in which
the temperature of the discharge can be controlled <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">according</span> to the

Current practice with most dams and <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> storage facilities is

stretch of river where the temperature gradient is only slightly positive, will effectively cancel the effect of the positive gradient, resulting in the automatic and almost simultaneous deposition of silt and

If the river is initially shaded on both banks, the
profile of the channel at section 1-11 will be

the cooling makes the oxygen and silicates more passive and able to
combine with carbones, which then produce a fructigenic or
growth-promoting effect.

the river (transverse vortices), or vertical vortices ascending to the
surface from the river bed. In these the oxygen is heated, becoming
aggressive, and producing low quality, germinating-inhibiting energies or pathogen-producing bacteria. This often happens as a result
of poorly conceived river regulation, and can propagate harmful
energies to the countryside.

The formation of bends
A river will always follow a sinuous energy-generating path, because
this is in its nature, unless mountains or other immovable objects
prevent it. Rivers are the mirrors of an unseen flow of energy.
The <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> on the <span class="t27 hoverable">right</span> bank heats up where it has been exposed
to the Sun's heat (see Fig. 11.6 section and profile 2-21); the <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span>

The <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> flowing along the left-hand bank
which is cooler and faster moving then overtakes the slower moving

bend. The faster flow will pull the heavier sediment centrifugally to
the left, while sediment on the <span class="t27 hoverable">right</span> is scoured out by the colder
water. Meanwhile at this point the cross-sectional profile of the river
becomes asymmetrical, due to the varying flows and temperatures,
the coldest <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> flowing in the deeper section of the channel.

bend is formed in the opposite direction due to the momentum of

Viktor Schauberger's most vigorous campaign was to try to persuade the Bonn government to restore the Rhine and the Danube to
their natural courses. He was greatly disturbed by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> in which

flooding and disease-promoting. Tree felling on the river banks has
only exacerbated the problem.
Often the rivers have been regulated through trapezoid-shaped
canals in the misplaced belief that the flow <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be improved. In

So in 1930 he <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t15 t17 t18 t19 hoverable">set</span> about designing a pipe that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> actually encourage this movement.

movement was created by a <span class="t14 hoverable">series</span> of guide vanes, which act <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span>

Fig. 12.1. The double-spiral longitudinal
vortex.
This is a longitudinal vortex showing the
development of toroidal counter-vortices. These
occur due to interaction with the porous pipe
walls and have an effect similar to ball-bearings,
enhancing the forward movement. Their interior
rotation follows the direction of rotation and flow
of the central vortex. These toroidal vortices
transfer oxygen, bacteria and other impurities to
the pipe walls, where the concentration of oxygen
destroys the inferior, pathogenic bacteria.

The Stuttgart tests
As the scientific establishment had <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> <span class="t19 hoverable">taken</span> seriously his ideas
on natural <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> movement, Viktor Schauberger in later <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> decided
to have them subjected to rigorous tests by an independent authority. In 1952 he asked the Stuttgart Technical University to <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t15 t17 t18 t19 hoverable">set</span> up the
experiments at his own expense. He approached Professor Franz
Popel, director of the Institute of Hygiene who, knowing
Schauberger's infamous reputation, at <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> refused, <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t9 t11 t12 t15 t16 t17 t22 t24 t27 hoverable">saying</span> it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span>
be a waste of his time.
The German Government had been irritated by Viktor's railing
about its management of the River Rhine. So, hearing about
Schauberger's proposal, it was happy to offer to cover half the costs,
thinking that any genuine tests were bound to discredit him. As a
result of this, Professor Popel changed his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> and agreed to test
the various rifled and helical pipes that Viktor supplied.
The object of the tests was to compare how <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> moves through
eight <span class="t1 t2 t18 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">different</span> kinds of pipe, the velocity of the <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> flow being
affected by friction varying <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">according</span> to the <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of the pipe. The
configurations that produced the most friction were the straight
pipes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> of glass or of copper. Introducing a sinuosity to the pipe
reduced the friction, while Viktor's special 'spiral helicoid' copper
pipe directed the <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> flow in an involuting flow movement <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">away</span>
from the walls, giving the greatest reduction in friction, to zero or
perhaps <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> below (negative friction or acceleration) at specific
velocities.22
Because of expectations of his peers, Popel's report played down
the significance of the experiment, which in fact in these circumstances disproved the relevance of the <span class="t6 hoverable">Second</span> <span class="t0 t8 t12 t15 t19 t23 t25 hoverable">Law</span> of Thermodynamics, which states that energy in any closed systems <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span>

once the initial impetus has been received, no further energy input
is required. In other words, energy is not a constant. In this case it
was increased through the emergence of fifth or sixth dimensional
dynagens (see <span class="t12 t19 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">Chapter</span> 2) created by what Schauberger <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> 'original' or 'cosmic' movement. Popel did, however, admit that in
Schauberger's special pipe, friction at <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> specific velocities
appeared to reduce to zero.

The circulation of blood
It is a common experience for those who use the ancient practice
of watching the breath when they meditate, of the strange sensation of 'being breathed;' that the process seems to be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of a

Viktor Schauberger <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> often insist in a similar vein, that a bird 'is flown and a fish 'is swum.'

saw the heart, rather, as a regulator or of blood flow. The spurts of

flow was in resonance with the configuration of the pipe, there was
no friction. Similarly the blood being in resonance with the arteries and capillaries greatly facilitates flow. In addition the blood
vessels have a natural pulsating, peristaltic action. About 1927,
Professor Kurt Bergel of Berlin University recorded this automatic
pulsation a few <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t11 t20 t26 t27 hoverable">days</span> after incubation in small warm blood vessels
around the egg sac of a bird's egg, although no <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t16 t19 t22 t23 t25 t26 hoverable">heart</span> had <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> been

<span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t16 t19 t22 t23 t25 t26 hoverable">heart</span> as a pump, insisting that this function was carried out by 'the
millions of highly active capillaries permeating the body,' and that
'health and disease are primarily dependent on the faultless or
disturbed activity of the capillaries.'23
It appears that the pulsation of the capillaries initiate the circulation of the blood, augmented by the configuration of the blood
vessels themselves.24 The specifications for these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have been

The Stuttgart experiments showed that a specific configuration is required for frictionless flow to occur. Schauberger maintained that energy creates the vessel most conducive to its desired

always try to move frictionlessly in healthy, animate, organic systems. Seen in this light, the pulsating, almost frictionless flow of
blood over these enormous distances becomes more comprehensible. It is important that further investigations should be pursued into the lines of research that Viktor Schauberger pioneered.

Earth's 'lungs.' There have been <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> periods when forests have

forests, interspersed with enormous swamps. In the Eocene when
the modern <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> mountain ranges were being uplifted, there were
large tropical jungles, perhaps not too <span class="t1 t2 t18 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">different</span> from the modern
ones which flourished on all the continents until the late nineteenth
century, but with less complex fauna.
It is interesting to speculate what caused the forests to establish
themselves at these periods. Viktor Schauberger recognized <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Nature</span>
as an intelligent system endowed with <span class="t6 t13 t14 t25 t27 hoverable">meaning</span> and purpose that is
concerned with evolving more complex life-forms and a higher level

Forest cover varies with climate. Forests have been the natural
cover of perhaps <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> quarters of the Earth's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">land</span> surface during
these periods of evolutionary expansion. This natural forest was an
essential prerequisite for the development of the extraordinarily
rich variety of fauna and flora (now <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> 'biodiversity') that makes

In North America, the forest extended from the Atlantic to beyond
the Mississippi, and of course west of the Rockies.
Sometimes the forests were exploited to provide fast economic
expansion, regardless of the cost to future generations. In <span class="t0 t6 t7 t8 t11 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">order</span> to

virtually denuding England of its mature oaks. The world's forest
cover was reduced from about 75% at its greatest to about 50% in
medieval times. By 1900 it had dropped to about 35%. In the frantic rush to get rich quick, regardless of the consequences, the figure
has dropped to 25% and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> year we are still losing equatorial forest the size of Belgium.

seen in the future as dangerous planetary vandalism, because their

society clearly deteriorated and they had felled all the trees, so that
by AD500, there was no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> to build a boat and leave the island. The

Of all the violations we have committed against the beautiful
and fertile planet we call home, the destruction of the forests is the
hardest to comprehend. The effects of such actions are so quickly
apparent, in terms of soil depletion, or in extreme cases, of erosion
of the living soil layer by rain or wind, and indeed, through climate
change. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> floods of the Rhine in recent years, and the devastating floods in Bangladesh and the mud slides in Assam and
Honduras have been caused demonstrably by deforestation in the
mountains. In spite of this, the tree felling continues. When the
European immigrants settled in North America, there was continuous forest from the Atlantic to the Mississippi.
Five thousand <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span> earlier the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Midwestern prairies and

temperate latitudes were created over hundreds of thousands of
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span> by rich natural forest. (Grasslands do not produce deep soils.)
And <span class="t5 t7 hoverable">within</span> a hundred <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span> we have ruined these, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> by intensive

and the East Anglian wheat fields have lost on average half their soil
depth. When in 1999, over 30,000 <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> died in mudslides in
Venezuela, scientists blamed the weather! The obvious lessons are
not being learned, which suggests that our 'experts' are completely
out of touch with reality, a complaint frequently voiced by Viktor
Schauberger!
We are told that the critical point <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> soon be reached when
there will not be enough forest to produce sufficient oxygen to support high quality life. For the forests are the lungs of the Earth,
breathing in carbon dioxide (CO2) and exhaling oxygen (O). When
the trees are felled, and again when they are burned, they contribute
to the mass of carbon dioxide, the principal global warming gas.
Recent analyses of fossilized amber have shown that their air bubbles contained 38% oxygen. Today the average oxygen content of air
is 19%, which suggests that the <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> was designed to operate at twice today's concentration of oxygen. In some larger cities
the oxygen content has deteriorated to as low as 12%.

Crucially, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> still little understood, forests create the environment for the propagation of water, the 'first-born' of the energies
of life, as Schauberger puts it, and they moderate the climate, making it cooler in summer and warmer in winter. They are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> responsible for the mineralization and fertilization of the surface soils,

of all, the forests create the rich humus and bacterial life, the foundation of a rich biodiversity, which stores and recycles vast amounts
of rainfall, preventing floods on lower land.3

Tropical rainforests
Everyone who has the opportunity, before it is too late, should visit
a tropical rainforest, for they are the priceless jewels of our ecosystem. Important not just for the incredible richness and variety of
their fauna and flora, they have had a substantially modifying influence on the world's climate, helping to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> most of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Earth</span>
pleasantly habitable and very productive. They were on four continents, but are now only about half their extent of 500 <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span> ago: the
South American is the most complete, at about 75% of its original
size; the South-east Asian, from India, through Indo-China to
Indonesia and Australia is about a third of what it was, and the
African about 40% of its original size. The Central American has
virtually disappeared.
More than twice as <span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">much</span> of the Sun's energy reaches the Earth's

above the horizon is very low. The tropical rainforests of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span>
act as heat pumps, transferring to higher latitudes some of the enormous energy they generate, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> evening out the temperature difference. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Without</span> them, the equatorial regions <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be <span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">much</span> hotter,
and the higher latitudes <span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">much</span> colder. The larger the mass of a tropical rainforest, the more effective it is as a heat pump.
Now that we know, from a study of the Amazonian rainforest,
how the heat pump works, it is possible to conjecture that the
African continent <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> not have been nearly as dry as it is today.
In South-East Asia the destruction has reached cataclysmic proportions, with a free-for-all between corrupt local interests and greedy
multinational companies who are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> extracting minerals at a fast

Within the last decade both droughts and storms have, for example
in Australia, <span class="t8 t13 hoverable">become</span> consistently more severe. With the accelerated
destruction of the forest, the climatic future of the region looks
grim. Amazonia contains two-thirds of the world's surviving tropical rainforest, representing about 30% of all the biological material
on the land.4 You can imagine that when all four tropical rain forests
were intact, they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> have contained the greater <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of the plant
and animal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> on Earth.
The released energy drives the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> air masses across the
Amazon basin to the Andes, recycling the rain and evapo-transpiration several times in a leapfrogging process (see Fig. 13.1).
The airflow then splits into three: the southern <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> is deflected

Pacific, continuing west as the trade winds; the northern airflow
crosses the Caribbean, and helps to drive the Gulf Stream northeastwards to Europe.6 Rainforests act as thermal engines, rainfall
stimulators and as regulators of atmospheric and oceanic systems. They moderate the climate of the <span class="t3 t5 t7 t9 t20 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Earth</span> and help to

The Amazon Basin, which comprises 7 million km2 of rainforest, is the biggest and most efficient energy transformer on Earth7;
it is self-maintaining when complete, but 25% has already been
lost in the last 35 years. Five million km2 lie in Brazil which has
recently unveiled an accelerated development plan (see below)
that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> result in the loss of a further 20% by 2020 (a total loss
of forest of 45%!). There is a critical size of the Amazonian rainforest below which this complex heat engine and rainfall distributor will fail. Some authorities claim that if it shrinks to <span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">much</span> less
than the present 75% of its original area, the forest will not be able
to perform these critical functions effectively, resulting in more
hostile weather patterns and drought across the globe.8
Areas that have been clear-felled <span class="t0 t2 t16 t18 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">put</span> at risk the remaining forest
for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> miles from the edge of the deforested area, rendering the
marginal area more susceptible to die-back due to the local increase
in temperature. In fact, the Amazonian forest through deforestation
is generally losing its ability to withstand the worldwide temperature increase created by global warming. At some point, perhaps in
the next twenty <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span> (or sooner under present Brazilian plan), a

this vital energy transformer to fail.
13. THE ROLE OF THE FOREST

Preservation of this precious forest is a tough battle. In June
2000, the biggest landowners in Brazil who control 50% of the agricultural land, pushed a draft <span class="t0 t8 t12 t15 t19 t23 t25 hoverable">law</span> through the Brazilian senate committee which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have allowed a 25% increase in annual rates of
clearing and burning of the forest. An international email campaign
amongst environmentalists, instantly mounted, generated hundreds of thousands of signatures, forcing the Congress to back

If a forest's climate changes over hundreds or thousands of years,
the types of trees that grow in it will gradually change, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span>
threatening the survival of the forest. However, if the rate of climate
change accelerates, as it is doing today, <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> species disappear

The forest starts to lose its vitality and will gradually deteriorate into an arid wasteland.
The modern science of forestry began in the early nineteenth century. Napoleon in his passage over the Alps removed an unbelievable
number of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> trees, and the Swiss were determined to restore the
damage. Less concerned with mass production than we are today,
they insisted that planting <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> be of appropriate species. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Though</span>
this sensitivity to landscape and the environment is still practised in

higher forms of life. The destruction of the forest brings with it the
destruction of water, with appalling consequences.

Monoculture
If you go into a typical plantation, it is impenetrable, dark, and feels
dead — a veritable green desert. No birds sing nor animals scurry,
and there is little opportunity for any other plants to grow. Those
that do are removed on the theory that they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">take</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">away</span> nourishment
from the trees. In fact their absence increases the competition. The
individual trees are all of the same age and species; they vie with
each other for space and for nutrients (of which there is a limited
amount for each species), for their roots go down to the same level,
creating a hard pan of salts which prevents access to the valuable
minerals and energized groundwater below. There is only a <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span>
amount of each element and chemical compound available which is
suitable for that species and all the trees <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whose</span> lives are wholly

It is hardly surprising that the wood from such a plantation is
of very poor quality. You <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t18 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">might</span> compare the composition of a

clones of each other, and there were no elder statesmen or wise
elders, how creatively barren and spiritually impoverished <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span>

The rainforest has <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> layers of trees and shrubs, the high

trees with deep root systems <span class="t22 hoverable">bring</span> up valuable minerals and nutrients from below, beyond the reach of the more shallow-rooted. The
micro-organisms on the forest floor thrive on the rich variety of
leaves and provide valuable nourishment for all the plants.
The ground remains cool and moist due to the protection of the
trees overhead and the rich spongy humus can retain up to 85% of

This raises the ground temperatures, the delicate soil-capillaries are
destroyed which deliver nutrients and moisture to the soil — and
the groundwater table sinks. Hardwoods will not be <span class="t27 hoverable">used</span> in the
replanting, as they require too <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> to mature for commercial

for contemporary forestry is not interested in quality or in longterm investment.

Energy in the forest
The Sun's energy reaches the Earth's surface as a full spectrum of

into creative growth, the various plants absorbing <span class="t1 t2 t18 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">different</span> parts
of the spectrum. The outcome of this is the production of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span>
water, a humus layer teeming with bacterial <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> (which is an efficient counter to pollution), and an overall coolness and feeling of
harmony. In Nature, a function that maintains any system (e.g. a
forest) in a state of stable health and balance is the outer expression of an inner creative force. It is significant that medicinal
plants will grow only in a healthy forest where the biodiversity is

Tree classification
Trees can be classified generally into seven major categories. These
can be subdivided <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">according</span> to latitude, altitude, whether they are
light-demanding or shade-demanding species (the former having a
thick, rough bark and the latter a smooth thin bark), and whether
they are hardwood or softwood, broad-leafed, conifer, evergreen
and so on.
Before we examine trees and their growth in relation to these
categories in more detail, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">let</span> us look at the specific contribution that

During the course of its life, a hundred-year-old tree:
a) Has processed and fixed the amount of carbon-dioxide contained in 18 million cubic metres of natural air in the <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of about 2500 kg of pure carbon (C).

d) Has <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> available for the respiration of <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> and beast 6,600 kg of molecular oxygen (O2).
e) Against the forces of gravity, has drawn from its roots <span class="t27 hoverable">right</span> up to its crown and evaporated into the

The combustion of 100 litres of petrol consumes about 230 kg of oxygen. That is, after a trip of barely
30,000 km (18,640 miles) (9 6 lit/1000 km), this tree's entire 100 year production of oxygen has been
squandered.

then the production through photosynthesis of 1 tonne of oxygen is required.
1 tonne of O2 = the O2 content of 3,620 m3 of air (+15°C at latm)
The photosynthetic production of 1 tonne of oxygen necessitates:
a) The building up of 0.935 tonnes C6H12O6 (carbohydrate),
b) which process requires 1.37 tonnes CO2 (carbon-dioxide) and 0.56 tonnes H2O (water)
c) The transpiration of 230 to 930 tonnes H2O

inner temperature is vital to all trees, as to all organisms. When sunlight penetrates the trunk, the tree's metabolism is disrupted. It
becomes overheated, the sap no longer flows as it should and the
general structure of the tree becomes very coarse, leading to malformations, cancerous growths in the interior, and so on. All shadedemanding trees, and under <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> circumstances light-demanders
too, will do everything they can to maintain or reinstate their preferred inner temperature.
This can be seen after a forest fire, when the trees that survive
quickly cover themselves with a profusion of small shoots. The <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span>

Light-induced growth
You can tell the age of a tree by counting the growth rings across the
cut trunk. These annual rings <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> tell you something about the conditions under which it grew, and about the climatic variations.

for the tree, because it <span class="t0 t2 t16 t18 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">put</span> on more growth; but greater quantity
does not mean better quality. What it actually signifies is a tree
under heat stress. This is best seen in Fig. 14.4; where the rings are
widely spaced on the sunny side of the trunk, the heat caused the
wood to expand; on the shaded side the metabolism has not been
disturbed and the annual rings are close together.
In a tree that grows in the shade with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> soil conditions, the sapducts are virtually straight, producing strong vertical growth, and the

Radar seems to be responsible for the destruction of parts of the
German forest, and the sub-arctic forest in Canada near the line of
Defence Early Warning installations.7 Viktor observed the early evidence of radar damage to trees; however, most of the destructive
effects of microwave pollution have developed since he died.
Microwave transmitters operate with wavelengths between 2cm
and 50cm, exposure to which can inflict biological damage.
Microwaves have an energetically disruptive effect, triggering deteriorating changes in crystal structure. An example of the amount of
free ambient energy being generated can be seen from the use of a
neon-filled tube to test the system's working. Held parallel to the
direction of transmission from a microwave transmitter, or a hightension powerline, its spontaneous ignition confirms the ambient
energy's strength.8

We have noted a correspondence between times in the past
when forests predominated on the Earth, and with major evolutionary surges. It seems that trees have this magical role to fine-tune the
proportion of atmospheric gases, particularly oxygen. The 'normal'
proportions are O2 (oxygen) 20.95%, CO2 (carbon dioxide) 0.3%, N
(nitrogen) 78.08% and rare gases 0.93%, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> recent <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span> have

There is an important relationship between rainwater and trees.
Raindrops absorb atmospheric oxygen, nitrogen and other tracegases in their descent, but their downward spinning movement <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span>
generates intense bioelectric and biomagnetic fields. This creates an
energy potential which is essentially life-endowing. When the raindrops fall on the leaves of the tree, the oxygen and other gases are
absorbed along with the immaterial energies collected, stimulating
activity and growth. For this reason plants respond with <span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">much</span>
greater vitality and activity after a fall of rain than to conventional
systems of irrigation where these gases and energies are virtually
absent, due to the <span class="t6 t9 t18 t26 hoverable">far</span> shorter fall distance.
It has frequently been observed that the planting of trees in arid
or desert conditions causes an increase in rainfall. This is probably
because chemicals that are a by-product of photosynthesis are emitted, which helps to generate clouds.11 This is <span class="t6 t10 t15 hoverable">known</span> to occur in the
tropical rainforests, and it is likely to happen in other particularly
warm areas. It is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of the most interesting feedback mechanisms
that Gaia produces.
When the ground surface is cooler than the air (i.e. it has a positive temperature gradient) rainwater penetrates into the soil. The
free oxygen is gradually absorbed by the surrounding soil, activating micro-organisms in the humus upper layers of the soil. As the
rainwater sinks deeper into the substrata and continues to release
the excess oxygen, it gradually cools towards the +4°C anomaly
point. As we have seen, free hydrogen is now available with which
the now very passive oxygen is able to combine in the cool conditions, giving birth to <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> molecules.
This juvenile immature water, unpolluted by any other substances or ingredients, is born near the temperature when its density is highest, that is, about +4°C (39°F). It begins to rise up
through the various energy-horizons (the most finely differentiated
temperature strata), acquiring increasing 'information' in the <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span>

energies up the tree ('inhaling'), while at night the energy withdraws to the root system (exhaling).
As the sap rises from the ground level, gradually the sap-ducts
and capillaries begin to narrow and the coarser elements in the sap,
unable to rise further, are built into the tree's structure at the point
where their upward movement ceases. As the sap vessels get
smaller, the faster the sap streams both upwards and downwards
and the greater the homeopathic potential. Ultimately only the most
minute particles, which are hardly to be counted as matter, stream
up towards the crown or down to the roots with increasing spiral
gyration, dynamic and energetic effect.
The growth activity is at a maximum at the extremities of crown
and root zones, because all that is active here are the most highly
potentiated homeopathic resonances and amounts of barely structured matter. This upward or downward stream of energy <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> has

Sap movement
Viktor Schauberger has transformed our understanding of the
metabolism of the tree. He showed how the movement of the sap
under the conditions of both natural growth and of unnatural lightinduced growth is determined by the temperature gradient <span class="t5 t7 hoverable">within</span>
the tree itself, and by the external light, heat and cold.
The solution, transport and deposition of nutrients, as we saw in
<span class="t12 t19 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">Chapter</span> 14, are functions of the temperature gradient. Salts and
minerals are precipitated with cooling, when <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> and air are
excluded; however, they are precipitated with heating when exposed
to <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> and air. Under a positive temperature gradient, as the sap
cools towards +4°C (39°F) or is maintained at this temperature, the
<span class="t6 t9 t22 t29 hoverable">highest</span> quality nutrients are precipitated last. Under a strong negative temperature gradient and with <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> and heat, the opposite happens; only the lowest quality nutrients are expelled, the <span class="t6 t9 t22 t29 hoverable">highest</span>
quality not being transported at all.
We saw that the growth of shade-demanding trees takes <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span>
largely in the crown where the air temperature is usually higher
than at ground level. The tree's overall shape is cylindrical, with few
lower branches, because there is no need to protect the trunk
against light. Lacking horizontal lighting, the trunk does not suffer
large temperature fluctuations, so it produces closely <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t15 t17 t18 t19 hoverable">set</span> annual
rings. The temperature in the trunk reduces from the outside
inwards, resulting in an <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> deposition of growth material, which
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t14 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">means</span> high quality and dense timber. These shade-demanders have
a slender girth because of their strong vertical sap movement, high
health and associated levitational energies, that in a mature tree
enables it to withstand gales.
When a shade-demander is planted out in the open it has to cope
with unnatural levels of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> and heat, protecting itself as quickly

tend to grow on the sunny side of the tree, leaving it unbalanced and
misshapen.
In its early years, due to high <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> exposure, a plantation tree
exhibits wide annual rings and abnormal lateral branch growth (see
Fig. 15.1). Once it receives some protection from its neighbours, the
need for lateral branch growth diminishes and it will tend to grow
upwards. However, in commercial woodland, the trees are thinned
after a prescribed period, those considered suitable for use in construction going to the sawmill and the remainder to the pulp-mill.
This thinning out exposes the remaining trees to excess heat and
light. All their growth energy is diverted to growing branches on the
exposed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of the trunk, mainly on the sunny side, which produces knots and twisted, spongy grain.
The annual tree rings tell the story of a tree's exposure to light.
In Fig. 15.1, the rings near the middle show that in its early years,
this 33-year <span class="t25 hoverable">old</span> tree was exposed to unnatural levels of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> and

The conventional theory is that the movement of sap is caused
by osmosis, or by differences in pressure between air pressure and
the pressure in the capillaries. However, the absorbent raising action
of osmosis is limited, and <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">cannot</span> account for the rising of sap in the

the atmosphere. This makes it specifically heavier, exerting pressure through the sand barrier on the other side of the U-tube, causing the

This replicates the natural process of pulsation that happens with all liquids in Nature, a pulsation which is caused by temperature difference,
pressure and suction. This experiment sets out to duplicate particularly the conditions under which sap rises in the daytime (the four capillaries
representing the xylem tubelets), falling back at night <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> (the pair of capillaries approximate the delivery of the phloem tubelets).
To demonstrate the action of a natural spring, the adaptor with four capillaries is removed, leaving the shorter side open, so that the <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span>

through photosynthesis. When the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t14 t23 t25 t28 hoverable">Sun</span> sets and the temperature
drops, this process is reversed as it breathes in oxygen to help build
up the root system and the trunk of the tree. Nightfall initiates the
retreat of the sap, which becomes denser through cooling and is
drawn towards the root-zone. The capillaries in the crown of the
tree are evacuated, creating a partial biological vacuum as the CO2
gas-bubbles condense and begin to sink (see Fig. 15.6).
The CO2, nitrogen, oxygen, starches, sugars, and trace gases
formed during daytime photosynthesis are drawn down through the
minute stomata and pores in the leaves, down the trunk, some of
them reaching the hair-roots. Their purpose here is to nourish the
life-functions of the tree during the night and provide the material
for building the structure of the inner fabric of the tree as a whole.

Temperature gradients in the tree
Temperature gradients are important in tree metabolism. The areas
of active growth in the outer trunk and in the branches need heat
energy to sustain the formative elements in a productive, ionized
and fluid state for the processes of combination and re-combination
to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">take</span> place.
During the daytime, a positive temperature gradient is active
from the outside inwards, the cooler, more internal sap rising faster,
transporting the finest nutrients up to the top of the tree. They are
<span class="t19 hoverable">taken</span> to the foliage, for the small green shoots, flowers and reproductive elements required for the <span class="t6 t9 t22 t29 hoverable">highest</span> quality growth. Viktor
Schauberger's measurements showed that this upward flow <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span>
be as fast as 3m (10ft) per hour, or 50mm (2ins.) per minute. The
lower quality, coarser nutrients present in the outermost layers of
the cambium ring (just inside the bark), needed for building the
structure of the tree, are raised only as <span class="t6 t9 t18 t26 hoverable">far</span> as their fineness permits,
the coarser being deposited in the trunk, the finer later in the
branches. The effectiveness of this process depends on a negative
temperature gradient being active from the outside inwards (cooler

With rising air temperatures, the point where the positive and
negative temperature gradients meet <span class="t5 t7 hoverable">within</span> the tree shifts to deeper
levels. The flow of the sap becomes more sluggish and the positively
charged nutritive elements are held in near stationary suspension at
various heights to await the arrival of the negatively charged elements from above. This <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be the reason why the Amazonian rainforest stops producing oxygen towards midday. The positive
nutrient-transporting temperature gradient soon changes to a negative <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> as the temperatures rise rapidly during the morning. This
arrests the supply of nutrients; photosynthesis ceases and with it,
the expiration of oxygen is interrupted.
With nightfall and the cooling air, the temperature gradient
reverses to positive from the inside outwards, so that the outer layers of the tree <span class="t8 t13 hoverable">become</span> cooler than the inner. The crown cools faster,
causing the sap to sink quickly. The higher temperatures of the
Amazon rainforest <span class="t1 t3 t9 t15 t20 t21 t26 t29 hoverable">cause</span> fast evaporation, to <span class="t22 hoverable">bring</span> accelerated

because of the prevailing positive temperature gradient (Figs. 15.4

Insufficient nutrients are able to reach the crown of the tree, which
is likely to suffer die-back; high quality timber is no longer produced, and the tree will have a limited lifespan. Sprouting foliage
shows the height to which the sap is able to rise.
Because of unnatural high internal temperatures there is premature deposition of nutrients, a condition akin to arterio-sclerosis in the blood vessels of humans. The higher temperature <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span>

The tree as a biocondenser
We discussed earlier how the formative energies (which belong to
the fourth and fifth dimensions) carry the blueprint for the evolution and physical manifestation of all organisms. This life-force carries with it an electrical charge. The process of growth and
development of any organism requires that this life-force is
enhanced or potentiated by a process <span class="t6 t10 t15 hoverable">known</span> as biocondensing.

manner, the annual rings forming the dielectric separators between the
electrically charged areas. When these are closer together, the potential
(the dynamic energy) is increased, which occurs higher up the trunk.

The diameter of the trunk reduces as the tree grows taller, which
makes the annuals rings grow closer together, increasing the bioelectric potential. At the very top of the tree the potential is very high.
Finally in the leaves themselves the energy potential is at its maximum.
This is necessary for the critical process of evapo-transpiration to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">take</span>

In addition, this refinement of the energy at the leaves gives it a
kind of increased homeopathic potency; so that when they receive
the highly energized drops of falling rainwater there is an immediate transfer of pure energy or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> force.

These areas of dense growth where the biocondensers are
located are finely structured and susceptible to damage, either by
being pierced, or disturbed by excessive warming. If this happens,
the biocondenser fails, disease sets in and the tree dies.
By inserting copper probes, Walter Schauberger was able to

Root systems
The root system, being the invisible <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of the tree, has an aura of
mystery. A germinating seed puts down a root into the darkness before
it sends a shoot into the light. The root system is the complement to
the canopy, and its energy exchange system is just as complex.
It is important to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> the <span class="t3 t5 t7 t9 t20 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> tree as an energy pathway that

Out
of this union comes the primary manifestation of the organism,
'tree' — with its secondary life-enhancing processes of chlorophyll
production and photosynthesis.
We are taught wrongly that there is a one-way transport of
nutrients from the roots to the leaves. The very fine root tips, with
their tiny capillaries, correspond to the new, growing leaves in the
tree canopy, and at night the descending energies and nutritive elements contribute to the important processes that these root tips
perform.

and nutritive elements derived from the tree crown, to increase the
vitality of the soil, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> which the micro-organisms <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be
unable to flourish. In addition, they release hydrogen, which combines with free oxygen in the soil to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> birth to <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> water. So it is
clear that these protoplasms perform invaluable functions.
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Even</span> a gardener probably has only the vaguest idea of how a root
system develops. To hold up the plant stem is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> purely physical
function. There is, in fact, the widest possible variety of root forms
and systems, the diversity of which is essential to healthy microenvironment, because each species' roots go down to a <span class="t1 t2 t18 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">different</span>
level in the soil, bringing up <span class="t1 t2 t18 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">different</span> nutrients and energies.
Trees are described as being flat-rooted, heart-rooted, taprooted and deep-rooted, the last evaporating more <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> than
heart-rooted trees, and flat-rooted trees evaporating least of all.
Each plant species, therefore, has its own particular root structure,
which penetrates to a <span class="t1 t2 t18 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">different</span> soil horizon to withdraw the elements it needs. But other plants will share some of these nutrients
also. Fig. 15.7 illustrates the wide variety of root systems.
When plants <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> appeared, about 420 million <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span> ago, climatic
conditions were inhospitable, with severe storms and heavy rain.
Only the most primitive plants <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> gain a hold, feeding on the salts
and metallic minerals. Although they had very little root growth, the
stems above ground were able to trap some nutritive wind-borne
dust to <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> very primitive soil, their shadows having a slight cooling effect on the ground, allowing some moisture to collect.

Soil and nutrition
Cooling was the key to the appearance of water, and as the ground
cover spread, the lowering temperature affected the deeper ground,
allowing the <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> table to rise, bringing with it minerals, trace elements and nutritional substances nearer to the surface. This created
the conditions for higher quality plants to evolve. Requiring better
quality nutrition, these higher plants had deeper root systems that
<span class="t2 t4 t5 t22 t23 hoverable">brought</span> up minerals from a <span class="t1 t2 t18 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">different</span> horizon, but were no competition for the pioneer plants.
The more evolved plants held the soil together, trapping more
moisture that helped to attract micro-bacterial activity to break
down the mineral particles into finer dust, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> step towards the

The root systems <span class="t8 t13 hoverable">become</span> more complex, interweaving at <span class="t1 t2 t18 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">different</span> levels, so that
they <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">cannot</span> easily be separated. Greater fertility brings a richer soil
that is of too high a quality for the pioneer plants, which will now
disappear. A more favorable microclimate in the higher soil
increases the diversity of the bacteria, encouraging more complex
root systems.
There is a magical and symbiotic relationship between the various root systems that we <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">cannot</span> easily observe below ground, more
complex than the interrelationships of the plants above ground.
With greater complexity, and the evolution of trees, the soil takes on
the full yin energy potential of Mother Earth, and with it the <span class="t14 hoverable">creation</span> of virgin water, an essential requirement for higher <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> forms.
This process of soil formation <span class="t4 hoverable">took</span> several million <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span> before
larger plants, such as small bushes and trees, were able to gain a

before a forest was possible. The forest is the most productive environment for the building up of soil and fertile humus. It is self-fertilizing and self-sustaining.

With our heedless disrespect for Nature's bounty, in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> century we have allowed these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> soil banks to be eroded and

very aware of its pitfalls, developing a number of field tests which
demonstrated the fallacy of the <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> technologies. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Though</span> he did

to a large extent he predicted them.
Intensive farming developed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> in the Americas, where the
limitless vast open plains <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> be cultivated or grazed in only very
large units. At <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> in North America, and then on the South American plains, this meant enormous herds of cattle or highly mechanized crop cultivation. Because of the inevitable depletion of
minerals and, as a consequence of monoculture, intensive farming
of this kind soon leads to the widespread use of chemical drugs or
artificial fertilization with animals, and herbicides with cultivation.
By its very <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> intensive agriculture is unsustainable, but it is a
big and profitable international industry and, as we all know, we are
living at a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> where big profits count for more than <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> or ecological values.
There is a growing interest in sustainable cultivation, and
there are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> books on the topic. It is impossible to grow crops

and soil fertility. He had original ideas about fertilization, but his
most intriguing ideas were concerned with amplifying the subtle
energies of the planet to <span class="t22 hoverable">bring</span> about higher quality in the plants
themselves.
16. SOIL FERTILITY AND CULTIVATION

Ploughing methods
Viktor Schauberger's interest in soils was initiated during a visit to
Bulgaria in the 1930s where he had been commissioned to build a
log-flume. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span> Boris asked him to look into the decline in soil productivity and the shrinkage of the <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> table in the northern parts
of the country since the introduction of modern mechanized farming methods. The southern part, on the other hand, was still fertile,
with abundant moisture.
Viktor <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> that in the poorer southern <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of the country,
populated largely by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> of Turkish origin, the fields were
tilled with traditional wooden ploughs pulled usually by teams of
women. These fields remained very fertile and productive, with
high crop quality. In the north, however, the fields were ploughed
with tractor-drawn steel ploughs. As he was aware of the destructive effect that steel and iron have on <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> in the soil,
Schauberger attributed the disappearance of the <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> and the
poorer yields to the use of the steel ploughs and the faster
ploughing in the north. This <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> led him to invent a <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span>
kind of plough and to do a number of experiments on improving
soil fertility. Before going into this, however, we need to understand more about electromagnetism.

Viktor Schauberger2
Viktor observed how steel ploughs damage the soil. Drawn rapidly through the ground, the hard steel ploughshares generate
minute ferro-electric and ferro-magnetic currents that decompose the nutrient-laden <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> molecules in the soil, in a manner
similar to electrolysis, resulting in <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> loss. The surface tension
of the <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> molecule is reduced, the soil loses its energy potential and its nutritive subtle energies are dissipated. This not only
destroys the soil's subtler energies, but <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> converts the nutritive
elements or removes them from the mature <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> molecule. The
residual <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> becomes pure juvenile <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> that has no nutritive
value.
Abrasion with the soil removes tiny particles of steel from the
cutting surface of the plough, which break down to rust, an ideal
breeding ground for harmful pathogenic bacteria. An increase in
the iron content of soil inhibits its <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> retention. On the other
hand, soils high in copper have the capacity to retain greater quantities of water.
The delicate soil capillaries that deliver nutrients and <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> to
the surface, and some of the micro-organisms that process them are
destroyed by the heat-producing friction and the compacting pressure of the steel plough. As the normal supply of nutrients from
below is cut off and the <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> table falls, the soil fertility suffers.
Schauberger started to experiment with copper, initially as a
plating of thick copper over a conventional steel plough. The
destructive ferro-electromagnetic effects of the steel plough were
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> replaced by beneficial bioelectromagnetic ionization, enhancing growth and soil fertility. Because of the remarkable results it
achieved, this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> to be <span class="t6 t10 t15 hoverable">known</span> as the 'Golden Plough.'
Field trials were conducted near Salzburg in 1948 and 1949 to
compare the results of the <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> plough with the conventional steel

energies of the soil had been increased, and the corn stood about
6-8 inches higher with a <span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">much</span> fuller head. Some yields in the
strips ploughed with copper-plated implements increased by up to
40% compared to the control strips where conventional steel
ploughs were used. As all other factors of soil chemistry, orientation, furrow width, etc., were identical, the difference in yield was
clearly due to the use of the copper plated plough.

The Bio-plough
The conventional ploughshare forms a pressure wave and makes a
crushing cut that destroys the soil capillaries. Schauberger in 1948
encouraged a Hamburg engineer Jurgen Sauck to develop a sharp
curved blade to create a <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> slicing cut before the soil is centripetally involuted in a figure of eight motion through the curving

Alignment of furrows
In his study of crop yields in Bulgaria, Viktor Schauberger realized
that there were factors other than the use of steel versus wooden
ploughs to explain the differences in productivity between the
north and south. The fields in the north were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> harrowed, which
broke the soil into <span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">much</span> smaller particles and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> it more vulnerable to drying out in the hot <span class="t0 t8 t11 t14 t23 t25 t28 hoverable">sun</span> to several inches of depth.
In the Turkish south of the country, the farmers <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> not afford
to harrow, and their ploughing was <span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">much</span> more rough and ready.
The furrows they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> were irregular and rough, producing large
clods that fell in <span class="t1 t2 t18 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">different</span> directions. The unevenness of the furrows
meant that there were no large flat surfaces to absorb the heat of the
Sun. This messy looking surface <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> had the advantage of holding
the moisture in the top layers of the soil.
The lesson to be learned from these examples was to cut sinuous furrows so as to vary exposure to the Sun's rays, but in addition

of the furrows <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be shaded for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> and exposed to
the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t14 t23 t25 t28 hoverable">Sun</span> only when it was low in the sky. This meant that the young
growing sprouts had the maximum amount of moisture when most
needed.

Grazing and grass cutting
Conventional mechanical grass mowers have an effect on the grass
similar to that of the standard iron plough on the soil. The inclined
blade uses a crushing action that damages the capillaries of the
grass stalks, and shreds the top of the stalks for several millimetres,
allowing the grass to bleed and bacteria to enter. Instead of applying its energies to <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> growth, the grass stems have to heal the
wounds, which can <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">take</span> a week.

to damage the stalks. It then seals the ends of the stalks with its

soil, but nobody was listening. The rapid spread in the use of artificial fertilizers led to a systematic depletion of soil fertility as it lost
its organic base. A highly mechanized system of cultivation, using
steel ploughs and artificial fertilizers reduced large tracts of midwestern America to dustbowls, forcing the ruined farmers to leave
their land. The same is now happening in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> third <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> countries, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> India, where multinational chemical companies are

In their finely powdered form, artificial fertilizers are moisture
demanding, robbing the lower ground strata and the young plants
of moisture. With insufficient moisture, transpiration is reduced
and the plants' internal temperatures rise, making them more susceptible to disease. These fine powders block the vital capillaries,
which supply naturally derived nutrients, mature water, and conduct rising immaterial energies. This makes it more difficult for the
plants to absorb rain, resulting in rapid runoff and faster re-evaporation. Irrigation, with virtually worthless water, now becomes a
necessity. It is not surprising that the crops grown in such conditions are <span class="t4 t18 t22 hoverable">neither</span> particularly tasty nor nourishing.

The health of the topsoil is the most important factor in sustainable
agriculture. Topsoil is created by decayed vegetable matter, and can
vary in depth from a few centimetres to several metres.

Under natural conditions the friable soil is populated with an
abundance of earthworms and other creatures and is usually
capped with a layer of humus, formed of decomposing leaves and
other vegetable matter, and colonized by a profusion of microbial
and creepy-crawly life. This rich mixture of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> forms makes up a
processing factory essential to soil health and fertility, and everything should be done to help it flourish.

Soil remineralization
In 1894 an agricultural chemist and contemporary of Justus von
Liebig, Julius Hensel, published Bread from Stone, a valuable <span class="t25 hoverable">book</span>
describing the beneficial effects of fertilizing with rock dust, a byproduct of road metal quarries. His book, posing a significant threat
to this <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> chemical fertilizer industry, quickly disappeared,
bought up and killed off by those who felt challenged by it.
Ideally ground in a cold process that retains its inherent energies, this rock dust in composed of finely ground, mainly igneous
rocks (such as granite, basalt, etc.) with a broad mineral spectrum.
Because of its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> range of minerals, trace elements and salts,
when spread on the ground, it encourages a wealth of <span class="t1 t2 t18 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">different</span>
micro-organisms.
There has been limited use of rock dust in Switzerland for 150
years. However, its reintroduction has been encouraged by John
Hamaker and Don Weaver who in 1975 <span class="t2 t4 t5 t22 t23 hoverable">brought</span> out The Survival of
Civilization.1 They describe how important are mineral and trace

Hamaker was able to increase the depth of the topsoil at his Michigan home, from about 10cm (4in) to about 1.2m (4ft) over a period
of 10 years.
More recently in Western Australia, an experiment by Barry Oldfield for the 'Men of the Trees' showed a remarkable increase in the
growth and health of seedlings planted with rock dust compared
with those without. Rock dust is easily available as a by-product of
road metal quarries.
An initial application of very fine rock dust will quickly attract
micro-organisms, but a mixture of small and large grains will allow
a slow release over a longer period. Rock dust has been shown to be
a buffer against nitrate, sulphur dioxide and nitroxide, and it
absorbs and fixes the negative ions while saving the positive ions
for the plants' use. Normally rock dust is applied about <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> five

bowls full, clearly knew what was best for them.

Organic farming
Organic farming normally uses manure (generally cow's), farmyard
slurry and composted vegetable matter to increase the soil's fertility. The introduction of chemical fertilizers in the nineteenth century was popular and soon supplanted the traditional organic
method, because it was <span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">much</span> less labour intensive, and appeared to
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> higher crop yields. A few farmers retained the traditional methods and, as the evidence has built up of the pollution of the <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span>
table and rivers by these chemicals, there has been a renaissance of
organic farming in the last fifty years.
The sustainability of organic farming derives from the recycling
of organic material to maintain its fertility, just as in a natural forest. Modern organic composting tends to use green vegetable matter rather than dried, interleaved with layers of earth. Significant

heat discourages earthworms, it will not be of the best quality. His
preference is a cold process that produces a higher content of protein and other immaterial, fructigenic energies. He <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> believed it
important to protect the compost from element-hungry juvenile
rainwater that will tend to leach out some of the nutrients.
Although shown here on a small scale, the same principle can be
applied to larger compost heaps. Schauberger preferred an eggshaped compost heap built up under a large fruit-tree with a broad
canopy as shown in Fig. 17.1.
A hollow is dug out of the ground round the base of the tree <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whose</span>

not only protect the tree but, once decomposed, provide an air duct
for ventilation. Into the hollow is placed a 20cm thick layer of Sundried leafmould and vegetable matter. This is covered with an equally
thick mixture of earth, river gravel and fine sand. This is similar to
remineralization, just described. A small amount of copper and zinc
filings is added to this mixture (see p. 232).
To stop the compost heap getting wet, it is then temporarily covered with clay or some other waterproof material. Insects, earthworms, and micro-organisms are quickly attracted into the heap
because it is a cool process. Helped by the diffused oxygen, nitrogen
and other trace gases penetrating the newspaper round the trunk
and the layer of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> and sand, they begin to break down the
refuse.
The heap is built up into the stable shape of the egg shown in
Fig. 17.1, as more vegetable refuse becomes available. To protect the
cold decomposition from being spoiled by rain, the finished heap
is then coated with a layer of clay. Any rain will run down the near
vertical surfaces.
The earthworms and microbes will now have multiplied in their
thousands through the <span class="t3 t5 t7 t9 t20 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> pile and aerated it. As they will begin
to die off, their bodies add nutritive value to the compost heap, having by now infiltrated the <span class="t3 t5 t7 t9 t20 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> of the compost heap. As the autumn
<span class="t0 t8 t11 t14 t23 t25 t28 hoverable">Sun</span> loses its strength, the ground starts to cool and a significant
positive temperature gradient is established between the ground
and the air. The compost heap is now ready; it is <span class="t19 hoverable">taken</span> down to
ground level, and what remains in the cavity is left to nourish the
tree.
The material is spread evenly over adjacent fields towards
evening, for under the positive temperature gradient — most powerful at this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> — rain or dew will carry the nutrients into the
ground. This method produces a <span class="t6 t9 t18 t26 hoverable">far</span> richer and higher-quality natural fertilizer, which not only maintains, but actually increases fertility. The host tree <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> benefits and will produce a copious crop of

Biodynamic farming
Dr Rudolf Steiner (1861-1925), a teacher and philosopher born in
Austria, and founder of the Anthroposophical Movement, devised
biodynamic farming. <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">According</span> to anthroposophy the <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> being

The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> is
studied through the inner and outer natures of humanity. Its
approach to farming is very similar to Schauberger's, the assumption
that energy is the primary cause, and growth the secondary effect.
While it has been mooted that Rudolf Steiner and Viktor
Schauberger did have fairly lengthy discussions, if such was the case,
it is not clear how <span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">much</span> either <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t18 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">might</span> have influenced the other.
Biodynamic farming recognizes the very ancient practice of
burying cow's horns filled with cow dung deep underground in the
autumn. At this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> the active Earth's energies are drawn into the
horn because of its vortex shape, transforming its contents into
powerful fructigenic energies by the cold process of fermentation
encouraged by the low temperatures. The cow horns are disinterred
in early spring, their contents having been converted into a sweet
smelling, highly active substance.
This empowered material is the basis of the natural fertilizer
<span class="t6 t10 t15 hoverable">known</span> as '500 mix.' Since 1947, it has been increasing widely used,
and over a 1 1/4 million acres are fertilized in Australia using this system. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">land</span> where it has been spread, when seen from the air,

This method of progressively raising energy is analogous to the

cools. It is then further heated to incandescence, folded over on
itself, fused <span class="t16 t21 hoverable">together</span> and beaten out again. Each <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> the heating

attuned to these immaterial energies. Viktor Schauberger undoubtedly was, as were other visionaries, such as Goethe and Rudolf

dimensional energies. Viktor Schauberger identified these aspects
of the Sun's fertilizing role (the <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> driving force of life),
<span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">according</span> to their <span class="t1 t2 t18 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">different</span> purposes in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Nature</span> (as described in
<span class="t12 t19 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">Chapter</span> 2). Dynagens generate higher intrinsic energy; fructigens
are those subtle energies that produce greater fertility; qualigens
create greater quality. Schauberger believed that there was no more
powerful <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> to stimulate high quality growth than by seeding
these dynamic energies directly on the soil. As in any area of creativity, the balance of the positive and negative, the male and female
energies are all-important.
The Tibetans, who had a practice to bury so-called 'treasure
vases,' knew <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> ago about the seeding of the soil with immaterial
energies in <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> propitious places. Filled with precious stones
and metals, these containers were believed to discharge beneficial
energies that enhanced and protected the environment. The
Tibetans believed that gold and other precious metals were best left
undisturbed in the ground as they help to balance the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> energy,
just as the Hopis and the Australian aborigines regard places with
uranium as sacred.
Schauberger's vision was to create a greater abundance of creative animating energy, of fertility and rising quality. To do this
involved a process that sounds more alchemical than scientific. It

As a container he <span class="t27 hoverable">used</span> an egg-shaped fermentation chamber

the pivotal +4°C (39°F) anomaly point due to the vortical movement in the liquid. The egg-shape ensures that the particles are

In terms of homeopathic principles and attempts to produce

darkness before an <span class="t29 hoverable">ever</span> more powerfully flaring and heatless
flame, which threw a pale glimmer into the surroundings. At

mysterious egg-light sprang up. When I noticed that this shaft

surrounding soil. This, however, had no effect.
Then I held my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t29 hoverable">hand</span> in this egg-light and instead of

saw the bones standing out on my hand. An icy chill ran
down my back. I returned to the tree where my gun lay,
released the safety catch and sat down in my former bivouac,
waiting to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> what else <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> happen.

the sky at last began to grey. A few hundred metres <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">away</span> the
gamecock began his courtship, the actual reason for my early
visit. I didn't move from my position, watching how this
uncanny glow slowly extinguished, and suddenly the <span class="t3 t5 t7 t9 t20 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span>
specter was over.
When at last daylight came, I returned again to the source
of the flame and on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> tip of the lush green leaves I saw
oversize dewdrops, again in egg-shaped form, standing

down.
Now I began to dig into the hillock with the tip of my
mountain staff and underneath a peculiarly smelling layer of
humus, I felt a resistance, which after further digging, turned
out to be the almost undecomposed corpse of a chamois
buck, which had a clearly distinguishable bullet entry hole
above the left foreleg. There was, however, no exit hole.
<span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">According</span> to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of year, it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> have been shot only by

slow decomposition rather than putrefaction takes place. Sick

equally warm or cold in winter and in summer, seeking either
a cure or a painless death. Expressed scientifically, constant

explained, the high clergymen had themselves buried in a

priests at least had a little roof built over their graves along
the cemetery wall at the eastern side in <span class="t0 t6 t7 t8 t11 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">order</span> to protect them
from rainwater. I realized later that, because of its free oxygen
content, which activates decomposive forces, rainwater
actually promotes decay or rusting.10

Fertilizing energies
Schauberger's buried fermentation chamber is sited so as to be a
meeting <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> for the male seminal energies of the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t14 t23 t25 t28 hoverable">Sun</span> (acting perpendicularly to the Earth) and the female fertilizing energies of the

The
residues or fallout of their combination result in physical growth. As
Schauberger describes:
Having been created out of the most thoroughly rotted elements
of former life, these emanations are the most natural fertilizers,
which have metamorphosed their erstwhile spatiality (spatial
volume) to such a degree, that they can only manifest themselves as highly dosed (concentrated) energetic matter.11
This is what sustainability is all about. Matter being the energetic
waste products of higher (fourth or fifth dimensional) energies created through heat and light, their reconversion into energies <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span>
them the best possible natural fertilizers. There is virtually no limit
to the charge that can be built up with these energies, as they are
nonspatial.
The fertilizing energies (which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be a combination of dynagens, fructigens and qualigens) enter the plant itself through the
root protoplasms, the little sacs or vesicles of proto-water or amniotic fluid attached to the root-tip. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Like</span> dew, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">another</span> <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of protowater formed on the tips of blades of grass during the night and
early morning, these vesicles, too, collapse if exposed to <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> and
heat. This is why the greatest care <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> be <span class="t19 hoverable">taken</span> when replanting
small seedlings or saplings, which should be done only at night in
<span class="t0 t6 t7 t8 t11 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">order</span> to keep injury to a minimum.
Absolutely essential to the plant, these delicate root protoplasms
convert the nutritive energies and the minerals into a <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> that it
can absorb. Viktor Schauberger's sketch (Fig. 17.4) illustrates the
process, which he describes:
HIDDEN <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">NATURE</span>

No plant is actually nourished by dissolved matter, but rather
by the nutritive entities of geospheric origin, 'ascended' in a
fourth dimensional state. These diffuse ethericities can enter
the sap-stream only through the root protoplasms, where they
are fertilized by diffuse oxygenic ethericities. The higher outbirth of this emulsion (ur-procreation) is an ethericity that
belongs to fifth dimension. These concentrations of matterenergy emit negative, hyper-charged emanations in all directions and bind the positively-charged ethericities entering
through the skin or the bark. Some of this emulsion solidifies
and whatever is subsequently manifested, is what we call
'growth.'12
With these natural methods of fertilization there is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> <span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">much</span>
that we can do to promote healthy and sustainable growth in agriculture. With this technology we have the ability to restore the soil,
our only source of wholesome food, to its former state of high productivity and fertility, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> to increase it.

only <span class="t6 t9 t18 t26 hoverable">far</span> cheaper than the use of harmful artificial fertilizers and
noxious pesticides, but they increase both the quantity and quality
of food. Schauberger held that conversion of agricultural practice to
sustainable organic fertility, forestry to biodiversity and <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span>

Because Podkletnov's invention was inspired by Viktor
Schauberger's research, it <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t18 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">might</span> be interesting to follow how his discovery of anti-gravity <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> from devices he had developed through
observing Nature.

The beginnings of implosion research
During the 1920s, Viktor Schauberger had <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> a bit of money (as
<span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t8 t10 t12 t13 t14 t17 t19 t23 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> as a reputation) by building his revolutionary log flumes. This
enabled him to design a prototype <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> plant to extract energy
directly from air and water, based on the powerful energies he had
identified in Nature. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> experiments he undertook with a
Viennese engineer, Dr Winter, in 1931-32 were inconclusive, and

made him realize he had to undertake <span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">much</span> more precise observations of how the trout actually transmutes the energies of the
stream into such powerful forward motion.
The principle of the trout turbine was that air and <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> should
be directed through spiral shaped pipes with a specially shaped
cross section that moved the substance in such a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> as to transform it into a 'living' state. After a <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> number of revolutions the
air or <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be induced through a specific corkscrew motion
into a highly energized state, from which the energy <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> be
released. What Schauberger was producing was a reaction at the
atomic level. However, instead of violently compressing atoms in
hydrogen gas to create helium and an energy release, he was able to
twist all the elements <span class="t16 t21 hoverable">together</span> in the quiet, but powerful, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> that
happens in Nature; this was more comparable to atomic 'fusion.'
As we have seen, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of Viktor's brilliant insights into Nature's
methods was the concept of reciprocity. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Many</span> of Nature's processes
depend on the alternating of complementary, but opposite, forms of
energy, e.g heat and cold, gravity and levitation, electricity and
magnetism, centrifugence and centripetence, both aspects of which
combine to create a wholeness through their synthesizing, reciprocal action. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> he <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> that alternating pressure and suction
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> be employed in this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> on the axis of the machine to produce
a powerful propulsive effect.
This 'biotechnical' fusion created what Schauberger <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> 'diamagnetic' or higher quality substances which had levitational tendencies that were the principal feature of the machines he designed
at the beginning of the war. The first, built by a Berlin company in
1940, disappointed him because of the poor workmanship. So he
moved assembly closer to home, to a Viennese plant where, in an
unscheduled test, his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> flying saucer-shaped prototype broke
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">away</span> from its anchoring bolts and smashed a hole in the factory's
ceiling. The infuriated owner <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> forgave Schauberger and was
uncooperative about testing a <span class="t6 hoverable">second</span> model.
The German culture has a reputation for being open to <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span>
ideas. Indeed, a German industrialist who had heard about
Schauberger's strange inventions recommended him to Hitler in
1934. Viktor <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> a strong impression on the Fuhrer who, after the
interview, requested all assistance be <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> to his research in fuelless energy production. The scientific establishment resented this
upstart; indeed, the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t28 hoverable">father</span> of quantum physics, Max Planck, who
HIDDEN <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">NATURE</span>

had been present at the interview, when asked his opinion of
Schauberger's theories, retorted: 'Science has <span class="t15 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">nothing</span> to do with
Nature.'
Professor Ernst Heinkel, who developed the innovative aircraft
that bore his name, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> heard about Schauberger's revolutionary

attempted in 1938 to incorporate it into his <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> jet aircraft, the
under-performing HE 280. Heinkel persuaded the patents office to
restrict Schauberger's technology to <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> purification projects, so
that he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be free to develop Schauberger's innovations in his
aircraft research. However, it dawned on him that the conventional
aircraft frame was totally inappropriate for Schauberger's suction
engine. The development in 1940 of Schreiver's 'Flying Top' in
Heinkel's Rostock factory suggests that he had more success when
the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> generator was transferred to the <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> model of prototype
flying saucer.
In 1943, the Schreiver saucer and its subsequent developments
were moved to a secret location in Czechoslovakia to which
Schauberger was from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> seconded. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">Word</span> of this <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> 'aircraft' reached Himmler's ears; he was drawn more to unconventional science as a source of <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> weapons development. Viktor's
activities were at that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> highly secret, moving from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> project
to another, but he was apparently not at that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> responsibility for research and development. However, in 1943 Himmler
entrusted to the SS the role for developing German secret weapons.
The SS established production facilities for these <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> secret
weapons in giant cave complexes in Poland and Czechoslovakia,
safe from Allied bombs, using prisoners of war as labour. Had these
underground facilities been <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t15 t17 t18 t19 hoverable">set</span> up earlier in the war, its outcome
<span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t18 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">might</span> have been different. The level of secrecy was extremely high;
so much, indeed, that at <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> crucial location at the <span class="t7 t10 t15 t25 hoverable">end</span> of the war,
the SS lined up 62 of the scientists and laboratory technicians, and
shot them, to save the secrets of that complex 'free energy' atomic
installation falling into the hands of the approaching Soviet troops.1
The SS decided in 1944 that Schauberger's machines were ready
for production. They drafted him and ordered him, under pain of
death, to employ prisoner engineers from the Mauthausen concentration camp near Linz to develop five projects. In addition to the
high priority flying saucer programme, there was a <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> purifier,

biosynthesize hydrogen from water. However, because of the success of the Allies' bombing, Schauberger moved his operations to
Leonstein in Upper Austria, and the improved Repulsine was
finally ready for testing the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> the Americans arrived; the SS

A British engineer, John Frost, who emigrated to Canada shortly
after the war, developed a flying saucer project <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the Avrocar at
a Canadian aerospace plant, funded largely by US capital. It was to
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">take</span> off and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">land</span> vertically, and to fly at high altitudes at 1,500 mph.
They were having trouble with its stability and, realizing that the

generous offer to buy his propulsion system. Viktor declined,
because they refused to promise that his invention <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be <span class="t27 hoverable">used</span>
only for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> of humanity. Schauberger reported that he had a
<span class="t6 hoverable">second</span> offer of $3.5 million from an American company, which he
refused for the same reason. This was not <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> before the Gerchsheimer consortium contacted him.

The American consortium
Karl Gerchsheimer, initiator of the American consortium that tried
(see p. 13) to extract Schauberger's secrets in 1958, as head of all
civilian administration and logistics had been the most powerful
non-military presence in the U.S. zone of Germany from 1945 to
1950. He was a Bavarian who <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> he understood where
Schauberger was coming from — he had read some of Viktor's
papers, and felt he shared the same <span class="t7 hoverable">love</span> of the mountains and their
pure water.

Donner had a disagreement with Donner's financial adviser, Norman Dodd, their production director, whom they fired in contentious circumstances. Viktor eventually became convinced,
probably mistakenly, that the consortium was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of a U.S. government plan to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> a very powerful atomic bomb by developing his

Basically, they had <span class="t1 t2 t18 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">different</span> agendas; the Schaubergers, Gerchsheimer and Dodd all gave varying accounts of what actually
happened. Gerchsheimer complained that Viktor's explanations of
his theories were unintelligible and suspected that they were flawed.
He gradually <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> to the conclusion that Viktor <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> not be able

The Wright Brothers' plane a century ago had wings, a tail fin and

aerospace companies in the U.S.A. were undertaking research in the
early 1950s. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">One</span> researcher, Townsend T. Brown had designed a

government.
It <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> happened; or did it? All discussion about anti-gravity
ceased in the U.S. in 1957. But that was the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> when the research

underground, or'black' as the popular idiom has it, becoming completely unaccountable to government, with astronomical procurement budgets carefully hidden from the scrutiny of the legislative
branch. This was justified for reasons of national security during
the Cold War, and so it has remained <span class="t29 hoverable">ever</span> since. In fact, America was
following the example of Nazi Germany, where the initiative for
developing <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> weapons was <span class="t19 hoverable">taken</span> from the armaments industry
in 1943 and entrusted to a very secret (mostly literally underground) programme run by the SS.
There have been various reports of secret aircraft being developed by the black side of the U.S. aeronautical industry. The most
noteworthy was the triangular-shaped Northrop B-2 Stealth
Bomber which has an electrogravic drive system; it had followed the
Lockheed Stealth Fighter (the term 'stealth' signifying their invisibility to radar). Some believe that the B-2 has a system to reduce
gravity; what is more accepted is that it envelops itself in a shield of
static electricity which both acts <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> a cloaking device and reduces
its air resistance. Since the B-2 <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> operational in 1993, twenty
have been built at a cost of $20 billion each.2
It has been suggested that test flights of experimental flying
saucer aircraft <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> account for UFO sightings. While this is certainly
possible, evidence is still lacking of the significant development of a

tangible, despite continuing and complex official denials and disinformation campaigns.3
Nick Cook, in his <span class="t25 hoverable">book</span> The Hunt for Zero Point, comes to the conclusion that the giant aerospace industry is essentially conservative.

He subsequently admitted that his father, a leading authority in
hydro-engineering, had acquired original Schauberger papers at the

<span class="t0 t2 t16 t18 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">put</span> into practice. Viktor Schauberger was no exception. Realizing
that the machines our technology has developed are not only very
inefficient, but that they are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> largely responsible for the destruction of our environment, he <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t15 t17 t18 t19 hoverable">set</span> about designing appliances which
<span class="t27 hoverable">used</span> Nature's creative methods, but which were capable <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> of producing vastly more <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> at little cost.
Schauberger abandoned the Euclidean model of straight line
and circle. All the functional surfaces of his machines employ the
spirals, sinuosity and curves of the open forms of non-Euclidean
geometry that are <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> in Nature. The egg-shapes and spirals that
he employed produced life-affirming energies that stabilize,
enhance and rehabilitate natural processes.
When Schauberger designed his prototype machines it was
extremely difficult to perfect complex curvilinear surfaces. Now,
with computer programmes, it is possible with ease to replicate
Nature's eggs, spirals and vortices. A design breakthrough to
designing benevolent systems <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be theoretically simple; what
is lacking is the insight and the imagination.
During the 1930s and 1940s, he developed a number of prototypes: of a machine which produced high quality spring water, a
domestic air conditioning appliance, and various machines which
produced prodigious amounts of motive power. All these machines
worked on <span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">much</span> the same principles, and had in common a virtually silent and inexpensive operation. All the important elements of
Nature's repertoire <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> into their own, such as male and female
ethericities, creative vortical movement, temperature gradients,

Bathtub suction is powered by gravity, which is related to centrifugence, the complement to centripetence.

This is created by spinning the gas or liquid at high speed in a

However, if air containing an average amount of <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> vapour is used, the amount of compaction of

In 1939 the American airship the Akron was destroyed when its
helium mysteriously reverted to water, reducing in volume 1800fold in a massive implosion. This immense reduction in volume creates a biological vacuum that can be an ideal and environmentally
harmless source of motive power. Gases are converted into <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span>

Viktor Schauberger demonstrated how to remove matter from the
physical dimension, and to pack the resulting nonspatial otherworldly vacuum with almost unlimited amounts of pure, formative
energy, the counterpart to the physical substance that had been
transformed. Simply the appropriate trigger, usually <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> or heat,

Nuclear fusion
The dichotomy between centrifugal and centripetal technologies is
<span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> clearer than with nuclear energy. Viktor frequently inveighed
against the dangers of nuclear fission (explosive), and he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> near
to the unveiling the secrets of nuclear fusion (implosive), the
Shangri-la of our technical age. The key to it was the extreme biological vacuum, achieved most nearly in his 'flying saucer,'
described later. The process can be described as 'cold fusion.'

Instead, Baker <span class="t2 t4 t5 t22 t23 hoverable">brought</span> Walter to England in 1950 to lecture to
and dialogue with top scientists. First, at Oxford, there was a gathering of physicists, chemists and forestry researchers, who affected
polite interest, but refrained from comment. However, at Cambridge
Sir James Chadwick, who with Rutherford had <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> split the atom,

A group of top atomic physicists at Birmingham showed lively

weeks later Baker was again in Birmingham, and asked the scientists if they had held a postmortem on Schauberger's presentation.
'Yes, indeed,' they admitted; they had decided that it was 'unchallengeable.' 'Then what are you going to do about it?' asked Baker.
'Nothing,' was their retort.'Why not?' 'Because it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> mean rewriting all the textbooks in the world.'10

duplicating the negatively and positively charged longitudinal vortices at the bends of naturally flowing rivers. It was inevitable that

cold oxidation takes place, allowing the assimilation of the trace elements and minerals.

then left to stand in a cold temperature for 24 hours. The water,
when sipped slowly straight from the egg at a temperature of not
more than 8°C (46°F) will neutralize any over-acidity in the body,

wrote, 'I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> heard of this event only after the war through

a friend, dated the 2nd August 1956, Schauberger commented,'The machine was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to have been destroyed just

This was a <span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">much</span> larger version of a 20cm diameter <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> that Viktor

contained a small high speed electric motor capable of producing
up to 20,000rpm at which point the auto-rotation of the centripulser was initiated. 'This machine generated such a powerful
levitational force, that when it was started (in Viktor's absence), it
sheared the six quarter-inch diameter high-tensile steel anchor
bolts and shot upwards to smash against the roof of the hangar.'13

As the velocities produced by the centripulsing process increase,
the air molecules <span class="t8 t13 hoverable">become</span> cooler and more condensed through the
interaction of both centripetral and centrifugal forces. The reduction in volume <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> reach 1/816, when air is converted into water,

Callum Coats in his fourth volume of the Eco-Technology series,
Energy Evolution, brings <span class="t16 t21 hoverable">together</span> Viktor Schauberger s notes, comments and discussions that have survived the appropriation of the
Soviet and American authorities. In that fascinating volume the
machines discussed are the Air-turbine machine, Water-driven and
Air-driven implosion machines, the Repulsator, the Klimator and the
Repulsine. Sadly, the <span class="t2 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t20 t24 t29 hoverable">text</span> often refers to sketches that are missing.
The Air-turbine machine created an artificial thunderstorm,
operating on the principle of the tornado. Schauberger envisaged
this as a fuel-less silent engine to <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> an aircraft by creating a

designed a submarine using a water-driven implosion motor. The
Klimator was a cooling or heating machine designed for domestic
air conditioning.
There is no doubt that Viktor Schauberger produced a number
of impressive and highly innovative machines for various purposes,
and we have eye witness accounts of the operation of some, as <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t8 t10 t12 t13 t14 t17 t19 t23 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span>
as some of his notes. However, any prototypes or working models
were either destroyed in Germany during the war, or were expropriated from his flat by the Russians who <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> occupied Vienna, or confiscated by the Americans when they overran the Leonstein <span class="t9 t16 t26 hoverable">works</span>

Viktor was a natural scientist and visionary who challenged the
very worldview of a culture that considers itself to be at the apex of
<span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> achievement. His is not a political view, nor a particularly
moral one. He was continually exasperated by the literal blindness
of those in power, their inability to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> what was before their very
eyes.1
Viktor Schauberger's observations and vision have <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> us the
keys to disentangling the environmental mess we have got ourselves
into. His insights were not limited to technology and how we do
things, but to all of life. If we were able to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> that our education,
social organization, philosophy, religions, medicine and science
were all based on seeing only a part-world, we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have a sense

If humanity does not soon <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> to its senses, and realize

these institutions and individuals, <span class="t29 hoverable">ever</span> protective of their

A host of so-called experts is lined up against any
systematic attempt to correct these errors. They are obliged to
advocate the course they have championed, because it is their

malaise arising from flawed principles and perverse
practices. It reveals such grave cultural, technological and
economic violations that no branch of industry is left
untouched. Not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> a partially unaware expert can absolve

At the outset a powerful opposition <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> be reckoned

should <span class="t1 t3 t9 t15 t20 t21 t26 t29 hoverable">cause</span> no alarm, for we are not concerned here with
the livelihood of a few, but with the survival of the <span class="t3 t5 t7 t9 t20 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> of
hoodwinked humanity. The attitude of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> of our young

is still morally healthy. They militate vehemently against the
signs of decay emerging everywhere and refuse to continue to
trot mindlessly down the road... that has led us into an
economic and cultural cul-de-sac.
Opposition alone, however, achieves nothing. Our youth
will achieve any practical success in their struggle only when
the causes are identified and the errors are revealed that

and for the animal and plant kingdoms. These are not moral observations of humankind, but <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of a detached view of why we are

In <span class="t12 t19 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">Chapter</span> Two, you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> remember, when we discussed how all
material objects are composed of atoms and particles in constant
motion, it becomes possible to understand that everything is
energy. There are <span class="t1 t2 t18 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">different</span> kinds of energy; thoughts and feelings
are energy. Energy has qualities as <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t8 t10 t12 t13 t14 t17 t19 t23 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> as frequency. Energies and
actions of differing qualities affect each other favourably or
adversely. For example, the crucial ingredients of the <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> being's
gift of free will are intention and commitment. The quality of the
intention (self-important/greedy or loving/compassionate) affects
the quality of all our actions and their outcomes. Healing of any
kind or at any level is affected by the quality of the healer's energy.
In one's experience this becomes quite clear, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> apparently it is
beyond the ken of contemporary science. Viktor Schauberger was
amazed that this basic <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> was not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of our education.
Viktor was attuned to the wider field of knowledge, and felt that
our educational system greatly contributes to our society's limited
worldview. He did not specifically write about this topic, but the following quote from a recent study very <span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">much</span> sums up what he felt,
and helps us to understand where <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> have to change:
Our much-vaunted educational system specializes in instilling the known. There is a token and often grossly insufficient
acknowledgment of the process of knowing. The knower is
the Cinderella of almost <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> educational system. Self-awareness is actually obscured by conventional education, which
cultivates a mentality of splitting, separating and compartmentalizing. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Knowledge</span> is gained of separate disciplines
which are greatly divorced from the knower, isolated from

What of the future?
Viktor Schauberger realized that the <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> community had little

inevitable reckoning that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Nature</span> will require of humanity. He had a
rather touching faith in the ability of the younger generation to
overthrow the oligarchies of power. However, in the last fifty years,
the ability of a controlled media, especially television, to manipulate
and undermine cultural behaviour, and the apparent irreversibility
of the drug culture, have discouraged hope of initiatives coming
from the young.4

capitalism, for state ownership of industry has not always proved
particularly workable.
The other structure with which we seem to be saddled is socalled democracy, which despite its name, has proved to be nearly
as corrupt a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> of centralizing <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> as any totalitarian system.

Appendix
Implementing Schauberger's vision
It is clear that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> are now responding to Viktor's call to <span class="t8 t13 hoverable">become</span>
familiar with Nature's laws and to <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t7 t10 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> with them. They are recognizing that this is the only <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> to start turning back from the terminal disasters that otherwise surely await humankind. As with any
significant changes of consciousness in <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> history, a few pioneers <span class="t8 t13 hoverable">become</span> the leaven through which all of society starts to wake
up and, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> a cosmic shift, the awakening becomes unstoppable.
What follows are examples of what these pioneers are up to. For
the most <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> these are very practical projects, often to do with

these innovations often have in common is the influence of the spiral or of vortex energy. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> area that is missing is that of implosive energy generation. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Without</span> Viktor's models and detailed
drawings, it is hard to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> how anyone can crack that nut, unless
someone in American or Russian <span class="t20 hoverable">intelligence</span> leaks some vital notes
(as with Evgeny Podkletnov).
There is, however, the theory of spontaneous or synchronistic
origination, which some claim accounted for the simultaneous
discovery of electricity and other significant technical breakthroughs. When the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> is <span class="t27 hoverable">right</span> and the need is great, perhaps
some higher <span class="t20 hoverable">intelligence</span> with a concern for <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> evolution has
cooperated through <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Nature</span> to sow simultaneously the necessary

SWEDEN
Olof Alexandersson is a Swedish engineer who became interested in
Viktor Schauberger's research in 1956 and wrote the excellent introductory <span class="t25 hoverable">book</span> Living Water: Viktor Schauherger and the Secrets of
Natural Energy. He did not meet Viktor, but developed a friendship

with his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> Walter and met <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> of Viktor's <span class="t25 hoverable">old</span> friends and colleagues. In 1963 he formed the Swedish Science Group for Biotech nical Technology which produced (among other devices) an
'apparatus for biological synthesis of spring water,' which was similar to Viktor's Repulsator.
This important research is being carried on today by the Institute for Ecological Technology (IET) in Malmo, Sweden. IET was
formed by Olof Alexandersson as a foundation to continue the
<span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t7 t10 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> of Biotechnical Technology. In the early 1980s IET organized
an expedition to the Ouluanka <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Nature</span> national park in Finland. Its
aim was to verify Viktor's observations in an untouched natural
environment. Later, IET replicated Schauberger's 'double <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> jets'
experiment and (see p. 99) continued to <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t7 t10 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> with the Repulsator.
Today IET is run as an association which evaluates, develops and
applies Viktor Schauberger's ideas and theories. It operates a loose network, the IET-community, to help anyone who has an idea for a
research project in the area, and runs networking seminars. IET helped
with the organization of International Workshops for Natural Energies
(IWONE 2001) in Leipzig and IWONE 2003 near Malmo, Sweden.
IET (which was <span class="t6 t10 t15 hoverable">known</span> as the 'Malmo group') has replicated
Schauberger's Stuttgart experiments, interpreting them in the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span>

AUSTRIA

After his <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t28 hoverable">father</span> died, Walter Schauberger <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t15 t17 t18 t19 hoverable">set</span> up, in 1962, the
Pythagoras Kepler School (PKS) at Engleithen in the Salzkammergut mountains of Upper Austria (Fig. A.l). Walter was a physicist and mathematician, and <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t15 t17 t18 t19 hoverable">set</span> out to validate mathematically his
father's research.6 His particular interests were harmonic theories
(the monochord) and conceptions of non-Euclidean geometry
(plane sections of a hyperbolic cone). He <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> published his
research; however, Callum Coats, who studied with Walter at the
PKS, is currently writing up some of Walter's work. It was intended
that Walter's eldest son, a lawyer, Dr Tilman Schauberger should
succeed him at the PKS but, in the event, Tilman died shortly after
his father's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> in 1994.

In 1967 the terms 'environmental pollution and 'environmental

demanded a gentle technology, friendly to Nature. In that year Walter Schauberger, a scientist who was then a 'lone voice,' gave a lecture on 'Biologically Oriented Technology,' in the centre of the
heavily polluted Ruhr (the main coal mining area of Germany).
Inspired by Walter's message, Norbert Harthun, and a few other specialists, persuaded Walter to join the Gruppe der Neuen in Aachen
to promote a technology that conformed with Nature's laws. The
Group <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> decided to launch their own scientific bulletin Mensch

basins, arranged on sloping ground, to stimulate a <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> flow into

Wilkes studied projective geometry under the distinguished
mathematician George Adams, joining him at the Institut fur Stromungswissenschaften (Flow Research Institute) at Herrischried in
Germany, where he later collaborated with Theodor Schwenk (see
Sensitive Chaos). It is tempting to believe that Schauberger's insights
about <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> probably share a common source with those of Adams.

1930s was largely government funded, and
research for the most <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> was independent of commercial interest. Schauberger

consequent demand that scientific research serves the needs of business and
commerce. In addition, the anonymous
'peer review' system is a <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of censorship against those who propose research
that does not conform to convention, or
which threatens the reviewer's own
agenda.
5. Living Energies, p. 9. His arch enemies,
the Viennese Association of Engineers,
had hatched a plot to dispose of him in a
mental hospital, under SS observation.
Schauberger was to go into the Vienna
University clinic for a routine examination of his WWI wounds. Before this, by
coincidence, he had tea with an <span class="t25 hoverable">old</span>
friend, Mrs Primavesi and told her he
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> return in twenty minutes. When he
did not, and she <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> he had not returned home either, she <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> to the
nearby clinic, <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whose</span> director she knew
well, refusing to leave until Viktor had
been found. He turned up in the portion
of the hospital reserved for the mentally
insane, trussed up in a straightjacket
waiting for the lethal injection (the standard practice for the disposal of undesirables in that regime). Needless to say, she
quickly extricated him. (Another theory
is that the plot against him was ordered
by Hitler himself, who had met
Schauberger.)

physicist Hugh Everett, who in 1957 observed that when a measurement is performed on a quantum system, all possible
outcomes of the measurement actually occur; this contrasts with the conventional
view that only <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> possible states

4. The ratio between created matter and the
energies required to create it was established in 1984 by the Nobel awarded

as about 1:1 thousand million, effectively

5. Entropy has its counterpart — ectropy

7. The Atmosphere and Electricity
1. High specific heat <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t14 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">means</span> that <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> is

heat retaining quality makes it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> for
heat storage systems.
2. The temperature <span class="t4 t18 t22 hoverable">neither</span> decreases nor increases constandy, but fluctuates as we ascend through the various atmospheric layers, so that at a <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> altitude, at around
7 miles (12km) for instance, the temperature is -76°F (-60°C), whereas around 31
miles (50km) it is 50°F (+10°C).
3. This increases by the inverse square of
the separation. If, for example, the separation is 10mm, then the potential is 12.
If the separation is reduced to 1/2, i.e.
5mm, then the potential is 22 (=4) and
so on, as shown in Fig. 12.6. The smaller
the separation, therefore, the greater the
corresponding potential, which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> be

is the amount a substance can assist or
resist the transfer of an electric charge.)

2. Over the Andes into the Pacific westerly, following the trade winds
3. Southwards, towards Patagonia
In the temperate latitudes, rainfall is derived from moisture-laden winds blowing in from the oceans. The tropical rainforests, on the other hand, particularly
the Amazonian, actually create rainfall
and recycle it. Only 25% of the Sun's energy heats the air. The remaining 75% is
converted into 'latent heat' by evapo-transpiration, the mechanism through which
<span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> is pumped into the atmosphere
from the leaves and stems of the plants.
The humid air rises rapidly, forming cumulo-nimbus and layered clouds that irrigate areas further downwind, releasing
the latent heat energy back into the atmosphere. Two-thirds of the world's rainfall is affected by these cloud systems
that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> produce most of the world's

3. Unpublished ms. The authors are NLP

Awareness — Awakening to the roots of
Learning and Perception was published
by Gateway in 1997. A few pioneers in education have attempted to redress this
overemphasis on absorbing discrete facts
that have no connection to the student,
by adopting a more holistic, inclusive, approach. The most successful of these have
probably been Maria Montessori
(Montessori schools for the younger
ages) and Rudolf Steiner (the Waldorf
Schools) for the <span class="t3 t5 t7 t9 t20 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> age range.
