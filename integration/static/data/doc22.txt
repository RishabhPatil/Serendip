various, and so <span class="t1 t2 t18 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">different</span> from each other, as to lead strongly to the inference that ignorance is

In the question now before us, the greater <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of mankind have united to acknowledge that

Gods. Protagoras doubted whether there were any. Diagoras the Melian and Theodorus of
Cyrene entirely believed there were no such beings. But they who have affirmed that there are

between them is so great, that it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be tiresome to enumerate their opinions; for they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span>

the contrary, whether all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> and constituted by them from the beginning; and

II. For there are some philosophers, both ancient and modern, who have conceived that the

There are other philosophers, and those, too, very <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> and illustrious men, who conceive the

here, but conceive likewise that the Deities consult and provide for the preservation of mankind.

invidious censurers, so as to induce the latter to repent of their unreasonable contradiction,
and the former to be glad to learn; for they who admonish <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> in a friendly <span class="t0 t1 t3 t5 t7 t8 t13 t16 t18 t20 t21 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> should be

But I observe that the several
books which I have lately published have occasioned <span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">much</span> noise and various discourse about
them; some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> wondering what the reason has been why I have applied myself so
suddenly to the study of philosophy, and <span class="t1 t7 t13 hoverable">others</span> desirous of knowing what my opinion is on
such subjects. I likewise perceive that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> wonder at my following that philosophy

<span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> neglected and forsaken. But it is a mistake to suppose that this application to
philosophical studies has been sudden on my part. I have applied myself to them from my
youth, at no small expense of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> and trouble; and I have been in the habit of philosophizing a

which are filled with quotations from philosophers, and to my intimacy with those very learned

carried on with the greatest care, accuracy, and precision; for coming to him at the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of the
Latin holidays, <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">according</span> to his own invitation and message from him, I <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> him sitting in his
study, and in a discourse with C. Velleius, the senator, who was then reputed by the
Epicureans the ablest of our countrymen. Q. Lucilius Balbus was likewise there, a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>
proficient in the doctrine of the Stoics, and esteemed equal to the most eminent of the Greeks
in that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of knowledge. As soon as Cotta saw me, You are come, <span class="t1 t7 t9 t14 t15 t17 t25 t28 hoverable">says</span> he, very seasonably;
for I am having a dispute with Velleius on an important subject, which, considering the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span>
of your studies, is not improper for you to join in.
VII. Indeed, <span class="t1 t7 t9 t14 t15 t17 t25 t28 hoverable">says</span> I, I think I am <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> very seasonably, as you say; for here are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> chiefs of

esteem <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> want an advocate. If Antiochus’s book, replies Cotta, which he lately sent to
Balbus, <span class="t1 t7 t9 t14 t15 t17 t25 t28 hoverable">says</span> true, you have no occasion to wish for your friend Piso; for Antiochus is of the
opinion that the Stoics do not differ from the Peripatetics in fact, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> they do in words; and I
should be glad to <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">know</span> what you think of that book, Balbus. I? <span class="t1 t7 t9 t14 t15 t17 t25 t28 hoverable">says</span> he. I wonder that
Antiochus, a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> of the clearest apprehension, should not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> what a vast difference there is
between the Stoics, who distinguish the honest and the profitable, not only in name, but
absolutely in kind, and the Peripatetics, who blend the honest with the profitable in such a
manner that they differ only in degrees and proportion, and not in kind. This is not a little
difference in words, but a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> in things; but of this hereafter. Now, if you think fit, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">let</span> us
return to what we began with.
With all my heart, <span class="t1 t7 t9 t14 t15 t17 t25 t28 hoverable">says</span> Cotta. But that this visitor (looking at me), who is just <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> in, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> not
be ignorant of what we are upon, I will inform him that we were discoursing on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of the
Gods; concerning which, as it is a subject that always appeared very obscure to me, I
prevailed on Velleius to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> us the sentiments of Epicurus. Therefore, continues he, if it is not
troublesome, Velleius, repeat what you have already stated to us. I will, <span class="t1 t7 t9 t14 t15 t17 t25 t28 hoverable">says</span> he, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> this
new-corner will be no advocate for me, but for you; for you have both, adds he, with a smile,
learned from the same Philo to be <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> of nothing. What we have learned from him, replied I,
Cotta will discover; but I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> not have you think I am <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> as an assistant to him, but as an

auditor, with an impartial and unbiassed mind, and not bound by any obligation to defend any
particular principle, whether I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> or dislike it.
VIII. After this, Velleius, with the confidence peculiar to his sect, dreading <span class="t15 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">nothing</span> so <span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">much</span> as
to seem to doubt of anything, began as if he had just then descended from the council of the
Gods, and Epicurus’s intervals of worlds. Do not attend, <span class="t1 t7 t9 t14 t15 t17 t25 t28 hoverable">says</span> he, to these idle and imaginary
tales; nor to the operator and builder of the World, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> of Plato’s Timaeus; nor to the <span class="t25 hoverable">old</span>
prophetic dame, the 'Pronoia' of the Stoics, which the Latins call Providence; nor to that round,
that burning, revolving deity, the World, endowed with sense and understanding; the prodigies
and wonders, not of inquisitive philosophers, but of dreamers!
For with what eyes of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> was your Plato able to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> that workhouse of such stupendous

what bars, what machines, what servants, were employed in so vast a work? How <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> the air,
fire, water, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> pay obedience and submit to the will of the architect? From whence
arose those five forms, of which the rest were composed, so aptly contributing to frame the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> and produce the senses? It is tedious to go through all, as they are of such a sort that
they look more <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> to be desired than to be discovered.
But, what is more remarkable, he gives us a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> which has been not only created, but, if I

Do you conceive him
to have the least skill in natural philosophy who is capable of thinking anything to be
everlasting that had a beginning? For what can possibly <span class="t29 hoverable">ever</span> have been <span class="t0 t2 t16 t18 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">put</span> <span class="t16 t21 hoverable">together</span> which

If your Providence, Lucilius, is the same as Plato’s God, I ask you, as before, who were the
assistants, what were the engines, what was the plan and preparation of the <span class="t3 t5 t7 t9 t20 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> work? If it
is not the same, then why did she <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> mortal, and not everlasting, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> Plato’s God?
IX. But I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> demand of you both, why these world-builders started up so suddenly, and lay

<span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t11 t20 t26 t27 hoverable">days</span> and nights in annual courses; for I acknowledge that those <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> not be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> the

I desire, therefore, to
know, Balbus, why this Providence of yours was idle for such an immense space of time? Did
she avoid labor?

XII. Empedocles, who erred in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> things, is most grossly mistaken in his notion of the Gods.
He lays down four natures as divine, from which he thinks that all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> were made. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> it is

Xenophon has committed almost the same mistakes, but in fewer words. In those sayings

can be an animated being I <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">cannot</span> conceive; but that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> is so we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> certainly maintain.
The same <span class="t9 hoverable">person</span> says, in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">another</span> place, that the sky is God; but can we possibly conceive
that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> is a being insensible, deaf to our prayers, our wishes, and our vows, and wholly
unconnected with us? In other books he thinks there is a <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> rational essence pervading all
nature, indued with <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> efficacy. He attributes the same <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> to the stars, to the years, to
the months, and to the seasons. In his interpretation of Hesiod’s Theogony, he entirely
destroys the established notions of the Gods; for he excludes Jupiter, Juno, and Vesta, and

those esteemed divine, from the number of them; but his doctrine is that these are names
which by some kind of allusion are <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> to mute and inanimate beings. The sentiments of his
disciple Aristo are not less erroneous. He <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> it impossible to conceive the <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of the
Deity, and asserts that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Gods</span> are destitute of sense; and he is entirely dubious whether the
Deity is an animated being or not.

In the books
he wrote against pleasure, in which he seems to be raving, he imagines the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Gods</span> to have a

more <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> than reason. So that this God, whom we <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">know</span> mentally and in the speculations of

XV. Persaeus, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">another</span> disciple of Zeno, <span class="t1 t7 t9 t14 t15 t17 t25 t28 hoverable">says</span> that they who have <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> discoveries

which are healthful and beneficial have derived their names from those of the Gods; so that he
thinks it not sufficient to call them the discoveries of Gods, but he urges that they themselves
should be deemed divine. What can be more absurd than to ascribe <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> honors to sordid

the Babylonian was a follower of the doctrine of Chrysippus; and in that <span class="t25 hoverable">book</span> which he wrote,
entitled “A Treatise concerning Minerva,” he separates the account of Jupiter’s bringing-forth,
and the birth of that virgin, from the fabulous, and reduces it to a natural construction.

Epicurus having freed us from these terrors and restored us to liberty, we have no dread of
those beings whom we have reason to think entirely free from all trouble themselves, and who
do not impose any on others. We pay our adoration, indeed, with piety and reverence to that
essence which is above all excellence and perfection. But I fear my zeal for this doctrine has

it is very safe in a discourse of this kind, and in this company. I, who am a priest, and who think
that religions and ceremonies ought sacredly to be maintained, am certainly desirous to have
the existence of the Gods, which is the principal point in debate, not only fixed in opinion, but
proved to a demonstration; for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> notions flow into and disturb the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> which sometimes

myself in particular; but I am still at liberty to find fault with the reasons you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> for it, which I

I allow that there are Gods. Instruct me, then, concerning their origin; inform me where they
are, what sort of body, what mind, they have, and what is their course of life; for these I am
desirous of knowing. You attribute the most absolute <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> and efficacy to atoms. Out of them
you pretend that everything is made. But there are no atoms, for there is <span class="t15 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">nothing</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> body;

ancient philosophers, delight in boys, defects are often pleasing. Alcaeus was charmed with a

Catulus, my friend and colleague’s father, was enamored with your fellow-citizen Roscius, on
whom he wrote these verses:

Roscius appearing on the left I spied:

The mortal’s beauty with th’ immortal vied.
Roscius more beautiful than a God! <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> he was then, as he now is, squint-eyed. But what
signifies that, if his defects were beauties to Catulus?
XXIX. I return to the Gods. Can we suppose any of them to be squint-eyed, or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> to have a

XXXI. In his statement of this sentence, some think that he avoided speaking clearly on

very little affected; but he <span class="t1 t7 t9 t14 t15 t17 t25 t28 hoverable">says</span> that the minds of all mortals are terrified by them. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Many</span>

the <span class="t1 t7 t13 hoverable">others</span> by the fear of the Gods.
But since you dare not (for I am now addressing my discourse to Epicurus himself) absolutely
deny the existence of the Gods, what hinders you from ascribing a <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> to the sun, the

Depending on these dreams, not only Epicurus, Metrodorus, and Hermachus declaimed
against Pythagoras, Plato, and Empedocles, but that little harlot Leontium presumed to write

you will say. Why, therefore, do you presume to assert that there are not only six hundred

XXXV. To return to the subject I was upon. What can be more childish than to assert that there
are no such creatures as are generated in the Red Sea or in India? The most curious inquirer

which you are so very fond of is <span class="t15 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">nothing</span> to the purpose. Is not a dog <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> a wolf? And, as
Ennius says,
The monkey, filthiest beast, how <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> to man!

sort of argument were once to prevail, Velleius, observe what it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> lead to. You have laid it
down as <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> that reason <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">cannot</span> possibly reside in any but the <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> form. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Another</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span>
affirm that it can exist in none but a terrestrial being; in none but a being that is born, that
grows up, and receives instruction, and that consists of a soul, and an infirm and perishable
body; in short, in none but a mortal man. But if you decline those opinions, why should a single
<span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> disturb you? You perceive that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> is possessed of reason and understanding, with all
the infirmities which I have mentioned interwoven with his being; abstracted from which, you

considerately, but at a venture; for surely you did not think what an encumbrance anything
superfluous or useless is, not only in a man, but a tree. How troublesome it is to have a finger
too much! And why so? Because <span class="t4 t18 t22 hoverable">neither</span> use nor ornament requires more than five; but your
Deity has not only a finger more than he wants, but a head, a neck, shoulders, sides, a paunch,
back, hams, hands, feet, thighs, and legs. Are these parts necessary to immortality? Are they
conducive to the existence of the Deity? Is the face itself of use? <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">One</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> rather <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">say</span> so of
the brain, the heart, the lights, and the liver; for these are the seats of life. The features of the

XXXVI. You censured those who, beholding those excellent and stupendous works, the world,
and its respective parts - the heaven, the earth, the seas - and the splendor with which they
are adorned; who, contemplating the sun, moon, and stars; and who, observing the maturity
and changes of the seasons, and vicissitudes of times, inferred from thence that there <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> be

from which you conclude that there are Gods? “I have,” <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">say</span> you, “a <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> information of a

But do you really imagine them to be such? How <span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">much</span> better are the notions of the ignorant

<span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> of a Deity doing nothing. The Egyptians (so <span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">much</span> ridiculed) held no beasts to be
sacred, except on account of some advantage which they had received from them. The ibis, a

very large bird, with strong legs and a horny <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> beak, destroys a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> number of serpents.
These birds keep Egypt from pestilential diseases by killing and devouring the flying serpents
<span class="t2 t4 t5 t22 t23 hoverable">brought</span> from the deserts of Lybia by the south-west wind, which prevents the mischief that

XXXVII. “They have <span class="t15 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">nothing</span> to do,” your teacher says. Epicurus truly, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> indolent boys, thinks

stations assigned to them: so that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> is the lowest; then <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> is next above the earth;

inhabit the earth, some the water, and some, of an amphibious nature, live in both. There are
some, also, which are <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> to be born in fire, and which often appear fluttering in burning
furnaces.
In the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> place, therefore, I ask you, Where is the habitation of your Deity? Secondly, What
motive is it that stirs him from his place, supposing he <span class="t29 hoverable">ever</span> moves? And, lastly, since it is
peculiar to animated beings to have an inclination to something that is agreeable to their
several natures, what is it that the Deity affects, and to what purpose does he exert the motion
of his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> and reason? In short, how is he happy? how eternal? Whichever of these points
you touch upon, I am afraid you will <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> lamely off.

reasoning which proceeds on a false foundation; for you asserted likewise that the <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of the
Deity is perceptible by the mind, but not by sense; that it is <span class="t4 t18 t22 hoverable">neither</span> solid, nor invariable in
number; that it is to be discerned by similitude and transition, and that a constant supply of
images is perpetually flowing on from innumerable atoms, on which our minds are intent; so
that we from that conclude that <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> to be happy and everlasting.

<span class="t6 t13 t14 t25 t27 hoverable">meaning</span> of all this? For if they exist only in thought, and have no solidity nor substance, what
difference can there be between thinking of a Hippocentaur and thinking of a Deity? Other
philosophers call <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> such conformation of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> a vain motion; but you term it “the
approach and entrance of images into the mind.” Thus, when I imagine that I <span class="t0 t5 t16 t22 hoverable">behold</span> T.
Gracchus haranguing the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> in the Capitol, and collecting their suffrages concerning M.
Octavius, I call that a vain motion of the mind: but you affirm that the images of Gracchus and
Octavius are present, which are only conveyed to my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> when they have arrived at the
Capitol. The case is the same, you say, in regard to the Deity, with the frequent representation
of which the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> is so affected that from thence it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be clearly understood that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Gods</span>

Let it be granted that there are images by which the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> is affected, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> it is only a <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span>

But what are
those images you talk of, or whence do they proceed? This loose manner of arguing is <span class="t19 hoverable">taken</span>
from Democritus; but he is reproved by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> for it; nor can you derive any conclusions
from it: the <span class="t3 t5 t7 t9 t20 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> system is weak and imperfect. For what can be more improbable than that
the images of Homer, Archilochus, Romulus, Numa, Pythagoras, and Plato should <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> into

ideas of men, countries, and cities which we <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> saw? How is it that the very <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> moment

of boasting of so much, it is easy to be free from that feeling when you have renounced all
belief in the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of the Gods; unless, indeed, you imagine that Diagoras or Theodorus, who
absolutely denied the being of the Gods, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> possibly be superstitious. I do not suppose that

philosophers are not only destructive of superstition, which arises from a vain fear of the Gods,

IV. For example: our augurs and the Etrurian haruspices saw the <span class="t3 t7 t9 t10 t15 t19 t22 hoverable">truth</span> of their art established
when P. Scipio and C. Figulus were consuls; for as Tiberius Gracchus, who was a <span class="t6 hoverable">second</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span>

perceiving that this accident had a religious influence on the people, he <span class="t2 t4 t5 t22 t23 hoverable">brought</span> the affair
before the senate. The senate <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> fit to refer it to those who usually <span class="t4 hoverable">took</span> cognizance of
such things. The haruspices were called, and declared that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> who had acted as Rogator
of the assembly had no <span class="t27 hoverable">right</span> to do so; to which, as I have heard my <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t28 hoverable">father</span> say, he replied with

Therefore, he then commanded them to withdraw; but not <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> afterward he wrote from his
province to the college of augurs, acknowledging that in reading the books he remembered
that he had illegally chosen a <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> for his tent in the gardens of Scipio, and had afterward

he had forgotten to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">take</span> the auspices; and that, therefore, the consuls had been created
informally. The augurs laid the case before the senate. The senate decreed that they should
resign their charge, and so they accordingly abdicated. What greater example need we seek
for? The wisest, perhaps the most excellent of men, chose to confess his fault, which he <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t18 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">might</span>
have concealed, rather than leave the public the least atom of religious guilt; and the consuls
chose to quit the <span class="t6 t9 t22 t29 hoverable">highest</span> office in the State, rather than fill it for a moment in defiance of
religion. How <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> is the reputation of the augurs!

His fourth cause, and that the strongest, is drawn from the regularity of the motion and

VIII. “That which reasons is superior to that which does not; <span class="t15 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">nothing</span> is superior to the world;
the world, therefore, reasons.” By the same rule the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be proved to be wise, happy,
and eternal; for the possession of all these qualities is superior to the want of them; and
<span class="t15 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">nothing</span> is superior to the world; the inevitable consequence of which argument is, that the
world, therefore, is a Deity. He goes on: “No <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of anything void of sense is capable of

proceeds, and pursues the argument closely. “Nothing,” <span class="t1 t7 t9 t14 t15 t17 t25 t28 hoverable">says</span> he, “that is destitute itself of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span>
and reason can generate a being possessed of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> and reason; but the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> does generate

reason.”
He concludes his argument in his usual manner with a simile: “If well-tuned pipes should spring
out of the olive, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> you have the slightest doubt that there was in the olive-tree itself some
kind of skill and knowledge? Or if the plane-tree <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> produce harmonious lutes, surely you

would infer, on the same principle, that music was contained in the plane-tree. Why, then,
should we not believe the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> is a living and wise being, since it produces living and wise
beings out of itself?”
IX. But as I have been insensibly led into a length of discourse beyond my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> design (for I

For everything which
is of a warm and fiery character is agitated and stirred up by its own motion. But that which is
nourished and grows is influenced by a <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> regular and equable motion. And as <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> as
this motion remains in us, so <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> does sense and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> remain; but the moment that it abates
and is extinguished, we ourselves decay and perish.
By arguments <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> these, Cleanthes shows how <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> is the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of heat in all bodies.

observes that there is no food so gross as not to be digested in a night and a day; and that

The heat <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> is more pure, clear, and lively, and, consequently, better adapted to

It is absurd, therefore, to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">say</span> that the world, which is endued with a perfect, free, pure,

On such reasoning is founded this opinion, that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> is possessed of understanding,
because it certainly has more perfections in itself than any other nature; for as there is no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span>
of our bodies so considerable as the <span class="t3 t5 t7 t9 t20 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> of us, so it is clear that there is no particular portion
of the universe equal in magnitude to the <span class="t3 t5 t7 t9 t20 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> of it; from whence it follows that wisdom <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span>
be an attribute of the world; otherwise man, who is a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of it, and possessed of reason, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span>
be superior to the entire world.

And thus, if we proceed from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> rude, unfinished natures to the most superior and perfect

For, in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> place, we
observe that those vegetables which are produced out of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> are supported by nature,
and she gives them no further supply than is sufficient to preserve them by nourishing them
and making them grow. To beasts she has <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> sense and motion, and a faculty which directs
them to what is wholesome, and prompts them to shun what is noxious to them. On <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> she
has conferred a greater portion of her favor; inasmuch as she has added reason, by which he
is enabled to command his passions, to moderate some, and to subdue others.
XIII. In the fourth and <span class="t6 t9 t22 t29 hoverable">highest</span> degree are those beings which are naturally wise and good, who

world, in which it is inevitable that that perfect and complete reason should be inherent. Nor is
it possible that it should be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> with justice that there is any arrangement of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> in which

<span class="t15 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">nothing</span> can hinder universal nature, because she is herself the ruler and governor of all other

maturity and perfection, is superior to that which is not — as, a horse to a colt, a dog to a

enlightens the <span class="t3 t5 t7 t9 t20 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> universe, covering such a vast extent of space, and its <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> is such that

And this fire, which the convenience of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> requires, is the devourer and consumer of
everything, and throws into confusion and destroys whatever it reaches. On the contrary, the
corporeal heat is full of life, and salutary; and vivifies, preserves, cherishes, increases, and

As, then, some animals are generated in the earth, some in the water, and some in the air,
Aristotle thinks it ridiculous to imagine that no animal is formed in that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of the universe
which is the most capable to produce them. But the stars are situated in the ethereal space;
and as this is an element the most subtle, <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whose</span> motion is continual, and <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whose</span> force does
not decay, it follows, of necessity, that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> animated being which is produced in it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> be
endowed with the quickest sense and the swiftest motion. The stars, therefore, being there
generated, it is a natural inference to suppose them endued with such a degree of sense and
understanding as places them in the rank of Gods.
XVI. For it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be observed that they who inhabit countries of a pure, clear air have a quicker
apprehension and a readier genius than those who live in a thick, foggy climate. It is <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span>
likewise that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of a man’s diet has an effect on the mind; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> it is probable that
the stars are possessed of an excellent understanding, inasmuch as they are situated in the
ethereal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of the universe, and are nourished by the vapors of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> and sea, which are
purified by their <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> passage to the heavens. But the invariable <span class="t0 t6 t7 t8 t11 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">order</span> and regular motion of
the stars plainly manifest their sense and understanding; for all motion which seems to be
conducted with reason and harmony supposes an intelligent principle, that does not act blindly,
or inconsistently, or at random. And this regularity and consistent course of the stars from all
eternity indicates not any natural order, for it is pregnant with sound reason, not fortune (for
fortune, being a friend to change, despises consistency). It follows, therefore, that they move
spontaneously by their own sense and divinity.

Aristotle <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> deserves high commendation for his observation that everything that moves is
either <span class="t0 t2 t16 t18 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">put</span> in motion by natural impulse, or by some external force, or of its own accord; and
that the sun, and moon, and all the stars move; but that those <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> which are moved by
natural impulse are either borne downward by their weight, or upward by their lightness;
<span class="t4 t18 t22 hoverable">neither</span> of which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> be the case with the stars, because they move in a regular circle
and orbit. Nor can it be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> that there is some superior force which causes the stars to be
moved in a manner contrary to nature. For what superior force can there be? It follows,
therefore, that their motion <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> be voluntary. And whoever is convinced of this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> discover

is the difference <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> whether a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> denies their existence, or deprives them of all design
and action; for whatever is wholly inactive seems to me not to exist at all. Their existence,
therefore, appears so plain that I can scarcely think that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> in his senses who denies it.
XVII. It now remains that we consider what is the character of the Gods. <span class="t15 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">Nothing</span> is more
difficult than to divert our thoughts and judgment from the information of our corporeal sight,
and the view of objects which our eyes are accustomed to; and it is this difficulty which has
had such an influence on the unlearned, and on philosophers <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> who resembled the

the Deity comprehends <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> — <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> of all, that he is an animated being; secondly, that

approaches and retreats, and have all the rest of their motions, in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> regular constant and

sometimes they appear, and sometimes they disappear; sometimes they advance towards the
sun, and sometimes they retreat; sometimes they precede him, and sometimes follow him;
sometimes they move faster, sometimes slower, and sometimes they do not stir in the least,
but for a while stand still. From these unequal motions of the planets, mathematicians have
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> that the “great year “ in which the sun, moon, and five wandering stars, having finished
their revolutions, are <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> in their original situation. In how <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> this is effected is <span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">much</span>
disputed, but it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> be a <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> and definite period. For the planet Saturn (called by the
Greeks 'Phainon'), which is farthest from the earth, finishes his course in about thirty years;
and in his course there is something very singular, for sometimes he moves before the sun,
sometimes he keeps behind it; at <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> lying hidden in the night, at <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">another</span> again

planet, and nearer the earth, is Jupiter, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> 'Phaethon', which passes the same orbit of the
twelve signs in twelve years, and goes through exactly the same variety in its course that the
star of Saturn does. Next to Jupiter is the planet Mars (in Greek, 'Puroeis'), which finishes its
revolution through the same orbit as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> previously mentioned, in twenty-four months,
wanting six days, as I imagine. Below this is Mercury (called by the Greeks 'Stilbon'), which
performs the same course in little less than a year, and is <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> farther distant from the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t14 t23 t25 t28 hoverable">sun</span>

than the space of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> sign, whether it precedes or follows it. The lowest of the five planets,
and nearest the earth, is that of Venus (called in Greek 'Phosphoros'). Before the rising of the
sun, it is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the morning-star, and after the setting, the evening-star. It has the same
revolution through the zodiac, both as to latitude and longitude, with the other planets, in a
year, and <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> is more than <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> signs from the sun, whether it precedes or follows it.
XXI. I cannot, therefore, conceive that this constant course of the planets, this just agreement
in such various motions through all eternity, can be preserved <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> a mind, reason, and

reason and prudence. Their motion is daily, regular, and constant. They do not move with the
sky, nor have they an adhesion to the firmament, as they who are ignorant of natural
philosophy affirm. For the sky, which is thin, transparent, and suffused with an equal heat,
does not seem by its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> to have <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> to whirl about the stars, or to be proper to contain

seasons; the Greek <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> for which Deity implies as much, for he is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> 'Kronos,' which is
the same with 'Chronos,' that is, a “space of time.” But he is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Saturn, because he is filled
(saturatur) with years; and he is usually feigned to have devoured his children, because time,
<span class="t29 hoverable">ever</span> insatiable, consumes the rolling years; but to restrain him from immoderate haste, Jupiter
has confined him to the course of the stars, which are as chains to him. Jupiter (that is, juvans
pater) signifies a “helping father,” whom, by changing the cases, we call Jove, a juvando. The
poets call him “father of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Gods</span> and men;” and our ancestors “the most good, the most great;”

(that is, beneficent) than to be great, the title of “most good” precedes that of “most great.” This,
then, is he whom Ennius <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t14 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">means</span> in the following passage, before quoted—

XXIX. I am now to show that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> is governed by the providence of the Gods. This is an
important point, which you Academics endeavor to confound; and, indeed, the <span class="t3 t5 t7 t9 t20 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> contest is
with you, Cotta; for your sect, Velleius, <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">know</span> very little of what is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> on <span class="t1 t2 t18 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">different</span> subjects by

'Pronoia,' Providence, invented by the Stoics, you were led into that error by imagining that
Providence was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> by them to be a particular Deity that governs the <span class="t3 t5 t7 t9 t20 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> universe,
whereas it is only spoken in a short manner; as when it is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> “The commonwealth of Athens
is governed by the council,” it is meant “of the Areopagus;” so when we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">say</span> “The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> is
governed by providence,” we mean “by the providence of the Gods.” To express ourselves,
therefore, more fully and clearly, we say, “The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> is governed by the providence of the
Gods.” Be not, therefore, lavish of your railleries, of which your sect has little to spare: if I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span>
advise you, do not attempt it. It does not <span class="t8 t13 hoverable">become</span> you, it is not your talent, nor is it in your
power. This is not applied to you in particular who have the education and politeness of a
Roman, but to all your sect in general, and especially to your leader — a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> unpolished,
illiterate, insulting, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> wit, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> reputation, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> elegance.
XXX. I assert, then, that the universe, with all its parts, was originally constituted, and has,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> any cessation, been <span class="t29 hoverable">ever</span> governed by the providence of the Gods. This argument we
Stoics commonly divide into <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> parts; the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> of which is, that the existence of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Gods</span>
being once known, it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> follow that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> is governed by their wisdom; the second, that
as everything is under the direction of an intelligent nature, which has produced that beautiful
<span class="t0 t6 t7 t8 t11 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">order</span> in the world, it is evident that it is formed from animating principles; the third is deduced
from those glorious <span class="t9 t16 t26 hoverable">works</span> which we <span class="t0 t5 t16 t22 hoverable">behold</span> in the heavens and the earth.
First, then, we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> either deny the existence of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Gods</span> (as Democritus and Epicurus by
their doctrine of images in some sort do), or, if we acknowledge that there are Gods, we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span>
believe they are employed, and that, too, in something excellent. Now, <span class="t15 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">nothing</span> is so excellent
as the administration of the universe. The universe, therefore, is governed by the wisdom of
the Gods. Otherwise, we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> imagine that there is some <span class="t1 t3 t9 t15 t20 t21 t26 t29 hoverable">cause</span> superior to the Deity, whether
it be a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> inanimate, or a necessity agitated by a mighty force, that produces those
beautiful <span class="t9 t16 t26 hoverable">works</span> which we behold. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Gods</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> then be <span class="t4 t18 t22 hoverable">neither</span> supreme nor
excellent, if you subject it to that necessity or to that nature, by which you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> the
heaven, the earth, and the seas to be governed. But there is <span class="t15 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">nothing</span> superior to the Deity; the
world, therefore, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> be governed by him: consequently, the Deity is under no obedience or
subjection to nature, but does himself rule over all nature. In effect, if we allow the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Gods</span> have
understanding, we allow <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> their providence, which regards the most important things; for,
can they be ignorant of those important things, and how they are to be conducted and
preserved, or do they want <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> to sustain and direct them? Ignorance is inconsistent with
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of the Gods, and imbecility is repugnant to their majesty. From whence it follows, as
we assert, that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> is governed by the providence of the Gods.
XXXI. But supposing, which is incontestable, that there are Gods, they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> be animated, and

It turns the whirlpools up, its force so strong,

Runs furious on, and throws about the waves.

What and how various are the kinds of animals, tame or wild? The flights and notes of birds?
How do the beasts live in the fields and in the forests?

But how beautiful is the sea! How pleasant to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> the extent of it! What a multitude and variety

moon, which, as mathematicians demonstrate, is bigger than half the earth, makes her
revolutions through the same spaces as the sun; but at <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> approaching, and at <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">another</span>

When she is <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span>
under the sun, and opposite to it, the brightness of her rays is lost; but when the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> directly

their motions are sometimes quick, sometimes slow, and often they stand still. There is <span class="t15 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">nothing</span>
more wonderful, <span class="t15 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">nothing</span> more beautiful. There is a vast number of fixed stars, distinguished by

Cynosura moves about the same pole, with a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> number of stars, and ranged in the same
order:
This the Phoenicians choose to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> their guide
When on the ocean in the night they ride.
Adorned with stars of more refulgent light,
The other shines, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> appears at night.
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Though</span> this is small, sailors its use have found;
More inward is its course, and short its round.
XLII. The aspect of those stars is the more admirable, because,
The Dragon grim between them bends his way,
As through the winding banks the currents stray,
And up and down in sinuous bending rolls.
His <span class="t3 t5 t7 t9 t20 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> is excellent; but the shape of his head and the ardor of his eyes are most
remarkable.
Various the stars which deck his glittering head;
His temples are with double glory spread;
From his fierce eyes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> fervid lights afar
Flash, and his chin shines with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> radiant star;
Bow’d is his head; and his round neck he bends,
And to the tail of Helice extends.
The rest of the Dragon’s <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> at <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> hour in the night.
Here suddenly the head a little hides
Itself, where all its parts, which are in sight,
And those unseen in the same <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> unite.

Near to this head
Is placed the figure of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> that moves
Weary and sad,
which the Greeks
Engonasis do call, because he’s borne
About with bended knee. Near him is placed
The crown with a refulgent lustre graced.
This indeed is at his back; but Anguitenens (the Snake-holder) is near his head:
The Greeks him Ophiuchus call, renown’d
The name. He strongly grasps the serpent round
With both his hands; himself the serpent folds
Beneath his breast, and round his middle holds;
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> gravely he, bright shining in the skies,
Moves on, and treads on Nepa’s breast and eyes.
The Septentriones are followed by—
Arctophylax, that’s <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to be the same
Which we Boötes call, who has the name,
Because he drives the Greater Bear along
Yoked to a wain.
Besides, in Boötes,
A star of glittering rays about his waist,
Arcturus called, a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> renown’d, is placed.
Beneath which is
The Virgin of illustrious form, <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whose</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t29 hoverable">hand</span>
Holds a bright spike.
XLIII. And truly these signs are so regularly disposed that a <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> wisdom evidently appears in
them:
Beneath the Bear’s head have the Twins their seat,
Under his chest the Crab, beneath his feet
The mighty Lion darts a trembling flame.
The Charioteer
On the left side of Gemini we see,
And at his head <span class="t0 t5 t16 t22 hoverable">behold</span> fierce Helice;
On his left shoulder the bright Goat appears.

But to proceed—
This is indeed a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> and glorious star,
On th’ other side the Kids, inferior far,
Yield but a slender <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> to mortal eyes.
Under his feet
The horned bull, with sturdy limbs, is placed:
his head is spangled with a number of stars;
These by the Greeks are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the Hyades,
from raining; for 'huein' is to rain: <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> they are injudiciously <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Suculae by our people,
as if they had their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> from 'hus', a sow, and not from 'huo'.
Behind the Lesser Bear, Cepheus follows with extended hands,
For close behind the Lesser Bear he comes.
Before him goes
Cassiopea with a faintish light;
But near her moves (fair and illustrious sight!)
Andromeda, who, with an eager pace,
Seems to avoid her parent’s mournful face.
With glittering mane the Horse now seems to tread,
So near he comes, on her refulgent head;
With a fair star, that close to him appears,
A double <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> and but <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> he wears;
By which he seems ambitious in the sky
An everlasting knot of stars to tie.
Near him the Ram, with wreathed horns, is placed;
by whom The Fishes are; of which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> seems to haste
Somewhat before the other, to the blast
Of the north wind exposed.
XLIV. Perseus is described as placed at the feet of Andromeda:
And him the sharp blasts of the north wind beat.
Near his left knee, but dim their light, their seat
The small Pleiades maintain. We find,
Not <span class="t6 t9 t18 t26 hoverable">far</span> from them, the Lyre but slightly join’d.
Next is the winged Bird, that seems to fly
Beneath the spacious covering of the sky.

Near the head of the Horse lies the <span class="t27 hoverable">right</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t29 hoverable">hand</span> of Aquarius, then all Aquarius himself.
Then Capricorn, with half the <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of beast,
Breathes chill and piercing colds from his strong breast,
And in a spacious circle takes his round;
When him, while in the winter solstice bound,
The <span class="t0 t8 t11 t14 t23 t25 t28 hoverable">sun</span> has visited with constant light,
He turns his course, and shorter makes the night.
Not <span class="t6 t9 t18 t26 hoverable">far</span> from hence is seen
The Scorpion rising lofty from below;
By him the Archer, with his bended bow;
Near him the Bird, with gaudy feathers spread;
And the fierce Eagle hovers o’er his head.
Next comes the Dolphin;
Then bright Orion, who obliquely moves;
he is followed by
The fervent Dog, bright with refulgent stars:
next the Hare follows
Unwearied in his course. At the Dog’s tail
Argo moves on, and moving seems to sail;
O’er her the Ram and Fishes have their place;
The illustrious vessel touches, in her pace,
The river’s banks;
which you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> winding and extending itself to a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> length.
The Fetters at the Fishes’ tails are hung.
By Nepa’s head <span class="t0 t5 t16 t22 hoverable">behold</span> the Altar stand,
Which by the breath of southern winds is fann’d;
near which the Centaur
Hastens his mingled parts to join beneath
The Serpent, there extending his <span class="t27 hoverable">right</span> hand,
To where you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> the monstrous Scorpion stand,
Which he at the bright Altar fiercely slays.
Here on her lower parts <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> Hydra raise
Herself;
<span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whose</span> bulk is very <span class="t6 t9 t18 t26 hoverable">far</span> extended.
Amid the winding of her body’s placed

The shining Goblet; and the glossy Crow
Plunges his beak into her parts below.
Antecanis beneath the Twins is seen,
Call’d Procyon by the Greeks.
Can any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> in his senses imagine that this disposition of the stars, and this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t15 t18 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heaven</span> so
beautifully adorned, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> <span class="t29 hoverable">ever</span> have been formed by a fortuitous concourse of atoms? Or what
other nature, being destitute of intellect and reason, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> possibly have produced these
effects, which not only required reason to <span class="t22 hoverable">bring</span> them about, but the very character of which
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> not be understood and appreciated <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> the most strenuous exertions of well-directed
reason?
XLV. But our admiration is not limited to the objects here described. What is most wonderful is
that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> is so durable, and so perfectly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> for lasting that it is not to be impaired by
time; for all its parts tend equally to the center, and are bound <span class="t16 t21 hoverable">together</span> by a sort of chain,
which surrounds the elements. This chain is nature, which being diffused through the universe,
and performing all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> with judgment and reason, attracts the extremities to the center.
If, then, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> is round, and if on that account all its parts, being of equal dimensions and
relative proportions, mutually support and are supported by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> another, it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> follow that as
all the parts incline to the center (for that is the lowest <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> of a globe) there is <span class="t15 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">nothing</span>
whatever which can <span class="t0 t2 t16 t18 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">put</span> a stop to that propensity in the case of such <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> weights. For the
same reason, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> the sea is higher than the earth, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> because it has the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> tendency, it is
collected everywhere, equally concentres, and <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> overflows, and is <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> wasted.
The air, which is contiguous, ascends by its lightness, but diffuses itself through the whole;
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> it is by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> joined and united to the sea, and at the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> borne by the same

proper to supply <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> and wholesome air for the support of animated beings. This is
encompassed by the <span class="t6 t9 t22 t29 hoverable">highest</span> region of the heavens, which is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the sky, which is joined to
the extremity of the air, but retains its own heat pure and unmixed.
XLVI. The stars have their revolutions in the sky, and are continued by the tendency of all parts
towards the center. Their duration is perpetuated by their <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> and figure, for they are round;
which form, as I think has been before observed, is the least liable to injury; and as they are
composed of fire, they are fed by the vapors which are exhaled by the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t14 t23 t25 t28 hoverable">sun</span> from the earth, the
sea, and other waters; but when these vapors have nourished and refreshed the stars, and the
<span class="t3 t5 t7 t9 t20 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> sky, they are sent back to be exhaled again; so that very little is lost or consumed by the
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> of the stars and the flame of the sky.

from the sultry heat of the sun. When their young begin to be able to use their wings, they
attend and instruct them; and then their cares are at an end.

to eat, to drink, and to breathe. For these operations the mouth is most aptly framed, which, by
the assistance of the nostrils, draws in the more air.
LIV. The teeth are there placed to divide and grind the food. The fore-teeth, being sharp and
opposite to each other, cut it asunder, and the hind-teeth (called the grinders) chew it, in which
office the tongue seems to assist. At the root of the tongue is the gullet, which receives
whatever is swallowed: it touches the tonsils on each side, and terminates at the interior
extremity of the palate. When, by the motions of the tongue, the food is forced into this
passage, it descends, and those parts of the gullet which are below it are dilated, and those
above are contracted. There is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">another</span> passage, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> by physicians the rough artery, which
reaches to the lungs, for the entrance and return of the air we breathe; and as its orifice is

furnished with a sort of coverlid, lest, by the accidental falling of any food into it, the respiration
should be stopped.
As the stomach, which is beneath the gullet, receives the meat and drink, so the lungs and the
<span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t16 t19 t22 t23 t25 t26 hoverable">heart</span> draw in the air from without. The stomach is wonderfully composed, consisting almost
wholly of nerves; it abounds with membranes and fibres, and detains what it receives, whether
solid or liquid, till it is altered and digested. It sometimes contracts, sometimes dilates. It blends
and mixes the food together, so that it is easily concocted and digested by its force of heat,
and by the animal spirits is distributed into the other parts of the body.
LV. As to the lungs, they are of a soft and spongy substance, which renders them the most
commodious for respiration; they alternately dilate and contract to receive and return the air,
that what is the chief animal sustenance <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be always fresh. The juice, by which we are
nourished, being separated from the rest of the food, passes the stomach and intestines to the
liver, through open and direct passages, which lead from the mesentery to the gates of the
liver (for so they call those vessels at the entrance of it). There are other passages from thence,
through which the food has its course when it has passed the liver. When the bile, and those
humors which proceed from the kidneys, are separated from the food, the remaining <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> turns

adjoin.

The judgment of the ears is not less admirably and scientifically contrived with regard to vocal

You have no idea, O Cotta, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> Velleius, how impatient I am to hear what you have to say.
For since our friend Balbus was highly delighted with your discourse against Epicurus, I ought
in my turn to be solicitous to hear what you can <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">say</span> against the Stoics; and I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> will <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span>

I wish, by Hercules! I were, replies Cotta; for it is more difficult to dispute with Lucilius than it
was with you. Why so? <span class="t1 t7 t9 t14 t15 t17 t25 t28 hoverable">says</span> Velleius. Because, replies Cotta, your Epicurus, in my opinion,
does not contend strongly for the Gods: he only, for the sake of avoiding any unpopularity or
punishment, is afraid to deny their existence; for when he asserts that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Gods</span> are wholly

them, he seems to jest with us, and to think it sufficient if he allows that there are beings of any

But with regard to Balbus, I suppose you observed how <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span>

Balbus, I will <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> you the choice, either to answer me <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> particular as I go on, or permit me

II. Very well, <span class="t1 t7 t9 t14 t15 t17 t25 t28 hoverable">says</span> Cotta; then <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">let</span> us proceed as our conversation <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> direct. But before I enter
on the subject, I have a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">word</span> to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">say</span> concerning myself; for I am greatly influenced by your
authority, and your exhortation at the conclusion of your discourse, when you desired me to
remember that I was Cotta and Pontifex; by which I presume you intimated that I should
defend the sacred rites and religion and ceremonies which we received from our ancestors.
Most undoubtedly I always have, and always <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> defend them, nor <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> the arguments either

of the learned or unlearned <span class="t29 hoverable">ever</span> remove the opinions which I have imbibed from them
concerning the worship of the immortal Gods. In matters of religion I submit to the rules of the
high-priests, T. Coruncanius, P. Scipio, and P. Scaevola; not to the sentiments of Zeno,
Cleanthes, or Chrysippus; and I pay a greater regard to what C. Laelius, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of our augurs and
wise men, has <span class="t23 hoverable">written</span> concerning religion, in that noble oration of his, than to the most eminent
of the Stoics: and as the <span class="t3 t5 t7 t9 t20 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> religion of the Romans at <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> consisted in sacrifices and
divination by birds, to which have since been added predictions, if the interpreters of the
Sibylline oracle or the aruspices have foretold any event from portents and prodigies, I have
<span class="t29 hoverable">ever</span> <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> that there was no point of all these <span class="t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t12 t15 t19 t20 t23 t25 hoverable">holy</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> which deserved to be despised. I
have been <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> persuaded that Romulus, by instituting divination, and Numa, by establishing
sacrifices, laid the foundation of Rome, which undoubtedly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> have risen to such a

These, Balbus,
are my sentiments both as a priest and as Cotta. But you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> <span class="t22 hoverable">bring</span> me to your opinion by the
force of your reason: for I have a <span class="t27 hoverable">right</span> to demand from you, as a philosopher, a reason for the
religion which you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have me embrace. But I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> believe the religion of our ancestors

III. What proof, <span class="t1 t7 t9 t14 t15 t17 t25 t28 hoverable">says</span> Balbus, do you require of me? You have proposed, <span class="t1 t7 t9 t14 t15 t17 t25 t28 hoverable">says</span> Cotta, four
articles. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">First</span> of all, you undertook to prove that there “are Gods;” secondly, “of what kind and
character they are;” thirdly, that “the universe is governed by them;” lastly, that “they provide
for the welfare of mankind in particular.” Thus, if I remember rightly, you divided your discourse.
Exactly so, replies Balbus; but <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">let</span> us <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> what you require.

Why do you expect a proof from me, <span class="t1 t7 t9 t14 t15 t17 t25 t28 hoverable">says</span> Balbus, if you thoroughly believe it? Because, <span class="t1 t7 t9 t14 t15 t17 t25 t28 hoverable">says</span>
Cotta, I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> to this discussion as if I had <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> of the Gods, or heard anything
concerning them. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Take</span> me as a disciple wholly ignorant and unbiassed, and prove to me all

was no need of any proof? In that, answers Balbus, I have followed your example, whom I
have often observed, when pleading in the Forum, to load the judge with all the arguments
which the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of your <span class="t1 t3 t9 t15 t20 t21 t26 t29 hoverable">cause</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> permit.

have a <span class="t27 hoverable">right</span> to follow it.

serves to confound the clearest matters; besides, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> I <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t18 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">might</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">take</span> this method in pleading,

And with regard to your making use of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> eye only when you look on me, there is no reason
for it, since <span class="t16 t21 hoverable">together</span> they have the same view; and since nature, to which you attribute wisdom,
has been pleased to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> us <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> passages by which we receive light. But the <span class="t3 t7 t9 t10 t15 t19 t22 hoverable">truth</span> is, that it
was because you did not think that the existence of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Gods</span> was so evident as you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span>

It was sufficient for me to believe it on the
tradition of our ancestors; and since you disregard authorities, and appeal to reason, permit my
reason to defend them against yours. The proofs on which you <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> the existence of the

Gods tend only to render a proposition doubtful that, in my opinion, is not so; I have not only
retained in my memory the <span class="t3 t5 t7 t9 t20 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> of these proofs, but <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> the <span class="t0 t6 t7 t8 t11 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">order</span> in which you proposed

conceive that there is some divinity that governs those celestial bodies; on which you quoted

V. But the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Gods</span> have appeared to us, as to Posthumius at the Lake Regillus, and to Vatienus

men, and who were buried in Lacedaemon, as we learn from Homer, who lived in the next age
- do you believe, I say, that they appeared to Vatienus on the road mounted on white horses,

Should you not believe, what is probable, that the souls of eminent men, such as the
Tyndaridae, are <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> and immortal, rather than that those bodies which had been reduced to
ashes should mount on horses, and fight in an army? If you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">say</span> that was possible, you ought
to show how it is so, and not amuse us with fabulous <span class="t25 hoverable">old</span> women’s stories.
Do you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">take</span> these for fabulous stories? <span class="t1 t7 t9 t14 t15 t17 t25 t28 hoverable">says</span> Balbus. Is not the temple, built by Posthumius in
honor of Castor and Pollux, to be seen in the Forum? Is not the decree of the senate
concerning Vatienus still subsisting? As to the affair of Sagra, it is a common proverb <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span>
the Greeks; when they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> affirm anything strongly, they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">say</span> “It is as <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> as what passed

but I ask reasons of you. [...]
VI. We are now to speak of predictions. No <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> can avoid what is to come, and, indeed, it is
commonly useless to <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">know</span> it; for it is a miserable case to be afflicted to no purpose, and not to
have <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> the last, the common comfort, hope, which, <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">according</span> to your principles, none can

But whence comes that divination? To whom is owing that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> from the entrails of

diviners are often wrong in their conjectures. But physicians, you say, are likewise often

mistaken. What comparison can there be between divination, of the origin of which we are
ignorant, and physic, which proceeds on principles intelligible to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> one? You believe that
the Decii, in devoting themselves to death, appeased the Gods. How great, then, was the
iniquity of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Gods</span> that they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> not be appeased but at the price of such noble blood! That
was the stratagem of generals such as the Greeks call 'strategema', and it was a stratagem
worthy such illustrious leaders, who consulted the public <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> at the expense of their

If you assure me that you have, I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> believe you, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> I really <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">know</span> not what a Faun is.
VII. I do not, then, O Balbus, from anything that you have said, perceive as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> that it is proved

Very well, <span class="t1 t7 t9 t14 t15 t17 t25 t28 hoverable">says</span> Cotta. Since, then, you have divided the <span class="t3 t5 t7 t9 t20 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> question into four parts, and I

the prepossessions of the eyes; but that as <span class="t15 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">nothing</span> is more excellent than the Deity, you did
not doubt that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> was God, because there is <span class="t15 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">nothing</span> better in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> than the world, and

Now, in what sense do you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">say</span> there is <span class="t15 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">nothing</span> better than the world? If you mean that there is
<span class="t15 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">nothing</span> more beautiful, I agree with you; that there is <span class="t15 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">nothing</span> more adapted to our wants, I
likewise agree with you: but if you mean that <span class="t15 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">nothing</span> is wiser than the world, I am by no <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t14 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">means</span>

comprehend your opinion.
IX. <span class="t15 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">Nothing</span> is better than the world, you say. Nor is there, indeed, anything on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> better than
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t22 t23 hoverable">city</span> of Rome; do you think, therefore, that our <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t22 t23 hoverable">city</span> has a mind; that it thinks and reasons; or
that this most beautiful city, being void of sense, is not preferable to an ant, because an ant
has sense, understanding, reason, and memory? You should consider, Balbus, what ought to
be allowed you, and not advance <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> because they please you.

X. What can be more regular than the flux and reflux of the Euripus at Chalcis, the Sicilian sea,
and the violence of the ocean in those parts
where the rapid tide
Does Europe from the Libyan coast divide?
The same appears on the Spanish and British coasts. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">Must</span> we conclude that some Deity

These arguments are founded on the same erroneous principles as Zeno’s, for he does not
define what is meant by being better or more excellent, or distinguish between an intelligent
<span class="t1 t3 t9 t15 t20 t21 t26 t29 hoverable">cause</span> and a natural cause. Chrysippus adds, “If there are no Gods, there is <span class="t15 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">nothing</span> better than

XI. Socrates, in Xenophon, asks, “Whence had <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> his understanding, if there was none in

conversing with the moon when she approaches near it, or that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> forms an harmonious

For I readily agree to what you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> about the harmony and general agreement of nature,

parts of the universe; and the greater that is in its own power, the less is it necessary to have
recourse to a <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> intelligence.

XIV. The substance of an animal is either simple or compound; simple, if it is composed only of
earth, of fire, of air, or of <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> (and of such a sort of being we can <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> no idea); compound, if
it is formed of <span class="t1 t2 t18 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">different</span> elements, which have each their proper situation, and have a natural
tendency to it -- this element tending towards the <span class="t6 t9 t22 t29 hoverable">highest</span> parts, that towards the lowest, and

However, when I consider what is advanced by the Stoics, my contempt for the ignorant
multitude vanishes. For these are their divinities. The Syrians worshipped a fish. The
Egyptians consecrated beasts of almost <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> kind.

such, how can the <span class="t1 t7 t13 hoverable">others</span> be Deities? You, Balbus, seemed to agree with me that the honors
which they received were not from their being regarded as immortals, but as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> richly

But if you think Latona a Goddess, how can you avoid admitting Hecate to be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> also, who
was the daughter of Asteria, Latona’s sister? Certainly she is one, if we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> judge by the

the Eumenides? for they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> have a temple at Athens, and, if I understand right, the Romans

practise virtue, and to expose themselves the more willingly to dangers in their country’s cause.
From this motive the Athenians have deified Erechtheus and his daughters, and have erected

As you deify the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> under the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> of Ceres, because, as you said, she bears fruits (a

All these opinions arise from <span class="t25 hoverable">old</span> stories that were spread in Greece; the belief in which, Balbus,
you <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t8 t10 t12 t13 t14 t17 t19 t23 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> know, ought to be stopped, lest religion should suffer. But you Stoics, so <span class="t6 t9 t18 t26 hoverable">far</span> from

Dionysius, of whom we have before spoken, after he had pillaged the temple of Proserpine at
Locris, <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t15 t17 t18 t19 hoverable">set</span> sail for Syracuse, and, having a fair wind during his voyage, said, with a smile, “See,

wisdom; but, as it grows too late, I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> defer my answer to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">another</span> day. Our argument is of
the greatest importance; it concerns our altars, our hearths, our temples, nay, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> the walls of

our city, which you priests hold sacred; you, who by religion defend Rome better than she is
defended by her ramparts. This is a <span class="t1 t3 t9 t15 t20 t21 t26 t29 hoverable">cause</span> which, while I have life, I think I <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">cannot</span> abandon

There is nothing, replied Cotta, which I desire more than to be confuted. I have not pretended
to decide this point, but to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> you my private sentiments <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> it; and am very sensible of
your <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> superiority in argument. No doubt of it, <span class="t1 t7 t9 t14 t15 t17 t25 t28 hoverable">says</span> Velleius; we have <span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">much</span> to fear from
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> who believes that our dreams are sent from Jupiter, which, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> they are of little weight,
are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> of more importance than the discourse of the Stoics concerning the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of the Gods.
The conversation ended here, and we parted. Velleius judged that the arguments of Cotta
were truest; but those of Balbus seemed to me to have the greater probability.
