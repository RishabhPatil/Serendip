Introduction
Kaivalya, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> itself, means solitary or alone.
The ultimate <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> of Kaivalya is the <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span> understanding of
the reality of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> “I Alone am <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> Existence”.
The Kaivalya Upanishad is an advanced philosophy and is in
reply to the plea of Ashvalayana, already advanced in both
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> and practice. Ashvalayana askes for the <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span>
understanding and realisation of the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> of his non-dual
identity with the Absolute <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> or God.
It is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> known that the <span class="t8 t12 t17 hoverable">wise</span> see their own “self” in all
others and see all others as their own “self”, which, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span>
the apparent duality of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span> means all are one. For many
this understanding has <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> enough.
However, the Kaivalya Upanishad means us to understand
more than just that, hence the <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> for its existence.
The Sage of the Kaivalya Upanishad also knows that The
Singularity of Existence, The Absolute Itself, is not Realised
through that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> alone. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">True</span> Realisation is of the
primal singularity of <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">Existence</span> which is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> origination.
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Realisation arises from the conscious awareness that
this very awareness itself is all there is, all else is an
assumption of the senses and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span>
consciousness. <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">Consciousness</span> is not shared by “others”.
To turn within, away from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> and “others” needs the

refined intuitive discrimination to know that this <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span>
does lie within. Turning <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> is also a decision that needs
the resilient <span class="t4 t7 t12 t16 hoverable">faith</span> to <span class="t6 t9 t13 t15 t17 t18 t23 t28 t29 hoverable">pass</span> alone through all doubt.
The Kaivalya Upanishad talks of the last stage of <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span>
realisation, gaining the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> and understanding that
completes and frees the Realised to emerge Alone from
duality as One, as The Absolute.
Concerning the completion of our journey, it also seems
propitious to consider this Upanishad to help illuminate the
basic motivation and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> of all students. Through grace one
may feel troubled, causing pause for thought, allowing the
insight to arise that something is missing, that this living is not
satisfying our <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> purpose. In our more introspective or
intuitive moments most <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> admit to the feeling that
there is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> their self the seed of a <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> or a nobility of
purpose. The initial impulse to seek <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> is the
germination of this seed. This causes one to turn to a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span>
life. <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">Whether</span> you are then drawn to Teacher, Church,
Temple, Mosque or Synagogue you are being moved to seek
the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> of truth. From then on what is needed is the
nourishment and nurturing of this seed through to fruition,
through to Kaivalya.
Lastly, but of utmost <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> and importance.
Considering the terms solitary, alone, Kaivalya. It must be
understood right from the beginning that these terms,

aloneness and so forth are merely terms of duality in
themselves.
Ironically, these terms are only relevant to the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of duality
and forgetting that we are in right now. You can feel alone
now, this is why the consideration of Absolute Aloneness
causes profound <span class="t28 hoverable">fear</span> or sadness. But, after the proper
Realisation of your Solitary <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">Existence</span> you will never feel or
be alone again, because aloneness will not exist.
Consider, <span class="t28 hoverable">fear</span> itself in all its forms only arises <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span>
duality. This is because duality itself only exists through the
forgetting of our non-dual identity with or as the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span>
Absolute or God. Once the Absolute, God, The primal
singularity of <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">Existence</span> is realised the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of one’s <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span>
is Absolutely Complete.
After this Realisation, Aloneness or Solitary or Kaivalya
does not exist because they are relative terms. All will be
well.

Section 1
1. Then Ashvalayana addressed the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span>
and said: “Teach, O Lord, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span>
of the Absolute, the highest, always

the sins and reaches the Absolute <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span>

“Then Ashvalayana addressed the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> and said

highest”
When Ashvalayana is moved to sound his <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> for
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> and union with the Absolute it is that seed of
Divinity that is maturing. Kaivalya itself is the fruition of
purpose and realisation of life’s journey.
“always cultivated by the good”.
The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of the Absolute which Ashvalayana desires is
that same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> that all the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> and <span class="t8 t12 t17 hoverable">wise</span> cultivate or

The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> are the ones that
can discriminate between transient material <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> and <span class="t20 hoverable">eternal</span>
truth.
The intuition that this <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> exists is the beginning of
wisdom.
“secret”
That described as secret means that understanding that is
subtle and can only come from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> ones own self, arising
from ones own intuition, albeit helped and guided by the Guru
in revealing the subtle <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> thewords of the
scriptures.
“by which a <span class="t8 t12 t17 hoverable">wise</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> drives away instantly all the
sins”
When the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> <span class="t0 t9 t11 t14 t17 t28 hoverable">sin</span> is used, especially <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the Upanishads
its <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> is understood by us to be any action or practice
that might cause forgetting of the Absolute Self or delay ones
inevitable attainment of that truth. There <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be no big <span class="t0 t9 t11 t14 t17 t28 hoverable">sin</span>
or little sin. A <span class="t0 t9 t11 t14 t17 t28 hoverable">sin</span> is just an action or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> that is, for the
moment, in ignorance of the Absolute.
Needless to say “sins” fall away with the <span class="t12 t20 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">wisdom</span> that comes
with truth. Further, abiding in the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> the <span class="t8 t12 t17 hoverable">wise</span> <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span>
naturally “drives away instantly” all further untruth with its
sins.
“and reaches the Absolute <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> than the high”
<span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Truth</span> is seen or discriminated through the cleansed Buddhi or
intellect. This <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Truth</span> of Non-Duality contains the

understanding that the duality of <span class="t23 hoverable">high</span> and low does not exist in
reality, this is indeed the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> that leads to the Realisation of
“The Absolute <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> than the high”.
This is a plea for freedom made by one who is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> weary
because he has realised that this experience of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> does not
reflect the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> truth.
It is for our benefit here that Ashvalayana seeks and receives
the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Truth</span> that sets you <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> and as an example he is willing to
suffer any trial to attain that truth.

2. And to him, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> said, “Know this

devotion and meditation. Not by works,
nor by progeny, nor by wealth, but by
renunciation, some attained immortality”.
“the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> said, Know this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> by means of
faith, yoga, devotion and meditation”
As stated above, this subtle or “secret” knowledge, can only
be known and understood by those with <span class="t4 t7 t12 t16 hoverable">faith</span> and <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t8 t13 t15 t17 t18 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> of the

“Not by works, nor by progeny, nor by wealth”

values of the majority which arise through the delusion of
duality, guided by material face values, which deny the

values to delude us into believing our purpose is the material
“success” of accumulating worldly knowledge, wealth fame
and power.
It is the delusion of duality that causes the seeing of others as
separate existences from ourselves. Duality is the forgetting
of the underlying unity of all existence, this forgetting gives
rise to the <span class="t28 hoverable">fear</span> of inadequacy that causes the need or <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> to
collect material wealth for protection and status. It is only
through duality that inadequacy can be experienced,
inadequacy imagines the need for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> and increase. The

The Kaivalya Upanishad here describes the Ascetic having
undertaken the path of the Sannyasin. Through contemplation,
<span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> and complete disentanglement from the sensual and

This is the decision of the sage. “Having controlled all the

“saluting his own teacher with reverence”.
The sage will always be available for his teachers and his
realisation of unity will contain insight and understanding of
how he or she received that truth.

Here the “lotus of the heart” refers to the <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> intellect or

With Realisation comes the awareness of this singularity or
Non-Duality. That Singularity is seen as This Alone and all
else falls away.

perception of duality with its desires and fears.
The sage of this verse, having Realised the reality of NonDuality and the <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">Consciousness</span> of the Absolute becomes <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span>
“untainted” and “pure” of the impediments of duality.
The sage so liberated has clarity of perception, his
understanding is “clear”.
“without sorrow”.

“Sorrow” is a product of attachment and the taints of duality,
it is a part of this material Creation.
The Realised Sage of this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">verse</span> is “without sorrow” because
due to his clarity of understanding he now sees and renounces
this material <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">Creation</span> along with its sorrows or joys as unreal

delusion of Maya there is an experience <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span>
of duality and a “self”, nevertheless there is but one
<span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">Consciousness</span> so the experience in <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> of a
thinking “self” is in reality merely a projection by the
Absolute “Self”.
This means that the projected experience of a “self” thinking

cannot logically encompass that “Absolute Self” that projects
that very thinking experience.

As stated above all that is manifest, which is this universe, is
the Absolute itself. This universe consists of name and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span>

“the peaceful”.
“peaceful” means <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> from disturbance. Because the
Absolute is the primal singularity of <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> there literally
is not another to cause disturbance. The absolute itself is

The
wonder of the Absolute is that although it is unknowable the

Acknowledging the unreality of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">Creation</span> through renunciation
the Solitary sage meditates to open the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> and intellect to

found, realised and now rests in Reality Alone, the One

Understanding that the Absolute source of all is a singularity
the sage reaches that singularity through Realising his own

Moon Symbolises <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> and the Absolute is the <span class="t14 t24 hoverable">intelligence</span> or
thinking principle itself.
The Sage is no longer Sage. The surrender of self is
complete, the acceptance of the Absolute is unconditional.
The Absolute Alone is now known and accepted with
complete certainty as the one reality. However the Absolute
is experienced, whatever the shape <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> or medium, be it

pleasure or pain, this Absolute Reality is no longer
questioned or denied.

9. He alone is all that was, and all that
will be, the Eternal. Knowing Him, one
transcends death. There is no other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> to
freedom.
“He alone is all that was, and all that will be, the
Eternal”
This statement is the established <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> of the scriptures. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Upon</span>
this <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> is based the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> understanding.
With the Primal Singularity of <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">Existence</span> established it is
empirically observable that nothing new comes into <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span>
and also there is no-thing that leaves or goes out of <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span>
(all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> merely change) <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> the Absolute is “all that
was, and all that will be” <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">Existence</span> is Eternal.
“Knowing Him, one transcends death”
The term “Knowing Him” means to have Realised the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> of
the Absolute. The <span class="t8 t12 t17 hoverable">wise</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> that sees this <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Truth</span> will
understand that all that he is, is but The Absolute Itself
Alone, this is the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> of Non-Duality. Knowing this the
Realised Sage knows himself to be <span class="t20 hoverable">Eternal</span> (“transcends
death”).
“There is no other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> to freedom”

It is immediately understood by the <span class="t8 t12 t17 hoverable">wise</span> that only the truth,
realised in consciousness, can lead that <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> to
freedom. Any understanding, action or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> that does
not consciously encompass the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> of Non-Duality cannot
result in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> freedom, ignorance is a prison because it leads
the <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> to the repetition of the unreal. The
definition of ignorance here is the forgetting of our <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span>
identity with the Non-Dual Absolute or God, the Unity of
Existence.
This means that this Singularity of <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">Existence</span> has to be known
and Realised. Only by becoming fully conscious of this
reality can one escape the <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> of duality, birth and
death.

10. Seeing the Self in all beings, and all
<span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> in the Self, one attains that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span>
Self. Not by any other means.
“Seeing the Self in all beings, and all <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> in the
Self”
Through the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> practice of Meditation, when the Absolute
Self is Realised through perfected discrimination this Self
will be seen in and as all beings, and all <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> as the Self.
This statement is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> because as we have been told in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">verse</span>
(9) above “He alone is all that was, and all that will be,
the Eternal”. The Absolute Self being all <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> then all

beings are the One Self.
“one attains that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self”
The Sage through his Realisation will have attained <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span>

“Not by any other means”
This same <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Truth</span> of the Self cannot be known via the senses or
by deduction or from information or by any means other than
Self Realisation attained through <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> practices.
The <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> here is that freedom is only attained through Self
Realisation. Realisation encompasses the recognition that all
“others” are are but the experience of “This” Solitary
Consciousness.

decision and commitment.
“through repeated friction causing the heat of
knowledge”
The <span class="t8 t12 t17 hoverable">wise</span> Sage, after having cognised the <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> of the
Absolute, he will willingly experience again and again the
heat caused by the friction of increasing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> and

Significantly each encountered experience of the heat of <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span>
replacing ignorance strengthens the courageous and clarifies
will.

The renouncing of the practices of untruth with its <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> for

others based on duality. Gaining the <span class="t4 t7 t12 t16 hoverable">faith</span> to let go of ones
delusions gives rise to the heat of battle in overcoming
uncertainty. The <span class="t8 t12 t17 hoverable">wise</span> will have made a decision to disregard
<span class="t28 hoverable">fear</span> and doubt to gain the Truth.
One <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> cannot serve <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> masters.

12. With his self <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> deluded by false

the jiva who attains satisfaction through the

women, <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> and drink.
“With his self <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> deluded by false <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> or

propensities for retaining ignorance, the extent of which
depends on the individual (“self or jiva”) levels of
consciousness. But all <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> of birth suffer the delusion of
Maya. This waking dream is the delusion of duality causing
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">Creation</span> to appear to have real existence, which further
maintains the ignorance which is the forgetting of our <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span>

all sorts of things”
This jiva, this one deluded through duality sees separate
forms as individual existences. He regards his own <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> as

imagines himself as the “doer” and achiever of his own
desires.
“In the waking <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> it is the jiva who attains

The waking <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> is the experience in <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> of an

his needs. Pleasure is mistakenly seen as gain by those so
deluded by duality and the consequent needs of their own
individual ego. The desires of the ego covered by ignorance
can be limitless, resulting in seeking sex, food, drink,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> and so forth for personal satisfaction and
aggrandisement, the cause for which arises from the
ignorance of duality and their need to assert themselves as
individuals.

13. In the dream-state that jiva feels
pleasure and pain in a sphere of <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span>
<span class="t16 hoverable">created</span> by his own Maya or ignorance.
During the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of deep sleep, when
everything is absorbed (into their causal
state), he is overpowered by tamas or non-

manifestation and comes to exist in his

“In the dream-state that jiva feels pleasure and pain
in a sphere of <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> <span class="t16 hoverable">created</span> by his own Maya or
ignorance”.
The dream <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> is the experience in <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> of living

individual, this deluded jiva consciousness, suffers the same

merely a projection of the <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">Consciousness</span> of Reality.
This is due to the dream <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> being the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span> of that same

“During the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of deep sleep, when everything is

During the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of deep sleep the jiva is divested of attributes
such as delusion, ignorance, individuality, desires and so
forth. In deep sleep one seems as that One Alone, <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> from
desiring and apparently blissful.

This apparent bliss is only due to the unawareness and

It is yourSelf that is the All. You Alone are Solitarily

difficult for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> to encompass. After coming to terms

unchanging, unmoving and Absolute. The apparent
experience of birth sleeping or waking and so forth are just
that, simply the conscious experience of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of

have a traceable <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> unlinked to anything else in
existence.
Likewise the being who is the enjoyer <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have a

mean it was autonomous.
“different from them all am I, the Witness”
With direct reference to “enjoyment” above this statement
confirms that the Non-Dual Absolute <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">Consciousness</span> is That
that is not one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> nor the other “different from them all am
I” because the Absolute is the Singularity that is the witness
and support for all the apparent diversity of creation.

there is not that duality of another to deny the one intention.
The <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> is that the “Eternal Good” is all that Exists. It
is “good” because all must conform correctly to Absolute
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Knowledge</span> because there is no other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of Existence.
“the Sovereign Will”
This statement confirms the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> of “eternal good” because
here “Will” is formed of that very same Absolute <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Knowledge</span>

are the Solitary witnessing <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">Consciousness</span> of these
experiences.
Realising the Absolute as “I” all else can be allowed to fall
away. All that You Alone really are, is the Absolute Alone.
Whatever else comes to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> can be let go of as unreal,
“that” that lets go can be surrendered because this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">verse</span> tells

purity of <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">Consciousness</span> Alone remains.

“In me alone is everything born, in me does
everything rest, and in me is everything dissolved”
“me alone” refers to Absolute Consciousness. The <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span>

“I am more minute than the minute, I am likewise the
greatest of all”.
The <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> here is that the Absolute is beyond measure.
Because the Absolute Alone “is” <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> there is not that

itself the Absolute is beyond thought. being the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span>

“I know all, and am different from all”
The <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> of the statement “I know all” is that the Absolute

It follows that as the Absolute is literally all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> then the
Absolute is different from all things.
“None can know me. I am always the Intelligence”
Being the <span class="t14 t24 hoverable">intelligence</span> principle itself the Absolute is always
beyond being knowable.
This is the description of the Absolute Self. The Absolute is
“All This”. The <span class="t8 t12 t17 hoverable">wise</span> and Realised Sages, understanding that
the Self is unknowable and unthinkable, they surrender their
limited idea of an individual self.

22. I alone am taught in the various Vedas,

There is nothing that is not “I”. Further to this, but also the

the very branch that is the sole support between the seekers

difficult. After Self Realisation the understanding that
assumes duality is profoundly alien.

arising from the ignorance that is the forgetting of the

The Realised Sage does not commit a sin. All labels
themselves are a fundamental error of duality.

The Sage having Realised the Absolute Self will know that
<span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Truth</span> to be the only substance for rest or refuge, all else will
be seen as false and transient.
“One who belongs to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> should
repeat this always or once a day”
The <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> here is that the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Truth</span> once seen needs to be
remembered. It is the forgetting of the unity of the Absolute
that lead to that original ignorance and duality.
Such a <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> leaves behind them all sins just as they leave
behind them the false being of ignorance they appeared to be.
This <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> now resides in the <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> awareness of the
Absolute Self, as such each <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> will be lived according to

Choosing the path of truth, suffering any pain in the process
lead to this greater awareness of the Divine. One commits
completely to that Reality. The unreal is a very real prison.

There are subtle entities, egoism etc. that have a vested
interest in ones subservience. The only <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> for the <span class="t8 t12 t17 hoverable">wise</span> is to
face the pain of struggle valiantly for freedom now or suffer a
disturbing dream forever. Once the Absolute is felt <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t8 t13 t15 t17 t18 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">Love</span>

samsara or repeated transmigration.
Therefore, knowing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> one attains the

attains liberation.
“By means of this, one attains the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> that

By means of the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Truth</span> all untruth is destroyed. To Realise the

<span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">Consciousness</span> of The Absolute which leads back home to

“Therefore, knowing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> one attains the fruit of
Kaivalya or liberation, verily one attains liberation”
The fruits of Kaivalya are the fruits of the acceptance of the
responsibilitiesof “I Alone Exist”.

That heat and pain of struggle is different now. As in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> a

So here, this struggle towards awakening assaulting the bonds
of delusion with the ammunition of knowledge, the weapons
of will and the <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> for <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> at any cost, has caused the
resultant heat to burn away all impediments, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> clarifying
the truth.
By means of this truth, the seed of Kaivalya is carried to
maturation. This <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> gift is honoured. Finally <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> from
any former sins, debts or charges the sufferer of the ignorance
of desire, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span> and birth, is <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> to return to Absolute
<span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">Consciousness</span> Alone.
Here The Kaivalya Upanishad Ends
Kaivalya is less to do with being Alone than it is to do with
Realising ones Solitary responsibility for Realising ones
identity as Absolute <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">Consciousness</span> Alone. Being <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Truth</span> Alone
is the reality, not even a goal. <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Truth</span> Alone sets you free.
After Kaivalya, in the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> of Absolute knowledge, all else
is seen as illusion.
What remains is Solitary undifferentiated completeness.
“That <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> us.
There is no other help.
That <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> illumines the direct path,
the straight path.

There is no need to carry anything.
But this is subtle knowledge,
very difficult”.
