THE BUDDHIST IDEAL

"Eschew all evil: cherish good: cleanse your inmost thoughts--this is the teaching of Buddhas."

INTRODUCTION

  

 section I

THE Dhammapada was accepted at the Council of Asoka in 240 B.C. as a collection of the sayings of Gautama; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> it was not <span class="t0 t2 t16 t18 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">put</span> into writing until some generations had passed, and probably contains accretions of later date.

<span class="t27 t28 hoverable">However</span> that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be, there is no doubt that it breathes the very <span class="t0 t1 t3 t5 t7 t8 t13 t16 t18 t20 t21 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> of the Teacher, and it has always been <span class="t27 hoverable">used</span> in Buddhist lands as a handbook of "devotion" or meditation, in <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whose</span> solemn precepts <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> hear the voice of Sakyamuni summoning them to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of contemplation, of strenuous mind-culture. The world, it tells them, is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> permanence or purpose, other than that of expiation; the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> is "a nest of disease" and the seat of "desire"; the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> itself is subject to decay, and capricious, easily led <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">away</span> after false pursuits.

And so the call to "play the man" rings out with sturdy confidence. All <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> attain, if they will, to happiness and serenity, for, with a modern Stoic, the Buddhist proclaims:

"I am the <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">master</span> of my fate;
      I am the captain of my soul."

Gautama then was no thoroughgoing pessimist; that such a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> was pessimistic at all is due to the age in which he lived. It was the "sub-conscious mind" of his nation, and not his own brave spirit, that shut him in to the belief in a ceaseless flux of "becoming," a weary round of pain and retribution. For, by the sixth century B.C., India had passed from the sunny paganism of the Rig Veda into a more thoughtful and more gloomy phase of her religious development.

There were not wanting heroic spirits who offered a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> of escape, urging <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> to plunge into asceticism or to court the mystic trance. These were the religious leaders of the day, at <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whose</span> feet Gautama sat. Others, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> majority, were not ready for such heroic measures. They tried to square the gods, and to live unmolested, or to forget all in the pleasures of sense or the more subtle joys of the intellect.

To Gautama, all alike seemed "to follow

[p. 11]

wandering fires." How degrading this thraldom to immoral and capricious gods! How empty and unsatisfying this mysticism when shorn of all ethical content! Which is more to be pitied, the grasping priest or the foolish worshipper? Which more deluded, the worldling or the devotee?

To all alike the Dhammapada has a message of warning and encouragement: to the worldling it holds out the promise of a truer wealth and fame (75, 303) and a more blessed family <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> (204-7, 302); to the warrior it offers a higher "chivalry" (270) and a more heroic contest (103, 104); to the philosopher a deeper wisdom than <span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">much</span> speaking (28, 100, 258); to the mystic a purer and more lasting bliss (197-200); to the devotee a more fruitful <span class="t27 hoverable">sacrifice</span> (106 -7); and to the Brahmin a more ennobling service ( section xxvi) and a more compelling authority (73, 74). It is, in fact, possible largely to reconstruct the religious <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of Gautama's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> from the stanzas of the Dhammapada.

For all classes the <span class="t19 hoverable">Buddha</span> has the same message: the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> reality is character; all else are shadows not worth pursuing, for none of them strengthens moral fibre, and all alike are tainted with "desire."

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Like</span> Socrates, he saw in himself a physician of the soul, and at times he resorted to surgery to "stab the <span class="t0 t1 t3 t5 t7 t8 t13 t16 t18 t20 t21 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> broad awake," to call <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> from superstition on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t29 hoverable">hand</span> and materialism

In view of widespread misinterpretation, a literal and accessible translation of this book, therefore, needs no apology. I have worked at the translation throughout with my friend Mr. Wagiswara, himself a Buddhist, and for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span> a Bhikkhu; that fact and the appearance of our translation in this <span class="t14 hoverable">series</span> will vouch for sympathetic treatment in the rendering. It is notoriously difficult to find the exact English equivalents of Eastern terms, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> we trust that the <span class="t0 t1 t3 t5 t7 t8 t13 t16 t18 t20 t21 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> has been truly reproduced, and our version aims rather at accuracy than at elegance. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Great</span> thoughts are best "plain-set," and moreover it is impossible to reproduce the music of the <span class="t25 hoverable">old</span> slokas of Indian poetry. We have referred frequently to Dr. Fausboll's Latin version, and occasionally to Professor Max Muller's edition in "The Sacred Books of the East." Only where the Sinhalese and Chinese commentaries are really illuminating have I referred to them in the notes, for which I am chiefly responsible.

180. By what fault will you lead captive the faultless Buddha, <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whose</span> sphere is Nirvana? In him are no clinging meshes of desire to lead him captive.

"Patience and fortitude is the supreme asceticism: Nirvana is above all," <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">say</span> the Buddhas. He is no recluse who harms others: nor is he who causes grief an ascetic (samana).

185. Hurt none by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">word</span> or deed, be consistent in well-doing: be moderate in food, dwell in solitude, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> yourselves to meditation--this is the advice of Buddhas.

186. Not by a shower of gold is satisfaction of the senses found: "little pleasure, lasting pain," so thinks the sage.

187. The follower of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t19 hoverable">Buddha</span> finds no delight <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> in <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> pleasures: but his joy is in the destruction of desire (tanha).

190. But he who goes for sanctuary to the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha looks in his wisdom for the four noble truths:

THE PATH

HAPPINESS is for Gautama, as for Aristotle, "the bloom <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> virtue." The path which leads to the Supreme Bliss is the path of morality defined as the Noble Eightfold Path. If a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> follow this, he is happy here and hereafter.

It consists of:

<span class="t27 hoverable">Right</span> Views,

<span class="t27 hoverable">Right</span> Aspirations,

<span class="t27 hoverable">Right</span> Speech,

<span class="t27 hoverable">Right</span> Action,

<span class="t27 hoverable">Right</span> Livelihood,

<span class="t27 hoverable">Right</span> Effort,

<span class="t27 hoverable">Right</span> Mindfulness,

<span class="t27 hoverable">Right</span> Contemplation.

[paragraph continues] This is described by Gautama as a Middle Path between the extreme of sensuality on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t29 hoverable">hand</span> and asceticism on the other; or between superstitious credulity and sceptical materialism. It is a truly noble ideal: <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> forget that "Righteousness" throughout is Buddhistically defined: e.g. "Right Views"

Again, "Right Contemplation" is the practice of Samadhi, concentration of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> Buddhist ideas, such as the above. The <span class="t6 t9 t22 t29 hoverable">highest</span> "Livelihood," again, is to live <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the alms of the faithful.

THE ELEPHANT

THE elephant is the symbol in Buddhism of endurance and solitary strength.

320. I will endure abuse as the elephant endures the arrow in the battle: <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> is the crowd.

322. Noble are the tamed mules; noble the blood-horses of Sindh, and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> elephants of war: better is he who has tamed himself.

323. Not by bridling them will <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> journey to the unknown shore (Nirvana), but by bridling himself.

327. Be ye zealous: guard your thoughts. As an elephant sunk in the mud extricate yourselves from the clutches of evil.

328. If you can find a dutiful friend to go with you, a righteous and prudent <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> not caring for hardships, go with him deliberately.

DESIRE

TANHa (desire) is defined as the hankering after pleasure, or existence, or success (or all three). (Mahavagga xvi. 20.) It is the germ from which springs all <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> misery: birth, <span class="t25 hoverable">old</span> age, and suffering. To be rid of Tanha is to be free of pain, to <span class="t5 hoverable">pass</span> into the Beyond, the painless dream-world of Nirvana.

334. As the "maluwa" creeper, so spreads the desire of the sluggard. From birth to birth he leaps <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> a monkey seeking fruit.

335. Whoso is subdued by this sordid clinging desire, his sorrows wax more and more, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> "birana" grass after rain.

336. But his sorrows drop off <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> from the lotus leaf, who subdues this sordid, powerful desire.

337. I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> you this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> counsel, all ye who are gathered here: cut out desire as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> digs up the grass to find the fragrant root. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Let</span>

not Mara break you again and again as the river breaks the rushes.

338. A tree, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> it be cut down, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> springs up again, if its roots are safe and firm: <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> sorrow, if it be not uprooted, springs repeatedly to birth.

339. If man's desires flow unchecked, the waves of his lust and craving bear him off--misguided one!

340. Everywhere flow the streams; everywhere the creeper sprouts and takes hold. If <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thou</span> seest this creeper growing, be wise! pluck it out by the roots.

342. Dogged by lust, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> double <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> a hunted hare. Fast bound in its fetters, they go through <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> ages to misery.

343. Dogged by lust, they double <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> a hunted hare.

344. Whoso has left the tangle of home-life for the solitude of the jungle, and goes back to it, regard him thus: "Lo, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> who was freed, and ran back to his chains."

345. Iron and wood and hemp--these sages call not heavy bonds, but rather <span class="t7 hoverable">love</span> of bejewelled women, and the care for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">children</span> and wives.

346. This is a heavy bond indeed: <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span>

347. Some again there are who fall into the meshes of their own lust as the spider falling into her own net: <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> this the wise cut through, leaving sorrow behind, with no backward glance.

348. Lay aside past, future, and present, escaping the world: wholly freed in mind, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thou</span> <span class="t2 t4 t5 t9 t11 t16 t22 t24 t26 hoverable">shalt</span> not again return to birth and <span class="t25 hoverable">old</span> age.

351. This will be his last body, who has reached the goal, who is fearless, detached, and un-blameable: who has pulled out the rivets of existence.

352. He who is detached and not grasping, a clever student of the <span class="t0 t8 t12 t15 t19 t23 t25 hoverable">law</span> and its meaning, knowing the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">words</span> and their order, he is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the enlightened; this is his last birth.

The gift of the <span class="t0 t8 t12 t15 t19 t23 t25 hoverable">Law</span> surpasses <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> gift; the savour of the <span class="t0 t8 t12 t15 t19 t23 t25 hoverable">Law</span> surpasses <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> savour; the pleasure of the <span class="t0 t8 t12 t15 t19 t23 t25 hoverable">Law</span> surpasses <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> pleasure.

367. He who clings not to self-hood and to existence, but mourns at the vanity of this fleeting world, he is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Bhikkhu.

368. The Bhikkhu who lives kindly and trusts in Buddha's Teaching he approaches Nirvana, the calm and blissful <span class="t7 t10 t15 t25 hoverable">end</span> of rebirth.

369. Bale out the ship, O Bhikkhu, then will it go lightly; cut the thongs of lust and hate; so wilt <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thou</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> to Nirvana.

372. There is no meditation apart from wisdom; there is no wisdom apart from meditation. Those in whom wisdom and meditation meet are not <span class="t6 t9 t18 t26 hoverable">far</span> from Nirvana.

373. <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> pleasure is his who enters into solitude, the Bhikkhu who is calmed and sees the <span class="t0 t8 t12 t15 t19 t23 t25 hoverable">law</span> with the seeing eye:

374. Whenever he ponders the beginning and the <span class="t7 t10 t15 t25 hoverable">end</span> of the elements of being, he finds joy and bliss; nectar it is to those who know.

375. This is the beginning in my teaching for

[p. 78]

a wise Bhikkhu; self-mastery, contentment, and control by the precepts: to cultivate those who are noble, righteous, and zealous friends;

376. To be hospitable and courteous, this is to be glad and to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> an <span class="t7 t10 t15 t25 hoverable">end</span> of sorrow.

THE BRAHMIN

383. PLAY the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> and stem the flood of passion! Cast off your lusts, O Brahmin; having <span class="t6 t10 t15 hoverable">known</span> the ending of the perishable, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thou</span> knowest the imperishable, O Brahmin.

384. When the Brahmin has travelled the twofold path of meditation, then indeed his chains fall off him, for he knows the truth.

385. Him I call the Brahmin whom desire assails not from <span class="t5 t7 hoverable">within</span> nor from without, in whom is no fear, he is indeed free.

386. Him I call Brahmin who is meditative, clean of heart, solitary, who has done his duty and got rid of taints, who has reached the goal of effort.

387. The <span class="t0 t8 t11 t14 t23 t25 t28 hoverable">sun</span> shines by day, the moon lights up the night; radiant is the soldier in his panoply, radiant the Brahmin in his meditation; but the <span class="t19 hoverable">Buddha</span> in his brightness is radiant <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> and night.

389. Do no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> to a Brahmin; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">let</span> not the Brahmin return <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> for evil. Woe to him who kills a Brahmin; yea, rather, woe to that Brahmin who loses his temper!

390. It is no slight benefit to a Brahmin when he learns to hold his impulses in check; from whatever motive <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> temper is controlled, by that control grief is truly soothed.

391. By whomsoever no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> is done in deed, or word, or thought, him I call a Brahmin who is guarded in these three.

392. As the Brahmin honours the burnt-sacrifice, so do <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thou</span> honour him, from whomsoever is learnt the <span class="t0 t8 t12 t15 t19 t23 t25 hoverable">law</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> Buddha.

393. Not by matted locks, nor by lineage, nor by caste is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> a Brahmin; he is the Brahmin in whom are <span class="t3 t7 t9 t10 t15 t19 t22 hoverable">truth</span> and righteousness and purity.

394. What boots your tangled hair, O fool, what avails your garment of skins? You have adorned the outer parts, <span class="t5 t7 hoverable">within</span> you are full of uncleanness.

395. A <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> clothed in cast-off rags, lean, with knotted veins, meditating alone in the forest, him I call a Brahmin.

Not him do I call Brahmin who is merely born of a Brahmin mother; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> him

397. Him I call a Brahmin who has cut the bonds, who does not thirst for pleasures, who has left behind the hindrances.

398. Whoso has cut the cable, and the rope and the chain with all its links, and has pushed aside the bolt, this wise <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> I call a Brahmin.

413. Who is clear as the moon, pure, and limpid, and serene, who has quenched his thirst for life;

through it and got beyond it, who is meditative and supplies no fuel to the fires of lust and doubt, him I call a Brahmin.

415. Who in this life, deserting his lusts, goes from home into solitude, and has quenched lust, and with it the desire to be reborn;

NOTES

1, 2. THESE stanzas contain <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> ideas which are of the very warp and woof of Buddhism:

(a) The view depends <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the point of view;

(b) <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">Thought</span> is potent in influencing man's destiny.

The Chinese Commentary illustrates both these ideas: <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Two</span> merchants listened to the Buddha's preaching; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> was delighted, the other angry: <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> hear what they are prepared to hear. Soon after <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> was killed, the other became King: so potent is thought!

9, 10. The <span class="t19 hoverable">Buddha</span> often <span class="t27 hoverable">used</span> a play <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">words</span> to arrest men's attention and help their memory. The Pali of these stanzas contains a pun of this kind, which <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">cannot</span> be imitated in English: Kasavam <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t14 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">means</span> either the yellow robe of the mendicant, or impurity, stain, sin.

11, 12. The <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t7 t10 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> of Gautama as a preacher lay largely in this directing of men's efforts: the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> reality is character; this and this alone is man's business <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> earth.

All else are "shadows" not worth pursuing. Cf. St. John's words: "Little children, flee idols" (i.e. "shadows"), 1 John v, 21. So St. Paul speaks of covetousness as "idolatry"--the pursuit of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> "shadow," Mammon (Col. iii, 5).

When the Buddhist puts on the yellow robe, he symbolises his belief that "virtue is the truest wealth": the gold of character is alone worth striving after. (Cf. Dhammapada, 75 and note.) On the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> of his ordination (upasampada) the candidate adorns himself with all the jewellery he can obtain, and doffs it only to don the yellow robe.

Here and Hereafter: i.e. in this birth and the next. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Man</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be reborn <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> earth, or in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of the

Tormented when he goes to hell. The Buddhist Temples are full of frescoes of these torments: <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> who have killed animals are being slowly devoured by them; other sinners are being forced by demon torturers to climb spiky trees, or burnt in fires most realistically drawn, or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> to swallow balls of red-hot iron; low-caste <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> who have offended the high castes are being crushed by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> rocks!

The Buddha's own discourses contain minute detail of such torments. It is not clear whether he was using an argumentum ad hominem, or really believed in a hereafter of physical torment. In any case his moral code has been strangely perverted in modern Buddhism.

18. The reward for virtue is twofold--the approval of conscience and a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> rebirth.

19. Cf. Matt. xxiii, 2; John x, 12.

20. The <span class="t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t12 t15 t19 t20 t23 t25 hoverable">holy</span> ones: Arahats, those who have attained. The sentence means: "he is on his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> to Nirvana."

21. Amatapadam: lit. "The endless or deathless state" (Fausboll). Nirvana is defined by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> such phrases in the Dhammapada--sometimes negative, as here; sometimes positive, as in 23--"highest freedom." Whatever the Supreme Bliss be, it is unlike all <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> experience save that of the Arahat.

Rhys Davids translates "ambrosia, or nectar."

As it were dead: i.e. spiritually or morally dead. Cf. "Let the dead bury their dead," Matt. viii, 22, and "The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of the fool is worse than death," Ecclus. xxii, 11.

22. The lot of the Noble. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">word</span> "Aryo" meant in Gautama's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> Nobleman, or Aryan. He defined the nobleman anew, making nobility consist not in birth, but in conduct. Then he developed the <span class="t6 t13 t14 t25 t27 hoverable">meaning</span> till it stood for Arahats--the experts in his system, those who have attained.

23. Meditation: jhanam--that ecstatic contemplation in which the mind, rapt from the sounds and sights of the

[p. 87]

ordinary world, concentrates itself <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> some single object or idea; this leads to serenity and a unique bliss, anticipation of Nirvana.

<span class="t6 t9 t22 t29 hoverable">Highest</span> freedom. Nirvana is complete freedom from: (1) The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> and suffering; (2) Desire and other taints.

25. An island: i.e. Nirvana.

Self-control, temperance. Buddhism makes <span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">much</span> of the "cardinal virtues."

26. The Buddhist motto <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to be "Strive <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> ceasing."

27. The joy which is born of meditation plays a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> in Buddhist psychology and ethics. (Cf. Rhys Davids' Early Buddhism, pp. 62-5.)

28. Contrast this somewhat Epicurean attitude with St. Paul's exhortation "Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep" (Rom. xii, 15).

The Buddhist position is in reality midway between the Epicurean and the Christian; it is stoical: the attitude to be assumed towards the "crowd" is either mettam, benevolence if (one's own salvation being certain) <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> can help them: or it is upekha, detachment. "What can't be cured <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> be endured." Mudita, sympathy, and Karuna, pity, are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> duties, but it is no use wasting those <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the blinded and foolish crowd. (Cf. 61, 64.)

Sakra: i.e. Indra, a high <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">god</span> of Hinduism whom Buddhism has relegated to the rank of an archangel, ruling the Tavatimsa heaven. He is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to have been a young Brahmin who for his zeal in doing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> was reborn as Sakra.

He is regarded by Buddhists as a kind of recording angel. (Childers.)

31. Bhikkhu. The "religious" of Buddhism is <span class="t4 t18 t22 hoverable">neither</span> "priest" nor "monk" in the strict sense, for he offers no sacrifice, and he lives not alone, but either with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> others, or with the "community."

The greater and the lesser bonds: all those "trammels" which bind him to the phenomenal world; all that affects his senses.

142. Buddhism--so often labelled pessimistic--is striking in the genial attitude it takes towards asceticism.

150. A citadel of bones. There are occasional gleams of grim humour in the Buddhist books: the following story illustrates both the "law of apperception" and the Buddhist attitude to the body.

The allegory that underlies them is this: The Builder is Desire (Tanha) the <span class="t1 t3 t9 t15 t20 t21 t26 t29 hoverable">cause</span> of rebirth: the seeker tried <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> to find this cause; at the moment of his enlightenment it flashed into his mind, "If desire be dead, then there is <span class="t15 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">nothing</span> to bind <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> to the wheel of existence."

But the underlying idea in St. James, of loyalty to the King, is of course not present to the Buddhist mind.

178. Universal empire: the height of worldly ambition. Conversion: i.e. the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> step towards Nirvana, when the attention is fixed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the Supreme Bliss.

182. The Buddha, being free of all taints or germs of rebirth, has no crack in his armour through which he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be wounded: i.e. he has no <span class="t1 t3 t9 t15 t20 t21 t26 t29 hoverable">cause</span> of rebirth.

183. The ideal is not, as is often said, merely negative: it is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> positive and inward.

In Ceylon, Buddhists look wistfully for the coming Buddha--Metteyya or Maitri--the Loving One. In Japan they worship Amida Buddha--an ideal.

The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">word</span> translated "fortitude" is "kantibalam," patience-strength, that blending of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> qualities, passive and active, Eastern and Western, which is as rare as it is beautiful.

208. The cold clear moonlight of this simile is symbolic of the Buddhist ideal.

212, 213. Buddhism teaches benevolence to all, attachment to none. It is a monastic ideal, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be paralleled from such books as the Imitatio Christi.

There is, however, a vital difference: the Buddhist Bhikkhu is to shun society that <span class="t15 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">nothing</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> mar his self-culture: the Christian monk that he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be "familiar with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> alone, and with His Angels." When Prince Siddhartha (afterwards the Buddha) heard of the birth of his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> Rahula, and they tried to <span class="t22 hoverable">bring</span> him back, he is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to have remarked: "That is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> more bond to be cut." The "Great Renunciation" involved no less than this.

218. The Ineffable. The <span class="t19 hoverable">Buddha</span> describes Nirvana probably from his own experience of that ecstatic joy which is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to be the reward of deep meditation.

254, 255. We have followed the Sinhalese scholar, Mr. James D'Alwis, in this translation: he is supported by the Commentary. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Another</span> possible rendering is: "No <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> outside the Buddhist community can walk through the air, but only a samana" (Fausboll). But this taxes the construction too severely, and as Professor Max Muller says, <span class="t19 hoverable">Buddha</span> did not encourage the display of miraculous power.

264. Cf. Imitatio Christi, bk.

Samano, before Gautama's day, meant "ascetic," being derived from the root "sram"--to <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t7 t10 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> hard, to do penance.

264-9. These stanzas contain a play on the words: Gautama is giving <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> definitions of current terms. It is hardly possible to render these in English: perhaps in 264-5 the use of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">word</span> "religious" as both noun and adjective is a fair analogy from Christian monasticism.

As in mediaeval Europe, so in ancient India, all "nobles" (Aryans) were, warriors.

273. The four truths: suffering: its cause: its cure: the eightfold path of escape.

The seer: cakkhuma, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> who has the eye for truth: the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> of insight.

(Cf. Christ's words: "My judgment is just, because I seek not Mine own will.")

276. Blessed Ones: Tathagata, "those who have arrived," or reached Nirvana.

277-9. "All is passing": <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of the leading tenets of Heraclitus and the Orphists, who belong to the same century as the <span class="t19 hoverable">Buddha</span> (sixth century B.C).

286. Cf. the parable of the Rich Fool, and St. James: "Go to now, ye that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">say</span> to-day or to-morrow we will go into the city, and spend a year there... whereas ye <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">know</span> not what <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> be on the morrow " (iv, 13, 14).

294. The Commentator explains this curious <span class="t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">verse</span> as follows: The Mother is lust: the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t28 hoverable">Father</span> self-will: the Kings are heresies--two extremes on either side of the middle path (cf. Introductory Note,  section xx); the Kingdom is sensuality (cf. 97).

295. The five roads are lust, hatred, disturbance of mind, sloth, and doubt.

301. The principal objects of meditation.

302. Hard is the community life: reading samanasamvaso with Max Muller and the Chinese version, instead of 'samanasamvaso (= asamanasamvaso) with Fausboll and the Sinhalese.

The wanderer in the world: i.e. the layman.

307. Suffering is the blight <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> sin.

310. Therefore... Cf. the simple authority of the seventh commandment, "Thou <span class="t2 t4 t5 t9 t11 t16 t22 t24 t26 hoverable">shalt</span> not commit adultery," and of Christ's <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">words</span> to the woman <span class="t19 hoverable">taken</span> in adultery, "Go and <span class="t26 hoverable">sin</span> no more."

311. "Corruptio optimi pessima."

324. Dhanapalako: i.e. guardian of wealth.

340. The streams: sensations.

The creeper: passion.

344. The pun on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">word</span> vanam (forest and lust) is repeated here: "tangle" perhaps expresses both meanings.

353. Spoken, <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">according</span> to the Commentary, when the <span class="t19 hoverable">Buddha</span> was on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> to Benares, and the Brahmin Upaka sceptically asked him who was his Teacher, and what the <span class="t1 t3 t9 t15 t20 t21 t26 t29 hoverable">cause</span> of his serenity and joy. Here Gautama claims omniscience: elsewhere he claims to be the only Teacher: " Non seulement Cakyamuni est source de verite, mais il est la source unique" (De la Vallee Poussin, Bouddhisme, p. 138). (Cf. Mahavagga i, 6, 8.)

356-9. As weeds spoil a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> harvest, so these passions

370. The five bonds to be cut are egoism, doubt, false asceticism, lust, and hatred. The five to be left off are longing for higher states of birth, for still higher ones, self-will, want of purpose, and ignorance. The five to be <span class="t19 hoverable">taken</span> are faith, manliness, mindfulness, deep meditation, and wisdom. (Commentary.)

"He who has crossed the flood" = Oghatinna.

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Take</span> five more. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Man</span> is destined to be yoked, if not by sin, then by duty. (Cf. "Whose service is perfect freedom.")

For he knows... Cf.

385. Lit. "In whom is <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> <span class="t4 t18 t22 hoverable">neither</span> near bank nor far": i.e. <span class="t4 t18 t22 hoverable">neither</span> noticing external objects by attending to them, nor letting his desires go out to seek them. (Commentary.)

387. The face of the seer is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to shine.

388. Deriving Brahmano from the root vah--or bah--to <span class="t0 t2 t16 t18 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">put</span> away.

394. Cf. Luke xi, 39; Matt. xxiii, 27.

398. The cable is Dosa, hatred; the chain with its links is Tanha, desire in all its forms; the bolt is Moha, infatuation, or folly.

395. This stanza seems to have a Brahminical origin: unless we lay all the stress on meditating.

405. Fixed or moving creatures, <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">according</span> to the Sinhalese Commentary, refers either to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> or to animals.

APPENDIX

  

THE BUDDHIST IDEAL

  

(ARAHATSHIP OR NIRVaNA)

  

AS DEPICTED IN THE DHAMMAPADA

THE "ambrosial (or deathless) path," Nirvana, is the prize which these stanzas hold out to the strenuous: this is at once the goal of effort and its cessation, a calm haven after strenuous voyaging. [**] The seer speaks with a quiet rapture and a serene assurance which convince us as we read, that whether it is Gautama himself who speaks, or whether it is the collective voice of his followers, here is in any case the utterance of a real experience of the soul. Can it be that these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> entered behind the veil of sense and time, and that their voices ring down the ages from that mysterious Beyond to which the mystics of all ages have aspired?

We <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">cannot</span> say; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> it is very clear that if the metaphysical Nirvana is a fantasy, the ethical Nirvana is real enough: and Gautama was above all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> an ethical teacher. That

[p. 103]

we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> understand Nirvana from a perusal of those pages is not likely; that it will attract Western thinkers is not wholly to be desired; but we can at least study the ethical experience of which Nirvana is but the description and the attempted explanation: and a grasp of what Arahatship <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t14 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">means</span> is essential to the understanding of Buddhism. The Arahat is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> who, through obedience to the preaching of Buddha, has reached that calm state when the will no longer struggles, but is unified and at rest.

As the eagle, after <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> strain of upward flight, stays poised in mid-air, so the seer reaches the calm and severe heights of character. This is Nirvana in the present world: and Nirvana hereafter <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be more mysterious, but it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> be of the same kind.

Very <span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">much</span> as the Christian, experiencing "the peace that passes understanding," interprets in the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> of this experience the serenity and calm of the Hereafter, so the Buddhist "saint," having <span class="t6 t10 t15 hoverable">known</span> the quiet and serenity of the unified will, projects this experience into the future.

To both alike this future is "ineffably sublime"; <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">words</span> fail <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> when they attempt to speak of the Beyond: and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> we can piece <span class="t16 t21 hoverable">together</span> a picture of their inmost thoughts from such fragmentary descriptions of their experience as they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">let</span> fall.

Arahatship and Nirvana, then, <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> ideal, and it is with this that the Dhammapada is concerned.

We have seen that Nirvana is ineffable (stanza 218 and note); but we have <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> to remember that it can be experienced here and now. In stanza 402 we read:

"He is the Brahmin who in this very <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> knows the <span class="t7 t10 t15 t25 hoverable">end</span> of sorrow, who has laid the burden aside and is free." [**]

For whilst "the burden" is ultimately bodily existence, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> it is the sinfulness and egoism and pride of the flesh which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> that burden so intolerable: the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> is in fact a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> servant but a bad master, and he who masters his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> is already as it were freed from it.

"Happy is he," <span class="t1 t7 t9 t14 t15 t17 t25 t28 hoverable">says</span> the Digha Nikaya, "who is free of lust and beyond its power: the <span class="t6 t9 t22 t29 hoverable">highest</span> bliss is freedom from pride and self-will."

"There is no sorrow <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> existence, no bliss <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> Nirvana," <span class="t1 t7 t9 t14 t15 t17 t25 t28 hoverable">says</span> the Dhammapada.

"The flesh lusteth against the spirit, and the <span class="t0 t1 t3 t5 t7 t8 t13 t16 t18 t20 t21 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> against the flesh, cries St. Paul...Unhappy <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> that I am! Who <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> deliver me from this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> of death?"

These and similar passages are a cry for deliverance; and both teachers insist <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> truth, that man's bodily life, in so <span class="t6 t9 t18 t26 hoverable">far</span> as it is dominated by self-will and lust, is an <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span>

[p. 105]

to be escaped at any cost. <span class="t4 t18 t22 hoverable">Neither</span> is Manichean: it is not the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> that is evil, but the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> enslaved by the tyranny of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> desires.

And for both teachers it is the perversity of the "flesh" that shapes the ideal of escape; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> longs after the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of dissolution, and the other believes that he will be "clothed upon" with a "glorified body" hereafter. [**]

The salient feature of the Buddhist ideal is freedom:

"Him I call Brahmin who has cut the bonds, who thirsts not for pleasure, who has left behind the hindrances."

(See 397 and <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t9 t12 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">note</span> on 398.)

The phrase "highest freedom" occurs more than once in these stanzas as a synonym for Nirvana, and, as Mrs. Rhys Davids has shown, it is this aspect of Nirvana which is most frequently hymned in the Psalms of the Sisters, that remarkable collection of verses attributed to the women-elders of the Sangha. [*+] (Cf. Dhammapada, 90, 92, 93, 96, etc.)

Inasmuch as this "highest freedom" is escape from lust and other "bonds," it is an

[p. 106]

ideal for this life: inasmuch as it is escape from the round of rebirths it is an ideal for the future: here Arahatship passes over into Nirvana. [**]

And in both alike the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> of escape lies in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> of man:

"All that we are by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Mind</span> is wrought,
 Fashioned and fathered by our Thought." [**]

The Arahat has mastered his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> (that "frail and fickle thing" that in the worldling "leaps hither and thither, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> a monkey seeking fruit)"; and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> he is already free from the tyranny of the flesh (cf. 89). For it is the mental "bonds"--lust, pride, self-will--which have bound him through the <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> waste of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span> to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> after another; and it is "knowledge" which sets him free:

"He is the Brahmin indeed who... has reached the <span class="t7 t10 t15 t25 hoverable">end</span> of rebirths, the sage <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whose</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> is perfect, and who is perfect with all perfection."

This freedom of Nirvana is envisaged as Rest: and there is in these stanzas a cry for rest which runs through all the Buddhist books <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> some pathetic fugue: a desire so passionate as to be almost unintelligible to Western minds.

"All is fleeting, all is unreal, all is sorrowful." (277-9.)
 "There is no sorrow, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> to existence: no bliss <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> Nirvana, the Supreme Rest."

Worldly existence is wholly evil; but <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> is free to cultivate the "otherworldly" frame of mind, and be at peace. For Buddhism is in a sense eudaemonistic; it does not flout man's desire to be happy: only it defines this happiness in terms of inward peace and self-control.

Section XV of the Dhammapada is the Buddhist analogue of the Beatitudes of Jesus, and, as an ideal of the Happy Life, ranks high indeed.

It is an ideal of kindliness and serenity, of peace and unity, which is very winsome: it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be hard to pick a quarrel with the exponents of such a life!

To the Christian it seems none the less an ideal more passive and stoical, less loving and mystical than that of Jesus; and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> we <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">cannot</span> but rejoice that the East has had this ideal so <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> before it. To the Karma-haunted millions of India it has shone with a steady and alluring radiance, in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> past more potent than to-day, but <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> now embedded in their subconsciousness.

Its calm and cool attractiveness is beautifully

symbolised in the poetic imagery of the Dhammapada:

"The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> shines <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> the moon escaped from clouds, he is pure as some unruffled lake."

[paragraph continues] and Sariputta wins the Master's approval by his reply:

"When a Bhikkhu masters his <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t16 t19 t22 t23 t25 t26 hoverable">heart</span> (cittam) and does not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">let</span> it <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">master</span> him."

This scene is most suggestive, for it throws

[p. 109]

into strong contrast Buddhist and Christian Ethics, and further it leads us into the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t16 t19 t22 t23 t25 t26 hoverable">heart</span> of a vexed and difficult problem.

With regard to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> point, it is sufficient to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">say</span> here that Buddhism teaches a rigorous and calm self-mastery, Christianity demands a passionate self-surrender.

With regard to the second, we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> state the problem thus: Is Nirvana a social ideal? Or is it an ideal of solitude and forgetfulness? The answer seems to be that Buddhism holds out no promise of the reunion of emancipated "souls"; Nirvana is the cessation of all personal existence: <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> the experience of the peace and joy of Noble Companionship--such companionship and communion of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> as is here depicted--is too <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> not to be desired. And this desire has tinged the ideal picture of the Beyond: in spite of metaphysics the ethical, asserts itself

"Good is the Vision of the Noble" (i.e. Arahats).
 "Good is their company." (206.)
 "A loyal friend is the truest kinsman:
 Nirvana is the greatest Bliss." (204.)

To sum up the Buddhist position <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the question of "Society and Solitude" is no easy task; but we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> express it tentatively thus: At <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> solitude is essential:

More than this is a mob."

[p. 110]

[paragraph continues] And as the Dhammapada says,

"Even for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> benefit to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">another</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">let</span> no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> imperil his own benefit." (166.)

But if an Arahat is to be found, his society can do <span class="t15 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">nothing</span> but good: <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">let</span> the Bhikkhu resort to him. If there are a company of Arahats, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">let</span> them rejoice in communion and fellowship. And hereafter

Nirvana is "the unknown shore." (323.)
 It is "the solitude which it is hard to love." (88.)

[paragraph continues] With all his kindliness and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> geniality <span class="t19 hoverable">Buddha</span> does not disguise the fact that victory will be purchased at a heavy cost:

"One is the road leading to wealth: <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">another</span> is that leading to Nirvana."

[paragraph continues] To win to the goal will mean asceticism all along the line:

"Cut out the bonds...
 Play the man...
 Travel stoutly alone..."

[paragraph continues] Such are his rallying-cries.

For the "Path of Safety" is beset with "evil beasts." And to win across "the torrent" to the safety of the "other side" needs courage and strenuous effort. And, having won through, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> will find a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> solitude, a peace, a freedom, only to be purchased by ceasing to be. Such is Nirvana in the fullest sense.

Freedom; Safety; Rest: Calmness; Kindliness;

OF NIBBANA

  

Now Nibbana, which is reckoned as beyond these worlds, is to be realised through the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> belonging to the Four Paths. It is the object of those Paths, and of their Fruits. It is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Nibbana, in that it is a "departure" from that craving which is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Vana, lusting. This Nibbana is in its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> single, but for purposes of logical treatment it is twofold, namely, the element of Nibbana, wherewith is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> remaining stuff of life, and the element <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> that remainder. So, too, when divided into modes, it is threefold--namely, Void, Signless, and Absolute Content.
