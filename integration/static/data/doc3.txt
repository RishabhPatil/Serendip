The author of the hymns which are attributed to Or-

pheus describes in the most precise manner the affinity,
or rather the identity, of Hercules with the Sun.
The
Phoenicians have consequently preserved the tradition that
Hercules was the Sun-god, and that his twelve labors

represented the journey of this luminary through the
twelve signs of the zodiac. Porphyrius, born in Phoenicia,
makes the same assertion.

"The Egyptians," <span class="t1 t7 t9 t14 t15 t17 t25 t28 hoverable">says</span> Plutarch, "thought that Hercules
had his seat in the Sun, and that he travelled with it
around the world." The scholiast of Hesiod tells us <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span>
"that the zodiac, in which the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t14 t23 t25 t28 hoverable">Sun</span> accomplishes its annual course, is the real career which Hercules travels over
in the fable of the twelve labors, and that by his
marriage
with Hebe, the goddess of youth, we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> understand
the year which renews itself at the <span class="t7 t10 t15 t25 hoverable">end</span> of each revolution."

It is

evident that

if

Hercules

is

the Sun, as

is

shown by

the above-cited authorities, the fable of the twelve labors
is a solar fable which can have reference
only to the twelve
months and to the twelve signs, of which the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t14 t23 t25 t28 hoverable">Sun</span> travels

over <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> in each month.
