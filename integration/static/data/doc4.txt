PREFACE

By W. Y. EVANS-WENTZ, M.A., D.Litt., D.Sc.
<span class="t0 t6 t8 t9 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t22 t23 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Jesus</span> College, Oxford; Author of
THE TIBETAN <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">BOOK</span> OF THE DEAD,
TIBET'S <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">GREAT</span> YOGI MILAREPA,
TIBETAN YOGA AND SECRET DOCTRINES, etc.

The value of Yogananda's AUTOBIOGRAPHYis greatly enhanced by the
<span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that it is one of the few books in English about the <span class="t8 t12 t17 hoverable">wise</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span>
of India which has been written, not by a journalist or foreigner,
but by one of their own race and training--in short, a <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">book</span> ABOUT
yogis BY a yogi. As an eyewitness recountal of the extraordinary
lives and powers of modern Hindu saints, the <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">book</span> has importance
both timely and timeless. To its illustrious author, whom I have
had the pleasure of knowing both in India and America, may every
reader render due appreciation and gratitude. His unusual life-document
is certainly one of the most revealing of the depths of the Hindu
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> and heart, and of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> wealth of India, ever to be
published in the West.

It has been my privilege to have met one of the sages <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span>
life-history is herein narrated-Sri Yukteswar Giri. A likeness of
the venerable saint appeared as part of the frontispiece of my TIBETAN
YOGA AND SECRET DOCTRINES. {FN1-1} It was at Puri, in Orissa, on

the Bay of Bengal, that I encountered Sri Yukteswar. He was then the
<span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> of a quiet ashrama near the seashore there, and was chiefly
occupied in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> training of a group of youthful disciples.
He expressed keen interest in the welfare of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> of the
United States and of all the Americas, and of England, too, and
questioned me concerning the distant activities, particularly those
in California, of his chief disciple, Paramhansa Yogananda, whom
he dearly loved, and whom he had sent, in 1920, as his emissary to
the West.

Sri Yukteswar was of gentle mien and voice, of pleasing presence,
and worthy of the veneration which his followers spontaneously
accorded to him. Every <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> who knew him, <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> of his own
community or not, held him in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> esteem. I vividly recall
his tall, straight, ascetic figure, garbed in the saffron-colored
garb of one who has renounced worldly quests, as he stood at the
entrance of the hermitage to give me welcome. His hair was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span>
and somewhat curly, and his face bearded. His <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> was muscularly
firm, but slender and well-formed, and his step energetic. He had
chosen as his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> of earthly abode the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">holy</span> <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">city</span> of Puri, whither
multitudes of pious Hindus, representative of every province of
India, come daily on pilgrimage to the famed Temple of Jagannath,
"Lord of the World." It was at Puri that Sri Yukteswar closed his
mortal eyes, in 1936, to the scenes of this transitory <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of
being and passed on, knowing that his incarnation had been carried

to a triumphant completion. I am glad, indeed, to be able to record
this testimony to the <span class="t23 hoverable">high</span> character and holiness of Sri Yukteswar.
Content to remain afar from the multitude, he gave himself unreservedly
and in tranquillity to that ideal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> which Paramhansa Yogananda,
his disciple, has now described for the ages. W. Y. EVANS-WENTZ

CHAPTER: 1

MY PARENTS AND EARLY <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">LIFE</span>

The characteristic features of Indian culture have <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> been
a search for ultimate verities and the concomitant disciple-guru
{FN1-2} relationship. My own path led me to a Christlike sage <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span>
beautiful <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> was chiseled for the ages. He was one of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>
masters who are India's sole remaining wealth. Emerging in every
generation, they have bulwarked their <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">land</span> against the fate of
Babylon and Egypt.

I <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> my earliest memories covering the anachronistic features of
a previous incarnation. Clear recollections came to me of a distant
life, a yogi {FN1-3} amidst the Himalayan snows. These glimpses of
the past, by some dimensionless link, also afforded me a glimpse
of the future.

The helpless humiliations of infancy are not banished from my mind.
I was resentfully conscious of not being able to walk or express
myself freely. Prayerful surges arose <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> me as I realized
my bodily impotence. My strong emotional <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> silent <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> as
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> in many languages. Among the inward confusion of tongues,
my ear gradually accustomed itself to the circumambient Bengali
syllables of my people. The beguiling scope of an infant's mind!
adultly considered limited to toys and toes.

Psychological ferment and my unresponsive <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> me to many
obstinate crying-spells. I recall the general family bewilderment
at my distress. Happier memories, too, crowd in on me: my mother's
caresses, and my first attempts at lisping phrase and toddling
step. These early triumphs, usually forgotten quickly, are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> a
natural basis of self-confidence.

My far-reaching memories are not unique. Many yogis are known
to have retained their self-consciousness <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> interruption by
the dramatic transition to and from "life" and "death." If <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> be
solely a body, its loss indeed places the final period to identity.
But if prophets down the millenniums spake with truth, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> is
essentially of incorporeal nature. The persistent core of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span>
egoity is only temporarily allied with <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> perception.

Although odd, clear memories of infancy are not extremely rare. During
travels in numerous lands, I have listened to early recollections
from the lips of veracious <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> and women.

I was <span class="t16 t24 hoverable">born</span> in the last decade of the nineteenth century, and passed
my first eight <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> at Gorakhpur. This was my birthplace in the
United Provinces of northeastern India. We were eight children: four
boys and four girls. I, Mukunda Lal Ghosh {FN1-4}, was the <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span>
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> and the fourth child.

Father and Mother were Bengalis, of the KSHATRIYA caste. {FN1-5} Both
were <span class="t11 hoverable">blessed</span> with saintly nature. Their mutual love, tranquil and
dignified, never expressed itself frivolously. A perfect parental
harmony was the calm center for the revolving tumult of eight young
lives.

Father, Bhagabati Charan Ghosh, was kind, grave, at times stern.
Loving him dearly, we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">children</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> observed a certain reverential
distance. An outstanding mathematician and logician, he was guided
principally by his intellect. But Mother was a queen of hearts,
and taught us only through love. After her death, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Father</span> displayed
more of his inner tenderness. I noticed then that his gaze often
metamorphosed into my mother's.

In Mother's presence we tasted our earliest bitter-sweet acquaintance
with the scriptures. Tales from the MAHABHARATA and RAMAYANA {FN1-6}
were resourcefully summoned to meet the exigencies of discipline.
Instruction and chastisement <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> in hand.

A daily gesture of respect to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Father</span> was given by Mother's dressing us
carefully in the afternoons to welcome him home from the office.
His position was similar to that of a vice-president, in the
Bengal-Nagpur Railway, one of India's large companies. His <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span>
involved traveling, and our family lived in several cities during

my childhood.

Mother held an open <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> toward the needy. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Father</span> was also kindly
disposed, but his respect for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">law</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> extended to the budget.
One fortnight Mother spent, in feeding the poor, more than Father's
monthly income.

"All I ask, please, is to keep your charities <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> a reasonable
limit." Even a gentle rebuke from her husband was grievous to Mother.
She ordered a hackney carriage, not hinting to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">children</span> at any
disagreement.

"Good-by; I am going away to my mother's home." Ancient ultimatum!

We broke into astounded lamentations. Our maternal uncle arrived
opportunely; he whispered to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Father</span> some sage counsel, garnered
no doubt from the ages. After <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Father</span> had made a few conciliatory
remarks, Mother happily dismissed the cab. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> ended the only trouble
I ever noticed between my parents. But I recall a characteristic
discussion.

"Please give me ten rupees for a hapless woman who has just arrived
at the house." Mother's smile had its own persuasion.

"Why ten rupees? One is enough." <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Father</span> added a justification: "When

my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">father</span> and grandparents died suddenly, I had my first taste of
poverty. My only breakfast, before walking miles to my school, was
a small banana. Later, at the university, I was in such need that
I applied to a wealthy judge for aid of one rupee per month. He
declined, remarking that even a rupee is important."

"How bitterly you recall the denial of that rupee!" Mother's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span>
had an instant logic. "Do you want this woman also to remember
painfully your refusal of ten rupees which she needs urgently?"

"You win!" With the immemorial gesture of vanquished husbands, he
opened his wallet. "Here is a ten-rupee note. Give it to her with
my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> will."

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Father</span> tended to first say "No" to any new proposal. His attitude
toward the strange woman who so readily enlisted Mother's sympathy
was an example of his customary caution. Aversion to instant
acceptance--typical of the French <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> in the West-is really only
honoring the principle of "due reflection." I always found <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Father</span>
reasonable and evenly balanced in his judgments. If I could bolster
up my numerous requests with one or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> arguments, he invariably
put the coveted goal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> my reach, <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> it were a vacation
trip or a new motorcycle.

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Father</span> was a strict disciplinarian to his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">children</span> in their early

years, but his attitude toward himself was truly Spartan. He
never visited the theater, for instance, but sought his recreation
in various <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> practices and in reading the BHAGAVAD GITA.
{FN1-7} Shunning all luxuries, he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> cling to one old pair of
shoes until they were useless. His <span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t13 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">sons</span> bought automobiles after
they came into popular use, but <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Father</span> was always content with the
trolley car for his daily ride to the office. The accumulation of
money for the sake of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> was alien to his nature. Once, after
organizing the Calcutta Urban Bank, he refused to benefit himself
by holding any of its shares. He had simply wished to perform a
civic duty in his spare time.

Several <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> after <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Father</span> had retired on a pension, an English
accountant arrived to examine the books of the Bengal-Nagpur Railway
Company. The amazed investigator discovered that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Father</span> had never
applied for overdue bonuses.

"He did the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> men!" the accountant told the company.
"He has rupees 125,000 (about $41,250.) owing to him as back
compensation." The officials presented <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Father</span> with a check for
this amount. He <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> so little about it that he overlooked any
mention to the family. Much later he was questioned by my youngest
brother Bishnu, who noticed the large deposit on a bank statement.

"Why be elated by material profit?" <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Father</span> replied. "The one who

pursues a goal of evenmindedness is neither jubilant with gain
nor depressed by loss. He knows that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> arrives penniless in this
world, and departs <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> a single rupee."

[Illustration: MY FATHER, Bhagabati Charan Ghosh, A Disciple of
Lahiri Mahasaya--see father1.jpg]

Early in their married life, my parents became disciples of a
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> master, Lahiri Mahasaya of Benares. This contact strengthened
Father's naturally ascetical temperament. Mother made a remarkable
admission to my eldest sister Roma: "Your <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">father</span> and myself live
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> and wife only once a year, for the purpose of having
children."

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Father</span> first met Lahiri Mahasaya through Abinash Babu, {FN1-8}
an employee in the Gorakhpur office of the Bengal-Nagpur Railway.
Abinash instructed my young ears with engrossing tales of many Indian
saints. He invariably concluded with a tribute to the superior
glories of his own guru.

"Did you ever hear of the extraordinary circumstances under which
your <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">father</span> became a disciple of Lahiri Mahasaya?"

It was on a lazy summer afternoon, as Abinash and I sat <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span>
in the compound of my home, that he put this intriguing question.

I shook my <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> with a smile of anticipation.

"Years ago, before you were born, I asked my superior officer-your
father-to give me a week's leave from my Gorakhpur duties in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span>
to visit my guru in Benares. Your <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">father</span> ridiculed my plan.

"'Are you going to become a religious fanatic?' he inquired.
'Concentrate on your office <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> if you want to forge ahead.'

"Sadly walking home along a woodland path that day, I met your
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">father</span> in a palanquin. He dismissed his servants and conveyance,
and fell into step beside me. Seeking to console me, he pointed
out the advantages of striving for worldly success. But I <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span>
him listlessly. My <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> was repeating: 'Lahiri Mahasaya! I cannot
live <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> seeing you!'

"Our path <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> us to the edge of a tranquil field, where the rays
of the late afternoon <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> were still crowning the tall ripple of
the wild grass. We paused in admiration. There in the field, only
a few yards from us, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> guru suddenly appeared!
{FN1-9}

"'Bhagabati, you are too hard on your employee!' His <span class="t23 hoverable">voice</span> was
resonant in our astounded ears. He vanished as mysteriously as he
had come. On my knees I was exclaiming, 'Lahiri Mahasaya! Lahiri

Mahasaya!' Your <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">father</span> was motionless with stupefaction for a few
moments.

"'Abinash, not only do I give YOU leave, but I give MYSELF leave to
start for Benares tomorrow. I must know this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Lahiri Mahasaya,
who is able to materialize himself at will in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> to intercede
for you! I will <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> my wife and ask this <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> to initiate us in
his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> path. Will you guide us to him?'

"'Of course.' Joy filled me at the miraculous answer to my prayer,
and the quick, favorable turn of events.

"The next evening your parents and I entrained for Benares. We
<span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> a horse cart the following day, and then had to walk through
narrow lanes to my guru's secluded home. Entering his little parlor,
we bowed before the master, enlocked in his habitual lotus posture.
He blinked his piercing <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> and leveled them on your father.

"'Bhagabati, you are too hard on your employee!' His <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> were the
same as those he had <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">days</span> before in the Gorakhpur field.
He added, 'I am glad that you have allowed Abinash to visit me,
and that you and your wife have accompanied him.'

"To their joy, he initiated your parents in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> practice
of KRIYA YOGA. {FN1-10} Your <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">father</span> and I, as brother disciples,

have been close friends since the memorable <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> of the vision.
Lahiri Mahasaya <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> a definite interest in your own birth. Your
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> shall surely be linked with his own: the master's blessing
never fails."

Lahiri Mahasaya <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> shortly after I had entered it.
His picture, in an ornate frame, always graced our family altar in
the various cities to which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Father</span> was transferred by his office.
Many a morning and evening found Mother and me meditating before an
improvised shrine, <span class="t22 t23 t28 hoverable">offering</span> flowers dipped in fragrant sandalwood
paste. With frankincense and myrrh as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as our united devotions,
we honored the divinity which had found <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span> expression in Lahiri
Mahasaya.

His picture had a surpassing influence over my life. As I grew,
the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> of the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> grew with me. In <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> often
see his photographic image emerge from its small frame and, taking
a living form, sit before me. When I attempted to touch the feet
of his luminous body, it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> change and again become the picture.
As childhood slipped into boyhood, I found Lahiri Mahasaya transformed
in my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> from a little image, cribbed in a frame, to a living,
enlightening presence. I frequently prayed to him in moments of
trial or confusion, finding <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> me his solacing direction. At
first I grieved because he was no longer physically living. As I
began to discover his secret omnipresence, I lamented no more. He

had often <span class="t0 t11 t24 hoverable">written</span> to those of his disciples who were over-anxious
to see him: "Why come to <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> my bones and flesh, when I am ever
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> range of your KUTASTHA (spiritual sight)?"

I was <span class="t11 hoverable">blessed</span> about the age of eight with a wonderful healing
through the photograph of Lahiri Mahasaya. This experience gave
intensification to my love. While at our family estate in Ichapur,
Bengal, I was stricken with Asiatic cholera. My <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> was despaired
of; the doctors could do nothing. At my bedside, Mother frantically
motioned me to look at Lahiri Mahasaya's picture on the wall above
my head.

"Bow to him mentally!" She knew I was too feeble even to lift my
<span class="t13 t23 hoverable">hands</span> in salutation. "If you really show your devotion and inwardly
kneel before him, your <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> will be spared!"

I gazed at his photograph and saw there a blinding light, enveloping
my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> and the entire room. My nausea and other uncontrollable
symptoms disappeared; I was well. At once I felt strong enough to
bend over and touch Mother's feet in appreciation of her immeasurable
<span class="t4 t7 t12 t16 hoverable">faith</span> in her guru. Mother pressed her <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> repeatedly against the
little picture.

"O Omnipresent Master, I thank <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thee</span> that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thy</span> <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hath</span> healed my
son!"

I realized that she too had witnessed the luminous blaze through
which I had instantly recovered from a usually fatal disease.

One of my most precious possessions is that same photograph. Given
to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Father</span> by Lahiri Mahasaya himself, it carries a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">holy</span> vibration.
The picture had a miraculous origin. I <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> the story from Father's
brother disciple, Kali Kumar Roy.

It appears that the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> had an aversion to being photographed.
Over his protest, a group picture was once <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> of him and
a cluster of devotees, including Kali Kumar Roy. It was an amazed
photographer who discovered that the plate which had clear images
of all the disciples, revealed nothing more than a blank space in
the center where he had reasonably expected to <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> the outlines
of Lahiri Mahasaya. The phenomenon was widely discussed.

A certain student and expert photographer, Ganga Dhar Babu, boasted
that the fugitive figure <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> not escape him. The next morning,
as the guru sat in lotus posture on a wooden bench with a screen
behind him, Ganga Dhar Babu arrived with his equipment. Taking every
precaution for success, he greedily exposed twelve plates. On each
one he soon found the imprint of the wooden bench and screen, but
once again the master's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> was missing.

With tears and shattered pride, Ganga Dhar Babu sought out his
guru. It was many hours before Lahiri Mahasaya broke his silence
with a pregnant comment:

"I am Spirit. Can your camera reflect the omnipresent Invisible?"

"I see it cannot! But, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Holy</span> Sir, I lovingly <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> a picture of
the bodily temple where alone, to my narrow vision, that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Spirit</span>
appears fully to dwell."

"Come, then, tomorrow morning. I will pose for you."

Again the photographer focused his camera. This <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> the sacred
figure, not cloaked with mysterious imperceptibility, was sharp on
the plate. The <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> never posed for another picture; at least,
I have seen none.

The photograph is reproduced in this book. Lahiri Mahasaya's fair
features, of a universal cast, hardly suggest to what race he
belonged. His intense joy of God-communion is slightly revealed in
a somewhat enigmatic smile. His eyes, half open to denote a nominal
direction on the outer world, are half closed also. Completely
oblivious to the poor lures of the earth, he was fully awake at
all times to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> problems of seekers who approached for
his bounty.

Shortly after my healing through the potency of the guru's picture,
I had an influential <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> vision. Sitting on my bed one morning,
I fell into a deep reverie.

"What is behind the darkness of closed eyes?" This probing <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span>
came powerfully into my mind. An immense flash of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> at once
manifested to my inward gaze. <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> shapes of saints, sitting in
<span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> posture in mountain caves, formed like miniature cinema
pictures on the large screen of radiance <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> my forehead.

"Who are you?" I spoke aloud.

"We are the Himalayan yogis." The celestial response is difficult
to describe; my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> was thrilled.

"Ah, I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> to go to the Himalayas and become like you!" The vision
vanished, but the silvery beams expanded in ever-widening circles
to infinity.

"What is this wondrous glow?"

"I am Iswara.{FN1-11} I am Light." The <span class="t23 hoverable">voice</span> was as murmuring
clouds.

"I want to be one with Thee!"

Out of the slow dwindling of my <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> ecstasy, I salvaged a permanent
legacy of inspiration to seek God. "He is eternal, ever-new Joy!"
This memory persisted <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> after the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> of rapture.

Another early recollection is outstanding; and literally so, for
I bear the scar to this day. My elder sister Uma and I were seated
in the early morning under a NEEM tree in our Gorakhpur compound.
She was helping me with a Bengali primer, what <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> I could spare
my gaze from the near-by parrots eating ripe margosa fruit. Uma
complained of a boil on her leg, and fetched a jar of ointment. I
smeared a bit of the salve on my forearm.

"Why do you <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> medicine on a healthy arm?"

"Well, Sis, I feel I am going to have a boil tomorrow. I am testing
your ointment on the spot where the boil will appear."

"You little liar!"

"Sis, don't <span class="t3 t11 t18 t27 hoverable">call</span> me a liar until you see what happens in the
morning." Indignation filled me.

Uma was unimpressed, and thrice repeated her taunt. An adamant

resolution sounded in my <span class="t23 hoverable">voice</span> as I made slow reply.

"By the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of will in me, I say that tomorrow I shall have
a fairly large boil in this exact <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> on my arm; and YOUR boil
shall swell to twice its present size!"

Morning found me with a stalwart boil on the indicated spot; the
dimensions of Uma's boil had doubled. With a shriek, my sister
rushed to Mother. "Mukunda has become a necromancer!" Gravely,
Mother instructed me never to <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> for doing
harm. I have always remembered her counsel, and followed it.

My boil was surgically treated. A noticeable scar, <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> by
the doctor's incision, is present today. On my right forearm is a
constant reminder of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> in man's sheer word.

Those simple and apparently harmless phrases to Uma, spoken
with deep concentration, had possessed sufficient hidden force to
explode like bombs and produce definite, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> injurious, effects.
I understood, later, that the explosive vibratory <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> in speech
could be wisely directed to <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> one's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> from difficulties, and
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> operate <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> scar or rebuke. {FN1-12}

Our family moved to Lahore in the Punjab. There I acquired a picture
of the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Mother in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of the Goddess Kali. {FN1-13} It

sanctified a small informal shrine on the balcony of our home. An
unequivocal conviction came over me that fulfillment <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> crown any
of my prayers uttered in that sacred spot. Standing there with Uma
one day, I watched <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> kites flying over the roofs of the buildings
on the opposite <span class="t6 hoverable">side</span> of the very narrow lane.

"Why are you so quiet?" Uma pushed me playfully.

"I am just thinking how wonderful it is that <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Mother gives
me whatever I ask."

"I suppose She <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> give you those <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> kites!" My sister laughed
derisively.

"Why not?" I began silent prayers for their possession.

Matches are played in India with kites <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> strings are covered
with glue and ground glass. Each player attempts to sever the string
of his opponent. A freed kite sails over the roofs; there is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>
fun in catching it. Inasmuch as Uma and I were on the balcony, it
seemed impossible that any loosed kite could come into our hands;
its string <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> naturally dangle over the roofs.

The players across the lane began their match. One string was cut;
immediately the kite floated in my direction. It was stationary

for a moment, through sudden abatement of breeze, which sufficed
to firmly entangle the string with a cactus plant on top of the
opposite house. A perfect loop was formed for my seizure. I handed
the prize to Uma.

"It was just an extraordinary accident, and not an answer to your
prayer. If the other kite comes to you, then I shall believe."
Sister's dark <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> conveyed more amazement than her words.

I continued my prayers with a crescendo intensity. A forcible tug
by the other player resulted in the abrupt loss of his kite. It
headed toward me, dancing in the wind. My helpful assistant, the
cactus plant, again secured the kite string in the necessary loop
by which I could grasp it. I presented my <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> trophy to Uma.

"Indeed, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Mother listens to you! This is all too uncanny for
me!" Sister bolted away like a frightened fawn.

CHAPTER: 2

MY MOTHER'S <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">DEATH</span> AND THE MYSTIC AMULET

My mother's greatest <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> was the marriage of my elder brother.
"Ah, when I <span class="t0 t6 t7 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t17 t20 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">behold</span> the face of Ananta's wife, I shall <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heaven</span>
on this earth!" I frequently <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> Mother express in these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span>
her strong Indian sentiment for family continuity.

I was about eleven <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> old at the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of Ananta's betrothal.
Mother was in Calcutta, joyously supervising the wedding preparations.
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Father</span> and I alone remained at our home in Bareilly in northern
India, whence <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Father</span> had been transferred after <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> at Lahore.

I had previously witnessed the splendor of nuptial rites for my
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> elder sisters, Roma and Uma; but for Ananta, as the eldest son,

plans were truly elaborate. Mother was welcoming numerous relatives,
daily arriving in Calcutta from distant homes. She lodged them
comfortably in a large, newly acquired <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> at 50 Amherst Street.
Everything was in readiness-the banquet delicacies, the gay throne
on which Brother was to be carried to the home of the bride-to-be,
the rows of colorful lights, the mammoth cardboard elephants and
camels, the English, Scottish and Indian orchestras, the professional
entertainers, the priests for the ancient rituals.

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Father</span> and I, in gala spirits, were planning to join the family
in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> for the ceremony. Shortly before the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> day, however,
I had an ominous vision.

It was in Bareilly on a midnight. As I slept beside <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Father</span> on the
piazza of our bungalow, I was awakened by a peculiar flutter of
the mosquito netting over the bed. The flimsy curtains parted and
I saw the beloved <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of my mother.

"Awaken your father!" Her <span class="t23 hoverable">voice</span> was only a whisper. "Take the first
available train, at four o'clock this morning. Rush to Calcutta if
you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> see me!" The wraithlike figure vanished.

"Father, Father! Mother is dying!" The terror in my tone aroused
him instantly. I sobbed out the fatal tidings.

"Never <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> that hallucination of yours." <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Father</span> gave his characteristic
negation to a new situation. "Your mother is in excellent health.
If we get any bad news, we shall leave tomorrow."

"You shall never forgive yourself for not starting now!" Anguish
caused me to add bitterly, "Nor shall I ever forgive you!"

The melancholy morning came with explicit words: "Mother dangerously
ill; marriage postponed; come at once."

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Father</span> and I <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> distractedly. One of my uncles met us en route
at a transfer point. A train thundered toward us, looming with
telescopic increase. From my inner tumult, an abrupt determination
arose to hurl myself on the railroad tracks. Already bereft, I
felt, of my mother, I could not endure a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> suddenly barren to
the bone. I loved Mother as my dearest friend on earth. Her solacing
black <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> had been my surest refuge in the trifling tragedies of
childhood.

"Does she <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> live?" I stopped for one last question to my uncle.

"Of course she is alive!" He was not slow to interpret the desperation
in my face. But I scarcely believed him.

When we reached our Calcutta home, it was only to confront the

stunning mystery of death. I collapsed into an almost lifeless
state. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Years</span> passed before any reconciliation entered my heart.
Storming the very gates of heaven, my cries at last summoned the
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Mother. Her <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> final healing to my suppurating
wounds:

"It is I who have watched over thee, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> after life, in the

lost beautiful eyes, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thou</span> seekest!"

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Father</span> and I returned to Bareilly soon after the crematory
rites for the well-beloved. Early every morning I made a pathetic
memorial--pilgrimage to a large SHEOLI tree which shaded the
smooth, green-gold lawn before our bungalow. In poetical moments,
I <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> that the white SHEOLI flowers were strewing themselves
with a willing devotion over the grassy altar. Mingling tears with
the dew, I often observed a strange other-worldly <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> emerging
from the dawn. Intense pangs of longing for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> assailed me. I felt
powerfully drawn to the Himalayas.

One of my cousins, fresh from a period of travel in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">holy</span> hills,
visited us in Bareilly. I listened eagerly to his tales about the
<span class="t23 hoverable">high</span> mountain abode of yogis and swamis. {FN2-1}

"Let us run away to the Himalayas." My suggestion one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> to

Dwarka Prasad, the young <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> of our landlord in Bareilly, fell on
unsympathetic ears. He revealed my plan to my elder brother, who
had just arrived to see Father. Instead of laughing lightly over
this impractical scheme of a small boy, Ananta made it a definite
point to ridicule me.

"Where is your orange robe? You can't be a swami <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> that!"

But I was inexplicably thrilled by his words. They <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> a clear
picture of myself roaming about India as a monk. Perhaps they
awakened memories of a past life; in any case, I began to see with
what natural ease I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> wear the garb of that anciently-founded
monastic order.

Chatting one morning with Dwarka, I felt a <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t8 t13 t15 t17 t18 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> descending
with avalanchic force. My companion was only partly attentive to
the ensuing eloquence, but I was wholeheartedly listening to myself.

I fled that afternoon toward Naini Tal in the Himalayan foothills.
Ananta gave determined chase; I was forced to return sadly to
Bareilly. The only pilgrimage permitted me was the customary one
at dawn to the SHEOLI tree. My <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> wept for the lost Mothers,

The rent <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> in the family fabric by Mother's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">death</span> was irreparable.

Father never remarried during his nearly forty remaining years.
Assuming the difficult role of Father-Mother to his little flock,
he grew noticeably more tender, more approachable. With calmness
and insight, he solved the various family problems. After office
hours he retired like a hermit to the cell of his room, practicing
KRIYA YOGA in a sweet serenity. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Long</span> after Mother's death, I attempted
to engage an English nurse to attend to details that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> make my

[Illustration: My Mother, A Disciple of Lahiri Mahasaya--see
mother.jpg]

"Service to me ended with your mother." His <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> were remote with
a lifelong devotion. "I will not accept ministrations from any
other woman."

Fourteen months after Mother's passing, I learned that she had <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span>
me a momentous message. Ananta was present at her deathbed and had
recorded her words. Although she had asked that the disclosure be
made to me in one year, my brother delayed. He was soon to leave
Bareilly for Calcutta, to marry the girl Mother had chosen for him.
{FN2-2} One evening he summoned me to his side.

"Mukunda, I have been reluctant to give you strange tidings."
Ananta's tone held a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">note</span> of resignation. "My <span class="t28 hoverable">fear</span> was to inflame

your <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> to leave home. But in any <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> you are bristling with

When I captured you recently on your <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> to the
Himalayas, I came to a definite resolve. I must not further postpone
the fulfillment of my solemn promise." My brother handed me a small
box, and delivered Mother's message.

"Let these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> be my final blessing, my beloved <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> Mukunda!"
Mother had said. "The hour is here when I must relate a <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> of
phenomenal events following your birth. I first knew your destined
path when you were but a babe in my arms. I carried you then to
the home of my guru in Benares. Almost hidden behind a throng of
disciples, I could barely see Lahiri Mahasaya as he sat in deep
meditation.

"While I patted you, I was praying that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> guru <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span>
notice and bestow a blessing. As my silent devotional demand grew
in intensity, he opened his <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> and beckoned me to approach. The
others made a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> for me; I bowed at the sacred feet. My <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span>
seated you on his lap, placing his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> on your forehead by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> of
spiritually baptizing you.

omniscient guru. Shortly before your birth, he had told me you

"Later, my son, your vision of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Great</span> <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Light</span> was known to me and
your sister Roma, as from the next room we observed you motionless
on the bed. Your little face was illuminated; your <span class="t23 hoverable">voice</span> rang with
iron resolve as you spoke of going to the Himalayas in quest of
the Divine.

"In these ways, dear son, I came to know that your road lies far
from worldly ambitions. The most singular event in my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span>
further confirmation-an event which now impels my deathbed message.

"It was an interview with a sage in the Punjab. While our family
was living in Lahore, one morning the servant came precipitantly
into my room.

"'Mistress, a strange SADHU {FN2-3} is here. He insists that he
"see the mother of Mukunda."'

"These simple <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> struck a profound chord <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> me; I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> at
once to greet the visitor. Bowing at his feet, I sensed that before
me was a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> of God.

"'Mother,' he said, 'the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> masters wish you to know that your

be your last.' {FN2-4} There was a silence, during which I felt no
alarm but only a vibration of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> peace. Finally he addressed me
again:

"'You are to be the custodian of a certain silver amulet. I will
not give it to you today; to demonstrate the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> in my words, the

On your deathbed, you must instruct your eldest <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> Ananta to keep
the amulet for one year and then to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> it over to your <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span>
son. Mukunda will understand the <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> of the talisman from the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> ones. He should receive it about the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> he is ready to
renounce all worldly hopes and start his vital search for God. When
he has retained the amulet for some years, and when it has served
its purpose, it shall vanish. Even if kept in the most secret spot,
it shall return whence it came.'

"I proffered alms {FN2-5} to the saint, and bowed before him
in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> reverence. Not taking the offering, he departed with a
blessing. The next evening, as I sat with folded <span class="t13 t23 hoverable">hands</span> in meditation,
a silver amulet materialized between my palms, even as the SADHU
had promised. It made itself known by a cold, smooth touch. I
have jealously guarded it for more than <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> years, and now leave
it in Ananta's keeping. Do not grieve for me, as I shall have been
ushered by my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> guru into the arms of the Infinite. Farewell,

my child; the Cosmic Mother will protect you."

A blaze of illumination came over me with possession of the amulet;
many dormant memories awakened. The talisman, round and anciently
quaint, was covered with Sanskrit characters. I understood that it
came from teachers of past lives, who were invisibly guiding my
steps. A further significance there was, indeed; but one does not
reveal fully the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> of an amulet.

How the talisman finally vanished amidst deeply unhappy circumstances
of my life; and how its loss was a herald of my gain of a guru,
cannot be told in this chapter.

But the small boy, thwarted in his attempts to reach the Himalayas,
daily traveled far on the wings of his amulet.

{FN2-1} Sanskrit root <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> of SWAMI is "he who is one with his

My keen <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t8 t13 t15 t17 t18 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> of travel was seldom hindered by Father. He permitted
me, even as a mere boy, to visit many cities and pilgrimage spots.
Usually one or more of my friends accompanied me; we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> travel

as a railroad official was fully satisfactory to the nomads in the

Benares, I proceeded immediately to the swami's residence. The
front door was open; I made my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> to a long, hall-like room on
the <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> floor. A rather stout man, wearing only a loincloth, was
seated in lotus posture on a slightly raised platform. His <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> and
unwrinkled face were clean-shaven; a beatific smile played about
his lips. To dispel my <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> that I had intruded, he greeted me
as an old friend.

"BABA ANAND (bliss to my dear one)." His welcome was given heartily
in a childlike voice. I knelt and touched his feet.

"Are you Swami Pranabananda?"

He nodded. "Are you Bhagabati's son?" His <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> were out before I
had had <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> to get Father's letter from my pocket. In astonishment,
I handed him the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">note</span> of introduction, which now seemed superfluous.

"Of course I will locate Kedar Nath Babu for you." The saint again
surprised me by his clairvoyance. He glanced at the letter, and
made a few affectionate references to my parent.

"You know, I am enjoying <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> pensions. One is by the recommendation
of your father, for whom I once worked in the railroad office. The
other is by the recommendation of my Heavenly Father, for whom I
have conscientiously finished my earthly duties in life."

I found this remark very obscure. "What kind of pension, sir, do
you receive from the Heavenly Father? Does He drop money in your
lap?"

He laughed. "I mean a pension of fathomless peace-a reward for many
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> of deep meditation. I never crave money now. My few material

needs are amply provided for. Later you will understand the
significance of a <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> pension."

Abruptly terminating our conversation, the saint became gravely
motionless. A sphinxlike air enveloped him. At first his <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span>
sparkled, as if observing something of interest, then grew dull. I
felt abashed at his pauciloquy; he had not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> told me how I could
meet Father's friend. A trifle restlessly, I looked about me in
the bare room, empty except for us two. My idle gaze <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> in his
wooden sandals, lying under the platform seat.

"Little sir, {FN3-1} don't get worried. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> you wish to see
will be with you in half an hour." The yogi was reading my mind-a
feat not too difficult at the moment!

Again he fell into inscrutable silence. My watch informed me that
thirty minutes had elapsed.

The swami aroused himself. "I think Kedar Nath Babu is nearing the
door."

I <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> somebody coming up the stairs. An amazed incomprehension
arose suddenly; my thoughts raced in confusion: "How is it possible
that Father's friend has been summoned to this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> the
help of a messenger? The swami has spoken to no one but myself

since my arrival!"

Abruptly I quitted the room and descended the steps. Halfway down
I met a thin, fair-skinned <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> of medium height. He appeared to be
in a hurry.

"Are you Kedar Nath Babu?" Excitement colored my voice.

"Yes. Are you not Bhagabati's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> who has been waiting here to meet
me?" He smiled in friendly fashion.

"Sir, how do you happen to come here?" I felt baffled resentment
over his inexplicable presence.

"Everything is mysterious today! Less than an hour ago I had just
finished my bath in the Ganges when Swami Pranabananda approached
me. I have no idea how he knew I was there at that time.

"'Bhagabati's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> is waiting for you in my apartment,' he said.
'Will you come with me?' I gladly agreed. As we proceeded <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> in
hand, the swami in his wooden sandals was strangely able to outpace
me, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> I wore these stout walking shoes.

"'How <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> will it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> you to reach my place?' Pranabanandaji
suddenly halted to ask me this question.

"'About half an hour.'

"'I have something else to do at present.' He gave me an enigmatical
glance. 'I must leave you behind. You can join me in my house,
where Bhagabati's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> and I will be awaiting you.'

"Before I could remonstrate, he dashed swiftly past me and disappeared
in the crowd. I walked here as fast as possible."

This explanation only increased my bewilderment. I inquired how
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> he had known the swami.

"We met a few times last year, but not recently. I was very glad
to see him again today at the bathing GHAT."

"I cannot believe my ears! Am I losing my mind? Did you meet him
in a vision, or did you actually see him, touch his hand, and hear
the sound of his feet?"

"I don't know what you're driving at!" He flushed angrily. "I am
not lying to you. Can't you understand that only through the swami
could I have known you were waiting at this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> for me?"

"Why, that man, Swami Pranabananda, has not <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> my sight a moment

since I first came about an hour ago." I blurted out the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span>
story.

His <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> opened widely. "Are we living in this material age, or
are we dreaming? I never expected to witness such a miracle in my
life! I <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> this swami was just an ordinary man, and now I <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span>
he can materialize an extra <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> through it!" <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Together</span> we
entered the saint's room.

"Look, those are the very sandals he was wearing at the GHAT,"
Kedar Nath Babu whispered. "He was clad only in a loincloth, just
as I see him now."

As the visitor bowed before him, the saint turned to me with a
quizzical smile.

"Why are you stupefied at all this? The subtle unity of the phenomenal
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> is not hidden from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> yogis. I instantly see and converse
with my disciples in distant Calcutta. They can similarly transcend
at will every obstacle of gross matter."

It was probably in an effort to stir <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> ardor in my young
breast that the swami had condescended to tell me of his powers of
astral radio and television. {FN3-2} But instead of enthusiasm, I
experienced only an awe-stricken fear. Inasmuch as I was destined

to undertake my <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> search through one particular guru-Sri
Yukteswar, whom I had not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> met-I felt no inclination to accept
Pranabananda as my teacher. I glanced at him doubtfully, wondering
if it were he or his counterpart before me.

[Illustration: Swami Pranabananda, "The Saint With <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Two</span> Bodies", An
Exalted Disciple of Lahiri Mahasaya--see pranabananda.jpg]

The <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> sought to banish my disquietude by bestowing a soul-awakening
gaze, and by some inspiring <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> about his guru.

"Lahiri Mahasaya was the greatest yogi I ever knew. He was Divinity
Itself in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of flesh."

If a disciple, I reflected, could materialize an extra fleshly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span>
at will, what miracles indeed could be barred to his master?

"I will tell you how priceless is a guru's help. I <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> to meditate
with another disciple for eight hours every night. We had to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> at
the railroad office during the day. Finding difficulty in carrying
on my clerical duties, I desired to devote my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> to God.
For eight <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> I persevered, meditating half the night. I had
wonderful results; tremendous <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> perceptions illumined my
mind. But a little veil always remained between me and the Infinite.
Even with super-human earnestness, I found the final irrevocable

union to be denied me. One evening I paid a visit to Lahiri Mahasaya
and pleaded for his <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> intercession. My importunities continued
during the entire night.

"'Angelic Guru, my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> anguish is such that I can no longer

"'What can I do? You must meditate more profoundly.'

"'I am appealing to Thee, O <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> my Master!

go now and meditate. I have interceded for you with Brahma.' {FN3-3}

"Immeasurably uplifted, I returned to my home. In <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> that
night, the burning Goal of my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> was achieved. Now I ceaselessly
enjoy the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> pension.

Creator remained hidden from my <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> behind any screen of delusion."

Pranabananda's face was suffused with <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> light. The <span class="t13 hoverable">peace</span> of

a further confidence.

"Some months later I returned to Lahiri Mahasaya and tried to
thank him for his bestowal of the infinite gift. Then I mentioned
another matter.

"'Divine Guru, I can no longer <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> in the office. Please release
me. Brahma keeps me continuously intoxicated.'

"'Apply for a pension from your company.'

"'What <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> shall I give, so early in my service?'

"'Say what you feel.'

"The next <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> I made my application. The doctor inquired the grounds
for my premature request.

"'At work, I <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> an overpowering sensation rising in my spine.

"Without further questioning the physician recommended me highly
for a pension, which I soon received. I know the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> will of

After this extraordinary revelation, Swami Pranabananda retired
into one of his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> silences. As I was taking leave, touching his
feet reverently, he gave me his blessing:

"Your <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> belongs to the path of renunciation and yoga. I shall
see you again, with your father, later on." The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span>
fulfillment to both these predictions. {FN3-6}

Kedar Nath Babu walked by my <span class="t6 hoverable">side</span> in the gathering darkness. I
delivered Father's letter, which my companion read under a street
lamp.

"Your <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">father</span> suggests that I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> a position in the Calcutta office
of his railroad company. How pleasant to look forward to at least
one of the pensions that Swami Pranabananda enjoys! But it is
impossible; I cannot leave Benares.

{FN3-1} CHOTO MAHASAYA is the term by which a <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> of Indian
saints addressed me. It translates "little sir.".

{FN3-2} In its own way, <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> science is affirming the validity
of laws discovered by yogis through mental science. For example,

persons and objects on the opposite <span class="t6 hoverable">side</span> of a wall. Dr. Calligaris
told the other professors that if certain areas on the skin are
agitated, the subject is given super-sensorial impressions enabling
him to see objects that he could not otherwise perceive. To enable
his subject to discern <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> on the other <span class="t6 hoverable">side</span> of a wall, Professor
Calligaris pressed on a spot to the right of the thorax for fifteen

not feel any perplexity."

CHAPTER: 4

MY INTERRUPTED FLIGHT TOWARD THE HIMALAYAS

"Leave your classroom on some trifling pretext, and engage a hackney
carriage. Stop in the lane where no one in my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> can see you."

These were my final instructions to Amar Mitter, a <span class="t23 hoverable">high</span> school
friend who planned to accompany me to the Himalayas. We had chosen
the following <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> for our flight. Precautions were necessary,
as Ananta exercised a vigilant eye. He was determined to foil the
plans of escape which he suspected were uppermost in my mind. The
amulet, like a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> yeast, was silently at <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> me.
Amidst the Himalayan snows, I hoped to <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> face
often appeared to me in visions.

The family was living now in Calcutta, where <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Father</span> had been
permanently transferred. Following the patriarchal Indian custom,

Ananta had <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> his bride to live in our home, now at 4 Gurpar
Road. There in a small attic room I engaged in daily meditations
and prepared my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> for the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> search.

The memorable morning arrived with inauspicious rain. Hearing the
wheels of Amar's carriage in the road, I hastily tied <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> a
blanket, a pair of sandals, Lahiri Mahasaya's picture, a copy of
the BHAGAVAD GITA, a string of prayer beads, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> loincloths.
This bundle I threw from my third-story window. I ran down the
steps and passed my uncle, buying fish at the door.

"What is the excitement?" His gaze roved suspiciously over my
person.

I gave him a noncommittal smile and walked to the lane. Retrieving
my bundle, I joined Amar with conspiratorial caution. We drove to
Chadni Chowk, a merchandise center. For months we had been saving
our tiffin money to buy English clothes. Knowing that my clever
brother could easily play the part of a detective, we <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> to
outwit him by European garb.

On the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> to the station, we stopped for my cousin, Jotin Ghosh,
whom I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Jatinda. He was a new convert, longing for a guru
in the Himalayas. He donned the new suit we had in readiness.
Well-camouflaged, we hoped! A deep elation possessed our hearts.

"All we need now are canvas shoes." I led my companions to a shop
displaying rubber-soled footwear. "Articles of leather, gotten
only through the slaughter of animals, must be absent on this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">holy</span>
trip." I halted on the street to remove the leather cover from my
BHAGAVAD GITA, and the leather straps from my English-made SOLA
TOPEE (helmet).

At the station we bought tickets to Burdwan, where we planned to
transfer for Hardwar in the Himalayan foothills. As soon as the
train, like ourselves, was in flight, I gave utterance to a few of
my glorious anticipations.

"Just imagine!" I ejaculated. "We shall be initiated by the masters
and experience the trance of cosmic consciousness. Our <span class="t21 hoverable">flesh</span> will
be charged with such magnetism that wild animals of the Himalayas
will come tamely near us. Tigers will be no more than meek <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span>
cats awaiting our caresses!"

This remark-picturing a prospect I considered entrancing, both
metaphorically and literally-brought an enthusiastic smile from
Amar. But Jatinda averted his gaze, directing it through the window
at the scampering landscape.

"Let the money be divided in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> portions." Jatinda broke a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span>

silence with this suggestion. "Each of us should buy his own ticket
at Burdwan. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> no one at the station will surmise that we are
running away together."

I unsuspectingly agreed. At dusk our train stopped at Burdwan.
Jatinda entered the ticket office; Amar and I sat on the platform.
We waited fifteen minutes, then made unavailing inquiries. Searching
in all directions, we shouted Jatinda's name with the urgency
of fright. But he had faded into the dark unknown surrounding the
little station.

I was completely unnerved, shocked to a peculiar numbness. That <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span>
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> countenance this depressing episode! The romantic occasion
of my first carefully-planned flight after Him was cruelly marred.

"Amar, we must return home." I was weeping like a child. "Jatinda's
callous departure is an ill omen. This trip is doomed to failure."

"Is this your <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t8 t13 t15 t17 t18 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> for the Lord? Can't you stand the little test
of a treacherous companion?"

Through Amar's suggestion of a <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> test, my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> steadied
itself. We refreshed ourselves with famous Burdwan sweetmeats,
SITABHOG (food for the goddess) and MOTICHUR (nuggets of sweet
pearl). In a few hours, we entrained for Hardwar, via Bareilly.

Changing trains at Moghul Serai, we discussed a vital <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> as we
waited on the platform.

"Amar, we may soon be closely questioned by railroad officials.
I am not underrating my brother's ingenuity! No <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> what the
outcome, I will not <span class="t9 t11 t20 t21 t22 t23 t27 hoverable">speak</span> untruth."

"All I ask of you, Mukunda, is to keep still. Don't laugh or grin
while I am talking."

At this moment, a European station agent accosted me. He waved a
telegram <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> import I immediately grasped.

"Are you running away from home in anger?"

"No!" I was glad his choice of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> permitted me to make emphatic
reply. Not anger but "divinest melancholy" was responsible, I knew,
for my unconventional behavior.

The official then turned to Amar. The duel of wits that followed
hardly permitted me to maintain the counseled stoic gravity.

"Where is the <span class="t7 hoverable">third</span> boy?" The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> injected a <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span> ring of authority
into his voice. "Come on; <span class="t9 t11 t20 t21 t22 t23 t27 hoverable">speak</span> the truth!"

"Sir, I notice you are wearing eyeglasses. Can't you see that
we are only two?" Amar smiled impudently. "I am not a magician; I
can't conjure up a <span class="t7 hoverable">third</span> companion."

The official, noticeably disconcerted by this impertinence, sought
a new field of attack.

"What is your name?"

"I am <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Thomas. I am the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> of an English mother and a
converted Christian Indian father."

"What is your friend's name?"

"I <span class="t3 t11 t18 t27 hoverable">call</span> him Thompson."

By this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> my inward mirth had reached a zenith; I unceremoniously
made for the train, whistling for departure. Amar followed with
the official, who was credulous and obliging enough to put us into
a European compartment. It evidently pained him to think of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span>
half-English boys traveling in the section allotted to natives. After
his polite exit, I lay back on the seat and laughed uncontrollably.
My friend wore an expression of blithe satisfaction at having
outwitted a veteran European official.

On the platform I had contrived to read the telegram. From my brother,
it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> thus: "Three Bengali boys in English clothes running away
from home toward Hardwar via Moghul Serai. Please detain them until
my arrival. Ample reward for your services."

"Amar, I told you not to leave marked timetables in your home." My
glance was reproachful. "Brother must have found one there."

My friend sheepishly acknowledged the thrust. We halted briefly
in Bareilly, where Dwarka Prasad awaited us with a telegram from
Ananta. My old friend tried valiantly to detain us; I convinced him
that our flight had not been undertaken lightly. As on a previous
occasion, Dwarka refused my invitation to <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> forth to the Himalayas.

While our train stood in a station that night, and I was half asleep,
Amar was awakened by another questioning official. He, too, fell a
victim to the hybrid charms of "Thomas" and "Thompson." The train
bore us triumphantly into a dawn arrival at Hardwar. The majestic
mountains loomed invitingly in the distance. We dashed through the
station and entered the freedom of <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">city</span> crowds. Our first act was
to change into native costume, as Ananta had somehow penetrated
our European disguise. A premonition of capture weighed on my mind.

Deeming it advisable to leave Hardwar at once, we bought tickets to
proceed north to Rishikesh, a soil <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> hallowed by feet of many

masters. I had already boarded the train, while Amar lagged on
the platform. He was <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> to an abrupt halt by a shout from a
policeman. Our unwelcome guardian escorted us to a station bungalow
and <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> charge of our money. He explained courteously that it was
his duty to hold us until my elder brother arrived.

Learning that the truants' destination had been the Himalayas, the
officer related a strange story.

"I see you are crazy about saints! You will never meet a greater
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> than the one I saw only yesterday. My brother officer
and I first encountered him five <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">days</span> ago. We were patrolling by the
Ganges, on a sharp lookout for a certain murderer. Our instructions
were to capture him, alive or dead. He was known to be masquerading
as a SADHU in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> to rob pilgrims. A short <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> before us, we
spied a figure which resembled the description of the criminal. He
ignored our command to stop; we ran to overpower him. Approaching
his back, I wielded my ax with tremendous force; the man's right
arm was severed almost completely from his body.

"Without outcry or any glance at the ghastly wound, the stranger
astonishingly continued his swift pace. As we jumped in front of
him, he spoke quietly.

"'I am not the murderer you are seeking.'

"I was deeply mortified to see I had injured the <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> of a
divine--looking sage. Prostrating myself at his feet, I implored
his pardon, and offered my turban-cloth to staunch the heavy spurts
of blood.

"'Son, that was just an understandable mistake on your part.' The
saint regarded me kindly. 'Run along, and don't reproach yourself.
The Beloved Mother is taking care of me.' He pushed his dangling
arm into its stump and lo! it adhered; the blood inexplicably ceased
to flow.

"'Come to me under yonder tree in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">days</span> and you will <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> me
fully healed. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> you will feel no remorse.'

"Yesterday my brother officer and I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> eagerly to the designated
spot. The SADHU was there and allowed us to examine his arm. It
bore no scar or trace of hurt!

"'I am going via Rishikesh to the Himalayan solitudes.' He <span class="t11 hoverable">blessed</span>
us as he departed quickly. I feel that my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> has been uplifted
through his sanctity."

The officer concluded with a pious ejaculation; his experience had
obviously moved him beyond his usual depths. With an impressive

gesture, he handed me a printed clipping about the miracle. In
the usual garbled manner of the sensational type of newspaper (not
missing, alas! even in India), the reporter's version was slightly
exaggerated: it indicated that the SADHU had been almost decapitated!

Amar and I lamented that we had missed the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> yogi who could
forgive his persecutor in such a Christlike way. India, materially
poor for the last <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> centuries, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> has an inexhaustible fund of
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> wealth; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> "skyscrapers" may occasionally be encountered
by the wayside, even by worldly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> like this policeman.

We thanked the officer for relieving our tedium with his marvelous
story. He was probably intimating that he was more fortunate than
we: he had met an illumined saint <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> effort; our earnest search
had ended, not at the feet of a master, but in a coarse police
station!

So near the Himalayas and yet, in our captivity, so far, I told
Amar I felt doubly impelled to seek freedom.

"Let us slip away when opportunity offers. We can go on foot to
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">holy</span> Rishikesh." I smiled encouragingly.

But my companion had turned pessimist as soon as the stalwart prop
of our money had been <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> from us.

"If we started a trek over such dangerous jungle land, we should
finish, not in the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">city</span> of saints, but in the stomachs of tigers!"

Ananta and Amar's brother arrived after <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> days. Amar greeted
his relative with affectionate relief. I was unreconciled; Ananta
got no more from me than a severe upbraiding.

"I understand how you feel." My brother spoke soothingly. "All I
ask of you is to accompany me to Benares to meet a certain saint,
and go on to Calcutta to visit your grieving <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">father</span> for a few days.
Then you can resume your search here for a master."

Amar entered the conversation at this point to disclaim any intention
of returning to Hardwar with me. He was enjoying the familial
warmth. But I knew I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> never abandon the quest for my guru.

Our party entrained for Benares. There I had a singular and instant
response to my prayers.

A clever scheme had been prearranged by Ananta. Before seeing me
at Hardwar, he had stopped in Benares to ask a certain scriptural
authority to interview me later. Both the pundit and his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> had
promised to undertake my dissuasion from the path of a SANNYASI.
{FN4-1}

Ananta <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> me to their home. The son, a young <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> of ebullient
manner, greeted me in the courtyard. He engaged me in a lengthy
philosophic discourse. Professing to have a clairvoyant <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span>
of my future, he discountenanced my idea of being a monk.

"You will meet continual misfortune, and be unable to <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> God, if
you insist on deserting your ordinary responsibilities! You cannot
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> out your past karma {FN4-2} <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> worldly experiences."

Krishna's immortal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> rose to my lips in reply: "'Even he with
the worst of karma who ceaselessly meditates on Me quickly loses
the effects of his past bad actions. Becoming a high-souled being,
he soon attains perennial peace. Arjuna, know this for certain:
the devotee who puts his trust in Me never perishes!'" {FN4-3}

But the forceful prognostications of the young <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> had slightly
shaken my confidence. With all the fervor of my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> I prayed
silently to God:

"Please solve my bewilderment and answer me, right here and now, if
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thou</span> dost <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> me to lead the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of a renunciate or a worldly
man!"

I noticed a SADHU of noble countenance standing just outside

the compound of the pundit's house. Evidently he had overheard
the spirited conversation between the self-styled clairvoyant and
myself, for the stranger <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> me to his side. I felt a tremendous
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> flowing from his calm eyes.

"Son, don't listen to that ignoramus. In response to your prayer,
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> tells me to assure you that your sole path in this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span>
is that of the renunciate."

With astonishment as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as gratitude, I smiled happily at this
decisive message.

"Come away from that man!" The "ignoramus" was calling me from the
courtyard. My saintly guide raised his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> in blessing and slowly
departed.

"That SADHU is just as crazy as you are." It was the hoary-headed
pundit who made this charming observation. He and his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> were
gazing at me lugubriously. "I <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> that he too has <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> his home
in a vague search for God."

I turned away. To Ananta I remarked that I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> not engage in
further discussion with our hosts. My brother agreed to an immediate
departure; we soon entrained for Calcutta.

"Mr. Detective, how did you discover I had fled with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> companions?"
I vented my lively curiosity to Ananta during our homeward journey.
He smiled mischievously.

"At your school, I found that Amar had <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> his classroom and had
not returned. I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> to his home the next morning and unearthed a
marked timetable. Amar's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">father</span> was just leaving by carriage and
was talking to the coachman.

"'My <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> will not ride with me to his school this morning. He has
disappeared!' the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">father</span> moaned.

"'I <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> from a brother coachman that your <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> others,
dressed in European suits, boarded the train at Howrah Station,'
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> stated. 'They made a present of their leather shoes to the
cab driver.'

"Thus I had <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> clues-the timetable, the trio of boys, and the
English clothing."

I was listening to Ananta's disclosures with mingled mirth and
vexation. Our generosity to the coachman had been slightly misplaced!

"Of course I rushed to send telegrams to station officials in all
the cities which Amar had underlined in the timetable. He had checked
Bareilly, so I wired your friend Dwarka there. After inquiries
in our Calcutta neighborhood, I learned that cousin Jatinda had
been absent one night but had arrived home the following morning
in European garb. I sought him out and invited him to dinner. He
accepted, quite disarmed by my friendly manner. On the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> I led him
unsuspectingly to a police station. He was surrounded by several
officers whom I had previously selected for their ferocious
appearance. Under their formidable gaze, Jatinda agreed to <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span>
for his mysterious conduct.

"'I started for the Himalayas in a buoyant <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> mood,' he
explained. 'Inspiration filled me at the prospect of meeting the
masters. But as soon as Mukunda said, "During our ecstasies in the
Himalayan caves, tigers will be spellbound and sit around us like
tame pussies," my spirits froze; beads of perspiration formed on
my brow. "What then?" I thought. "If the vicious <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of the
tigers be not changed through the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of our <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> trance,

shall they treat us with the kindness of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> cats?" In my mind's
eye, I already saw myself the compulsory inmate of some tiger's
stomach-entering there not at once with the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> body, but by
installments of its several parts!'"

My anger at Jatinda's vanishment was evaporated in laughter. The
hilarious sequel on the train was worth all the anguish he had
caused me. I must confess to a slight feeling of satisfaction:
Jatinda too had not escaped an encounter with the police!

"Ananta, {FN4-4} you are a <span class="t16 t24 hoverable">born</span> sleuthhound!" My glance of amusement
was not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> some exasperation. "And I shall tell Jatinda I am
glad he was prompted by no mood of treachery, as it appeared, but
only by the prudent instinct of self-preservation!"

At home in Calcutta, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Father</span> touchingly requested me to curb my roving
feet until, at least, the completion of my <span class="t23 hoverable">high</span> school studies.
In my absence, he had lovingly hatched a plot by arranging for
a saintly pundit, Swami Kebalananda, {FN4-5} to come regularly to
the house.

"The sage will be your Sanskrit tutor," my parent announced
confidently.

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Father</span> hoped to satisfy my religious yearnings by instructions

from a learned philosopher. But the tables were subtly turned: my
new teacher, far from <span class="t22 t23 t28 hoverable">offering</span> intellectual aridities, fanned the
embers of my God-aspiration. Unknown to Father, Swami Kebalananda
was an exalted disciple of Lahiri Mahasaya. The peerless guru had
possessed thousands of disciples, silently drawn to him by the
irresistibility of his <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> magnetism. I learned later that Lahiri
Mahasaya had often characterized Kebalananda as RISHI or illumined
sage.

Luxuriant curls framed my tutor's handsome face. His dark <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> were
guileless, with the transparency of a child's. All the movements of
his slight <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> were marked by a restful deliberation. Ever gentle
and loving, he was firmly established in the infinite consciousness.
Many of our happy hours <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> were spent in deep KRIYA meditation.

Kebalananda was a noted authority on the ancient SHASTRAS or sacred
books: his erudition had earned him the title of "Shastri Mahasaya,"
by which he was usually addressed. But my progress in Sanskrit
scholarship was unnoteworthy. I sought every opportunity to forsake
prosaic grammar and to talk of yoga and Lahiri Mahasaya. My tutor
obliged me one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> by telling me something of his own <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> with
the master.

"Rarely fortunate, I was able to remain near Lahiri Mahasaya for
ten years. His Benares home was my nightly goal of pilgrimage. The

guru was always present in a small front parlor on the first floor.
As he sat in lotus posture on a backless wooden seat, his disciples
garlanded him in a semicircle. His <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> sparkled and danced with
the joy of the Divine. They were ever half closed, peering through
the inner telescopic orb into a sphere of <span class="t20 hoverable">eternal</span> bliss. He seldom
spoke at length. Occasionally his gaze <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> focus on a student in
need of help; healing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> poured then like an avalanche of light.

"An indescribable <span class="t13 hoverable">peace</span> blossomed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> me at the master's glance.
I was permeated with his fragrance, as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> from a lotus of
infinity. To be with him, even <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> exchanging a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> for days,
was experience which changed my entire being. If any invisible
barrier rose in the path of my concentration, I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> meditate at
the guru's feet. There the most tenuous states came easily <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span>
my grasp. Such perceptions eluded me in the presence of lesser
teachers. The <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> was a living temple of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> secret doors
were open to all disciples through devotion.

"Lahiri Mahasaya was no bookish interpreter of the scriptures.
Effortlessly he dipped into the 'divine library.' Foam of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> and
spray of thoughts gushed from the fountain of his omniscience. He
had the wondrous clavis which unlocked the profound philosophical
science embedded ages ago in the VEDAS. {FN4-6} If asked to explain
the different planes of <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> mentioned in the ancient
texts, he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> smilingly assent.

"'I will undergo those states, and presently tell you what I
perceive.' He was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> diametrically unlike the teachers who commit
scripture to memory and then give forth unrealized abstractions.

"'Please expound the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">holy</span> stanzas as the <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> occurs to you.'
The taciturn guru often gave this instruction to a near-by disciple.
'I will guide your thoughts, that the right interpretation be
uttered.' In this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> many of Lahiri Mahasaya's perceptions came
to be recorded, with voluminous commentaries by various students.

"The <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> never counseled slavish belief. 'Words are only shells,'
he said. 'Win conviction of God's presence through your own joyous
contact in meditation.'

"No <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> what the disciple's problem, the guru advised KRIYA YOGA
for its solution.

"'The yogic key will not lose its efficiency when I am no longer
present in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> to guide you. This technique cannot be bound,
filed, and forgotten, in the manner of theoretical inspirations.
Continue ceaselessly on your path to liberation through KRIYA,

"I myself consider KRIYA the most effective device of salvation through

self-effort ever to be evolved in man's search for the Infinite."
Kebalananda concluded with this earnest testimony. "Through its use,
the omnipotent God, hidden in all men, became visibly incarnated
in the <span class="t21 hoverable">flesh</span> of Lahiri Mahasaya and a <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> of his disciples."

A Christlike miracle by Lahiri Mahasaya <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> in Kebalananda's
presence. My saintly tutor recounted the story one day, his <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span>
remote from the Sanskrit <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> before us.

"A blind disciple, Ramu, aroused my active pity. Should he have no
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> in his eyes, when he faithfully served our master, in whom
the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> was fully blazing? One morning I sought to <span class="t9 t11 t20 t21 t22 t23 t27 hoverable">speak</span> to
Ramu, but he sat for patient hours fanning the guru with a hand-made
palm-leaf PUNKHA. When the devotee finally <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> the room, I followed
him.

"'Ramu, how <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> have you been blind?'

"'From my birth, sir! Never have my <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> been <span class="t11 hoverable">blessed</span> with a glimpse
of the sun.'

"'Our omnipotent guru can help you. Please make a supplication.'

"The following <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> Ramu diffidently approached Lahiri Mahasaya. The
disciple felt almost ashamed to ask that <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> wealth be added

to his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> superabundance.

"'Master, the Illuminator of the cosmos is in you. I pray you
to <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> His <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> into my eyes, that I perceive the sun's lesser
glow.'

"'Ramu, someone has connived to put me in a difficult position. I
have no healing power.'

"'Sir, the Infinite One <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> you can certainly heal.'

"'That is indeed different, Ramu. God's limit is nowhere! He who
ignites the stars and the cells of <span class="t21 hoverable">flesh</span> with mysterious life-effulgence
can surely <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> luster of vision into your eyes.'

"The <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> touched Ramu's forehead at the point between the eyebrows.
{FN4-7} "'Keep your <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> concentrated there, and frequently chant
the name of the prophet Rama {FN4-8} for seven days. The splendor
of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> shall have a special dawn for you.'

"Lo! in one week it was so. For the first time, Ramu beheld the
fair face of nature. The Omniscient One had unerringly directed his
disciple to repeat the name of Rama, adored by him above all other
saints. Ramu's <span class="t4 t7 t12 t16 hoverable">faith</span> was the devotionally ploughed soil in which
the guru's powerful seed of permanent healing sprouted." Kebalananda

was silent for a moment, then paid a further tribute to his guru.

"It was evident in all miracles performed by Lahiri Mahasaya that
he never allowed the ego-principle {FN4-9} to consider itself a
causative force. By perfection of resistless surrender, the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span>
enabled the Prime Healing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Power</span> to flow freely through him.

"The numerous bodies which were spectacularly healed through Lahiri
Mahasaya eventually had to feed the flames of cremation. But the
silent <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> awakenings he effected, the Christlike disciples
he fashioned, are his imperishable miracles."

I never became a Sanskrit scholar; Kebalananda taught me a diviner
syntax.

{FN4-1} Literally, "renunciate." From Sanskrit verb roots, "to cast
aside."

{FN4-2} Effects of past actions, in this or a former life; from
Sanskrit KRI, "to do."

of India; Arjuna was his foremost disciple.

To avoid
confusion with the name of Lahiri Mahasaya and of <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> Mahasaya
(../chapter 9), I am referring to my Sanskrit tutor only by his
later monastic name of Swami Kebalananda. His biography has been
recently published in Bengali. <span class="t16 t24 hoverable">Born</span> in the Khulna district of
Bengal in 1863, Kebalananda gave up his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> in Benares at the age
of sixty-eight. His family name was Ashutosh Chatterji.

{FN4-6} The ancient four VEDAS comprise over 100 extant canonical
books. Emerson paid the following tribute in his JOURNAL to Vedic
thought: "It is sublime as heat and night and a breathless ocean.
It contains every religious sentiment, all the grand ethics which
visit in turn each noble poetic mind. . . . It is of no <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> to put

This is her creed. Peace, she <span class="t0 t6 t12 t13 t14 t15 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">saith</span> to me, and purity and absolute
abandonment--these panaceas expiate all <span class="t0 t9 t11 t14 t17 t28 hoverable">sin</span> and <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> you to the

{FN4-8} The central sacred figure of the Sanskrit epic, RAMAYANA.

{FN4-9} Ahankara, egoism; literally, "I do." The root cause of
dualism or illusion of MAYA, whereby the subject (ego) appears as

CHAPTER: 5

A "PERFUME SAINT" DISPLAYS HIS WONDERS

"To every <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> there is a season, and a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> to every purpose
under the heaven."

I did not have this <span class="t12 t20 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">wisdom</span> of Solomon to comfort me; I gazed
searchingly about me, on any excursion from home, for the face of
my destined guru. But my path did not cross his own until after
the completion of my <span class="t23 hoverable">high</span> school studies.

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Two</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> elapsed between my flight with Amar toward the Himalayas,
and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> of Sri Yukteswar's arrival into my life. During

that interim I met a <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> of sages-the "Perfume Saint," the "Tiger
Swami," Nagendra Nath Bhaduri, <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> Mahasaya, and the famous
Bengali scientist, Jagadis Chandra Bose.

My encounter with the "Perfume Saint" had <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> preambles, one
harmonious and the other humorous.

"God is simple. Everything else is complex. Do not seek absolute
values in the relative <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> of nature."

These philosophical finalities gently entered my ear as I stood
silently before a temple image of Kali. Turning, I confronted a
tall <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> garb, or lack of it, revealed him a wandering SADHU.

"You have indeed penetrated the bewilderment of my thoughts!" I
smiled gratefully. "The confusion of benign and terrible aspects
in nature, as symbolized by Kali, {FN5-1} has puzzled wiser heads
than mine!"

"Few there be who solve her mystery! <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Good</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> is the challenging
riddle which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> places sphinxlike before every intelligence.
Attempting no solution, most <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> pay forfeit with their lives,
penalty now even as in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">days</span> of Thebes. Here and there, a towering
lonely figure never cries defeat. From the MAYA {FN5-2} of duality
he plucks the cleaveless <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> of unity."

"You <span class="t9 t11 t20 t21 t22 t23 t27 hoverable">speak</span> with conviction, sir."

"I have <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> exercised an honest introspection, the exquisitely
painful approach to wisdom. Self-scrutiny, relentless observance of
one's thoughts, is a stark and shattering experience. It pulverizes
the stoutest ego. But <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> self-analysis mathematically operates
to produce seers. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> of 'self-expression,' individual

"Truth humbly retires, no doubt, before such arrogant originality."
I was enjoying the discussion.

"Man can understand no <span class="t20 hoverable">eternal</span> verity until he has freed himself
from pretensions. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> mind, bared to a centuried slime, is
teeming with repulsive <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of countless world-delusions. Struggles
of the battlefields pale into insignificance here, when <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> first
contends with inward enemies! No mortal foes these, to be overcome
by harrowing array of might! Omnipresent, unresting, pursuing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span>
even in sleep, subtly equipped with a miasmic weapon, these soldiers
of ignorant lusts seek to slay us all. Thoughtless is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> who
buries his ideals, surrendering to the common fate. Can he seem
other than impotent, wooden, ignominious?"

"Respected Sir, have you no sympathy for the bewildered masses?"

The sage was silent for a moment, then answered obliquely.

"To <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t8 t13 t15 t17 t18 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> both the invisible God, Repository of All Virtues, and
visible man, apparently possessed of none, is often baffling! But
ingenuity is equal to the maze. Inner research soon exposes a unity
in all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> minds-the stalwart kinship of selfish motive. In one
<span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> at least, the brotherhood of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> stands revealed. An aghast
humility follows this leveling discovery. It ripens into compassion
for one's fellows, blind to the healing potencies of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span>
awaiting exploration."

"The saints of every age, sir, have felt like yourself for the
sorrows of the world."

"Only the shallow <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> loses responsiveness to the woes of others'
lives, as he sinks into narrow suffering of his own." The SADHU'S
austere face was noticeably softened. "The one who practices a
scalpel self-dissection will know an expansion of universal pity.
Release is given him from the deafening demands of his ego. The
<span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t8 t13 t15 t17 t18 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> flowers on such soil. The creature finally turns to
his Creator, if for no other <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> than to ask in anguish: 'Why,
Lord, why?' By ignoble whips of pain, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> is driven at last into
the Infinite Presence, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> beauty alone should lure him."

The sage and I were present in Calcutta's Kalighat Temple, whither
I had gone to <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> its famed magnificence. With a sweeping gesture,
my chance companion dismissed the ornate dignity.

"Bricks and mortar sing us no audible tune; the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> opens only
to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> chant of being."

We strolled to the inviting sunshine at the entrance, where throngs
of devotees were passing to and fro.

"You are young." The sage surveyed me thoughtfully. "India too is
young. The ancient RISHIS {FN5-3} laid down ineradicable patterns
of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> living. Their hoary dictums suffice for this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span>
and land. Not outmoded, not unsophisticated against the guiles
of materialism, the disciplinary precepts mold India still. By
millenniums-more than embarrassed scholars care to compute!-the
skeptic <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Time</span> has validated Vedic worth. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Take</span> it for your heritage."

As I was reverently bidding farewell to the eloquent SADHU, he
revealed a clairvoyant perception:

"After you leave here today, an unusual experience will come your
way."

I quitted the temple precincts and wandered along aimlessly. Turning
a corner, I ran into an old acquaintance-one of those long-winded
fellows <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> conversational powers ignore <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> and embrace eternity.

"I will let you go in a very short while, if you will tell me all
that has happened during the six <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> of our separation."

"What a paradox! I must leave you now."

But he held me by the hand, forcing out tidbits of information.
He was like a ravenous wolf, I <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> in amusement; the longer I
spoke, the more hungrily he sniffed for news. Inwardly I petitioned
the Goddess Kali to devise a graceful means of escape.

My companion <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> me abruptly. I sighed with relief and doubled my
pace, dreading any relapse into the garrulous fever. Hearing rapid
footsteps behind me, I quickened my speed. I dared not look back.
But with a bound, the youth rejoined me, jovially clasping my
shoulder.

"I forgot to tell you of Gandha Baba (Perfume Saint), who is gracing
yonder house." He pointed to a dwelling a few yards distant. "Do
meet him; he is interesting. You may have an unusual experience.
Good-by," and he actually <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> me.

The similarly worded prediction of the SADHU at Kalighat Temple
flashed to my mind. Definitely intrigued, I entered the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> and
was ushered into a commodious parlor. A crowd of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> were sitting,
Orient-wise, here and there on a thick orange-colored carpet. An
awed whisper reached my ear:

"Behold Gandha Baba on the leopard skin. He can give the natural
perfume of any flower to a scentless one, or revive a wilted blossom,
or make a person's skin exude delightful fragrance."

I looked directly at the saint; his quick gaze rested on mine. He
was plump and bearded, with dark skin and large, gleaming eyes.

"Son, I am glad to see you. Say what you want. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Would</span> you like some
perfume?"

"What for?" I <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> his remark rather childish.

"To experience the miraculous <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> of enjoying perfumes."

"Harnessing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> to make odors?"

"What of it? <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> makes perfume anyway."

"Yes, but He fashions frail bottles of petals for fresh <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> and

discard. Can you materialize flowers?"

"I materialize perfumes, little friend."

"Then scent factories will go out of business."

"I will permit them to keep their trade! My own purpose is to
demonstrate the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of God."

"Sir, is it necessary to prove God? Isn't He performing miracles
in everything, everywhere?"

"Yes, but we too should manifest some of His infinite creative
variety."

"How <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> did it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> to <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> your art?"

"Twelve years."

"For manufacturing scents by astral means! It seems, my honored
saint, you have been wasting a dozen <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> for fragrances which
you can obtain with a few rupees from a florist's shop."

"Perfumes fade with flowers."

"Perfumes fade with death. Why should I <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> that which pleases
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> only?"

"Mr. Philosopher, you please my mind. Now, stretch forth your right
hand." He made a gesture of blessing.

I was a few feet away from Gandha Baba; no one else was near
enough to contact my body. I extended my hand, which the yogi did
not touch.

"What perfume do you want?"

"Rose."

"Be it so."

To my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> surprise, the charming fragrance of rose was wafted
strongly from the center of my palm. I smilingly <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> a large white
scentless flower from a near-by vase.

"Can this odorless blossom be permeated with jasmine?"

"Be it so."

A jasmine fragrance instantly shot from the petals. I thanked the

wonder-worker and seated myself by one of his students. He informed
me that Gandha Baba, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> proper name was Vishudhananda, had
learned many astonishing yoga secrets from a <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> in Tibet. The
Tibetan yogi, I was assured, had attained the age of over a <span class="t15 t23 hoverable">thousand</span>
years.

"His disciple Gandha Baba does not always perform his perfume-feats
in the simple verbal manner you have just witnessed." The student
spoke with obvious pride in his master. "His procedure differs
widely, to accord with diversity in temperaments. He is marvelous!
Many members of the Calcutta intelligentsia are among his followers."

I inwardly resolved not to add myself to their number. A guru too
literally "marvelous" was not to my liking. With polite thanks to
Gandha Baba, I departed. Sauntering home, I reflected on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span>
varied encounters the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> had <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> forth.

My sister Uma met me as I entered our Gurpar Road door.

"You are getting quite stylish, using perfumes!"

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Without</span> a word, I motioned her to smell my hand.

"What an attractive rose fragrance! It is unusually strong!"

Thinking it was "strongly unusual," I silently placed the astrally
scented blossom under her nostrils.

"Oh, I <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t8 t13 t15 t17 t18 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> jasmine!" She seized the flower. A ludicrous bafflement
passed over her face as she repeatedly sniffed the odor of jasmine
from a type of flower she <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> knew to be scentless. Her reactions
disarmed my suspicion that Gandha Baba had induced an auto-suggestive
<span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> whereby I alone could detect the fragrances.

Later I <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> from a friend, Alakananda, that the "Perfume Saint"
had a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> which I wish were possessed by the starving millions
of Asia and, today, of Europe as well.

"I was present with a hundred other guests at Gandha Baba's home
in Burdwan," Alakananda told me. "It was a gala occasion. Because
the yogi was reputed to have the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of extracting objects
out of thin air, I laughingly requested him to materialize some
out-of-season tangerines. Immediately the LUCHIS {FN5-4} which
were present on all the banana-leaf plates became puffed up. Each
of the bread-envelopes proved to contain a peeled tangerine. I bit
into my own with some trepidation, but found it delicious."

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Years</span> later I understood by inner realization how Gandha Baba
accomplished his materializations. The method, alas! is beyond the
reach of the world's hungry hordes.

The different sensory stimuli to which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> reacts-tactual, visual,
gustatory, auditory, and olfactory-are produced by vibratory
variations in electrons and protons. The vibrations in turn are
regulated by "lifetrons," subtle <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> forces or finer-than-atomic
energies intelligently charged with the five distinctive sensory
idea-substances.

Gandha Baba, tuning himself with the cosmic force by certain yogic
practices, was able to guide the lifetrons to rearrange their
vibratory structure and objectivize the desired result. His perfume,
fruit and other miracles were actual materializations of mundane
vibrations, and not inner sensations hypnotically produced. {FN5-5}

Performances of miracles such as shown by the "Perfume Saint" are
spectacular but spiritually useless. Having little purpose beyond
entertainment, they are digressions from a serious search for God.

Hypnotism has been <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> by physicians in minor operations as a sort

anesthetic. But a hypnotic <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> is harmful to those often subjected to
it; a negative psychological effect ensues which in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> deranges
the brain cells. Hypnotism is trespass into the territory of
another's consciousness. Its temporary phenomena have nothing in
common with the miracles performed by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> realization.

means of a will harmoniously attuned to the Creative Cosmic Dreamer.

Ostentatious display of unusual powers are decried by masters. The
Persian mystic, Abu Said, once laughed at certain FAKIRS who were
proud of their miraculous powers over water, air, and space.

"A frog is also at home in the water!" Abu Said pointed out in gentle
scorn. "The crow and the vulture easily fly in the air; the Devil
is simultaneously present in the East and in the West! A <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span>

On another occasion the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Persian teacher gave his views on

(selfish desires and ambitions); to freely bestow what you have in
your hand; and never to flinch from the blows of adversity!"

Neither the impartial sage at Kalighat Temple nor the Tibetan-trained
yogi had satisfied my yearning for a guru. My <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> needed no
tutor for its recognitions, and cried its own "Bravos!" the more
resoundingly because unoften summoned from silence. When I finally
met my master, he taught me by sublimity of example alone the
measure of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> man.

the world. The eminent French chemist, M. Georges Claude, performed
"miracles" at Fontainebleau in 1928 before a scientific assemblage
through his chemical <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of oxygen transformations. His
"magician's wand" was simple oxygen, bubbling in a tube on a table.
The scientist "turned a handful of sand into precious stones,
iron into a <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> resembling melted chocolate and, after depriving
flowers of their tints, turned them into the consistency of glass.

"M. Claude explained how the sea could be turned by oxygen
transformations into many millions of pounds of horsepower; how
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> which boils is not necessarily burning; how little mounds of
sand, by a single whiff of the oxygen blowpipe, could be changed
into sapphires, rubies, and topazes; and he predicted the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> when

the diver's equipment. Finally the scientist amazed his onlookers
by turning their faces black by taking the red out of the sun's
rays."

This noted French scientist has produced liquid air by an expansion
method in which he has been able to separate the various gases of
the air, and has discovered various means of mechanical utilization
of differences of temperature in sea water.

CHAPTER: 6

THE TIGER SWAMI

"I have discovered the Tiger Swami's address. Let us visit him
tomorrow."

This welcome suggestion came from Chandi, one of my <span class="t23 hoverable">high</span> school
friends. I was eager to meet the saint who, in his premonastic
life, had caught and fought tigers with his naked hands. A boyish
enthusiasm over such remarkable feats was strong <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> me.

The next <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> dawned wintry cold, but Chandi and I sallied forth
gaily. After much vain hunting in Bhowanipur, outside Calcutta, we
arrived at the right house. The door held <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> iron rings, which I
sounded piercingly. Notwithstanding the clamor, a servant approached
with leisurely gait. His ironical smile implied that visitors,
despite their noise, were powerless to disturb the calmness of a
saint's home.

Feeling the silent rebuke, my companion and I were thankful to be
invited into the parlor. Our <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> wait there caused uncomfortable
misgivings. India's unwritten <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">law</span> for the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> seeker is patience;
a <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> may purposely make a test of one's eagerness to meet him.

This psychological ruse is freely employed in the West by doctors
and dentists!

Finally summoned by the servant, Chandi and I entered a sleeping
apartment. The famous Sohong {FN6-1} Swami was seated on his bed.
The sight of his tremendous <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> affected us strangely. With bulging
eyes, we stood speechless. We had never before seen such a chest or
such football-like biceps. On an immense neck, the swami's fierce
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> calm face was adorned with flowing locks, beard and moustache.
A hint of dovelike and tigerlike qualities shone in his dark eyes.
He was unclothed, save for a tiger skin about his muscular waist.

Finding our voices, my friend and I greeted the monk, expressing
our admiration for his prowess in the extraordinary feline arena.

"Will you not tell us, please, how it is possible to subdue with
bare fists the most ferocious of jungle beasts, the royal Bengals?"

"My sons, it is nothing to me to fight tigers. I could do it today
if necessary." He gave a childlike laugh. "You look <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> tigers as
tigers; I know them as pussycats."

"Swamiji, I think I could impress my subconsciousness with the
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> that tigers are pussycats, but could I make tigers believe
it?"

"Of course strength also is necessary! One cannot expect victory
from a baby who imagines a tiger to be a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> cat! Powerful <span class="t13 t23 hoverable">hands</span>
are my sufficient weapon."

He asked us to follow him to the patio, where he struck the edge
of a wall. A brick crashed to the floor; the sky peered boldly
through the gaping lost tooth of the wall. I fairly staggered in
astonishment; he who can remove mortared bricks from a solid wall
with one blow, I thought, must surely be able to displace the teeth
of tigers!

"A <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> have <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> such as mine, but still lack
in cool confidence. Those who are bodily but not mentally stalwart
may <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> themselves fainting at mere sight of a wild beast bounding
freely in the jungle. The tiger in its natural ferocity and habitat
is vastly different from the opium-fed circus animal!

"Many a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> with herculean strength has nonetheless been terrorized
into abject helplessness before the onslaught of a royal Bengal.
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> the tiger has converted the man, in his own mind, to a <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span>
as nerveless as the pussycat's. It is possible for a man, owning a
fairly strong <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> and an immensely strong determination, to turn
the tables on the tiger, and force it to a conviction of pussycat
defenselessness. How often I have done just that!"

I was quite willing to believe that the titan before me was able to
perform the tiger-pussycat metamorphosis. He seemed in a didactic
mood; Chandi and I listened respectfully.

"Mind is the wielder of muscles. The force of a hammer blow depends
on the energy applied; the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> expressed by a man's bodily instrument
depends on his aggressive will and courage. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> is literally
manufactured and sustained by mind. Through pressure of instincts
from past lives, strengths or weaknesses percolate gradually into
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> consciousness. They express as habits, which in turn ossify
into a desirable or an undesirable body. Outward frailty has
mental origin; in a vicious circle, the habit-bound <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> thwarts
the mind. If the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> allows himself to be commanded by a servant,
the latter becomes autocratic; the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> is similarly enslaved by
submitting to bodily dictation."

At our entreaty, the impressive swami consented to tell us something
of his own life.

"My earliest ambition was to fight tigers. My will was mighty, but
my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> was feeble."

An ejaculation of surprise broke from me. It appeared incredible
that this man, now "with Atlantean shoulders, fit to bear," could

ever have known weakness.

"It was by indomitable persistency in thoughts of health and
strength that I overcame my handicap. I have every <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> to extol
the compelling mental vigor which I found to be the real subduer
of royal Bengals."

"Do you think, revered swami, that I could ever fight tigers?" This
was the first, and the last, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> that the bizarre ambition ever
visited my mind!

"Yes." He was smiling. "But there are many kinds of tigers; some
roam in jungles of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> desires. No <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> benefit accrues
by knocking beasts unconscious. Rather be victor over the inner
prowlers."

"May we hear, sir, how you changed from a tamer of wild tigers to
a tamer of wild passions?"

The Tiger Swami fell into silence. Remoteness came into his gaze,
summoning visions of bygone years. I discerned his slight mental
struggle to decide <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> to grant my request. Finally he smiled
in acquiescence.

"When my fame reached a zenith, it <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> the intoxication of

pride. I decided not only to fight tigers but to display them in
various tricks. My ambition was to force savage beasts to behave
like domesticated ones. I began to perform my feats publicly, with
gratifying success.

"One evening my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">father</span> entered my room in pensive mood.

"'Son, I have <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> of warning. I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> save you from coming ills,
produced by the grinding wheels of cause and effect.'

"'Are you a fatalist, Father? Should superstition be allowed to
discolor the powerful waters or my activities?'

"'I am no fatalist, son. But I believe in the just <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">law</span> of retribution,
as taught in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">holy</span> scriptures. There is resentment against you
in the jungle family; sometime it may act to your cost.'

"'Father, you astonish me! You <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> know what tigers are-beautiful
but merciless! Even immediately after an enormous meal of some
hapless creature, a tiger is fired with fresh lust at sight of new
prey. It may be a joyous gazelle, frisking over the jungle grass.
Capturing it and biting an opening in the soft throat, the malevolent
beast tastes only a little of the mutely crying blood, and goes
its wanton way.

"'Tigers are the most contemptible of the jungle breed! Who knows?
my blows may inject some slight sanity of consideration into their
thick heads. I am headmaster in a forest finishing school, to teach
them gentle manners!

"'Please, Father, think of me as tiger tamer and never as tiger
killer. How could my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> actions <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> ill <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> me? I beg you not
to impose any command that I change my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> of life.'"

Chandi and I were all attention, understanding the past dilemma.
In India a child does not lightly disobey his parents' wishes.

"In stoic silence <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Father</span> listened to my explanation. He followed
it with a disclosure which he uttered gravely.

"'Son, you compel me to relate an ominous prediction from the lips
of a saint. He approached me yesterday as I sat on the veranda in
my daily meditation.

"'"Dear friend, I come with a message for your belligerent son. Let
him cease his savage activities. Otherwise, his next tiger-encounter
shall result in his severe wounds, followed by six months of deathly
sickness. He shall then forsake his former ways and become a monk."'

"This tale did not impress me. I considered that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Father</span> had been

the credulous victim of a deluded fanatic."

The Tiger Swami made this confession with an impatient gesture, as
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> at some stupidity. Grimly silent for a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> time, he seemed
oblivious of our presence. When he <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> up the dangling thread of
his narrative, it was suddenly, with subdued voice.

"Not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> after Father's warning, I visited the capital <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">city</span> of
Cooch Behar. The picturesque territory was new to me, and I expected
a restful change. As usual everywhere, a curious crowd followed me
on the streets. I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> catch bits of whispered comment:

"'This is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> who fights wild tigers.'

"'Has he legs, or tree-trunks?'

"'Look at his face! He must be an incarnation of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> of tigers
himself!'

"You know how village urchins function like final editions of a
newspaper! With what speed do the even-later speech-bulletins of
the women circulate from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> to house! <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">Within</span> a few hours, the

"I was relaxing quietly in the evening, when I <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> the hoofbeats

of galloping horses. They stopped in front of my dwelling place.
In came a <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> of tall, turbaned policemen.

"I was <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> aback. 'All <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> are possible <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">unto</span> these creatures
of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> law,' I thought. 'I wonder if they are going to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> me to
task about matters utterly unknown to me.' But the officers bowed
with unwonted courtesy.

"'Honored Sir, we are sent to welcome you on behalf of the Prince
of Cooch Behar. He is pleased to invite you to his palace tomorrow
morning.'

"I speculated awhile on the prospect. For some obscure <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> I
felt sharp regret at this interruption in my quiet trip. But the
suppliant manner of the policemen moved me; I agreed to go.

"I was bewildered the next <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> to be obsequiously escorted from my
door into a magnificent coach drawn by four horses. A servant held
an ornate umbrella to protect me from the scorching sunlight. I
enjoyed the pleasant ride through the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">city</span> and its woodland outskirts.
The royal scion himself was at the palace door to welcome me. He
proffered his own gold-brocaded seat, smilingly placing himself in
a chair of simpler design.

"'All this politeness is certainly going to cost me something!' I

thought in mounting astonishment. The prince's motive emerged after
a few casual remarks.

"'My <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">city</span> is filled with the rumor that you can fight wild tigers
with nothing more than your naked hands. Is it a fact?'

"'It is quite true.'

"'I can scarcely believe it! You are a Calcutta Bengali, nurtured
on the white rice of <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">city</span> folk. Be frank, please; have you not been
fighting only spineless, opium-fed animals?' His <span class="t23 hoverable">voice</span> was loud
and sarcastic, tinged with provincial accent.

"I vouchsafed no reply to his insulting question.

"'I challenge you to fight my newly-caught tiger, Raja Begum.
{FN6-2} If you can successfully resist him, bind him with a chain,
and leave his cage in a conscious state, you shall have this royal
Bengal! Several <span class="t15 t23 hoverable">thousand</span> rupees and many other gifts shall also be
bestowed. If you refuse to meet him in combat, I shall blazon your
name throughout the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> as an impostor!'

"His insolent <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> struck me like a volley of bullets. I shot an
angry acceptance. Half risen from the chair in his excitement, the
prince sank back with a sadistic smile. I was reminded of the Roman

emperors who delighted in setting Christians in bestial arenas.

"'The match will be <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> for a week hence. I regret that I cannot
give you permission to <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> the tiger in advance.'

"Whether the prince feared I might seek to hypnotize the beast, or
secretly feed him opium, I know not!

"I <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> the palace, noting with amusement that the royal umbrella
and panoplied coach were now missing.

"The following week I methodically prepared my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> for
the coming ordeal. Through my servant I learned of fantastic tales.
The saint's direful prediction to my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">father</span> had somehow got abroad,
enlarging as it ran. Many simple villagers believed that an <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span>
spirit, cursed by the gods, had reincarnated as a tiger which <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span>
various demoniac forms at night, but remained a striped animal
during the day. This demon-tiger was supposed to be the one sent
to humble me.

"Another imaginative version was that animal prayers to Tiger
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Heaven</span> had achieved a response in the shape of Raja Begum. He was
to be the instrument to punish me-the audacious biped, so insulting
to the entire tiger species! A furless, fangless <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> daring
to challenge a claw-armed, sturdy-limbed tiger! The concentrated

venom of all humiliated tigers-the villagers declared-had gathered
momentum sufficient to operate hidden laws and <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> about the fall
of the proud tiger tamer.

"My servant further apprized me that the prince was in his element
as manager of the bout between <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> and beast. He had supervised
the erection of a storm-proof pavilion, designed to accommodate
thousands. Its center held Raja Begum in an enormous iron cage,
surrounded by an outer safety room. The captive emitted a ceaseless
series of blood-curdling roars. He was fed sparingly, to kindle a
wrathful appetite. Perhaps the prince expected me to be the meal
of reward!

"Crowds from the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">city</span> and suburbs bought tickets eagerly in response
to the beat of drums announcing the unique contest. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> of
battle saw hundreds turned away for lack of seats. Many <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> broke
through the tent openings, or crowded any space below the galleries."

As the Tiger Swami's story approached a climax, my excitement
mounted with it; Chandi also was raptly mute.

"Amidst piercing sound-explosions from Raja Begum, and the hubbub
of the somewhat terrified crowd, I quietly made my appearance. Scantily
clad around the waist, I was otherwise unprotected by clothing. I
opened the bolt on the door of the safety room and calmly locked

it behind me. The tiger sensed blood. Leaping with a thunderous
crash on his bars, he sent forth a fearsome welcome. The audience
was hushed with pitiful fear; I seemed a meek lamb before the raging
beast.

"In a trice I was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the cage; but as I slammed the door, Raja
Begum was headlong <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> me. My right <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> was desperately torn.
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Human</span> blood, the greatest treat a tiger can know, fell in appalling
streams. The prophecy of the saint seemed about to be fulfilled.

"I rallied instantly from the shock of the first serious injury
I had ever received. Banishing the sight of my gory fingers by
thrusting them beneath my waist cloth, I swung my <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> arm in a
bone-cracking blow. The beast reeled back, swirled around the rear
of the cage, and sprang forward convulsively. My famous fistic
punishment rained on his head.

"But Raja Begum's taste of blood had acted like the maddening first
sip of wine to a dipsomaniac long-deprived. Punctuated by deafening
roar, the brute's assaults grew in fury. My inadequate defense
of only one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> me vulnerable before claws and fangs. But I
dealt out dazing retribution. Mutually ensanguined, we struggled
as to the death. The cage was pandemonium, as blood splashed in
all directions, and blasts of pain and lethal lust came from the
bestial throat.

"'Shoot him!' 'Kill the tiger!' Shrieks arose from the audience.
So fast did <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> and beast move, that a guard's bullet <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> amiss.
I mustered all my will force, bellowed fiercely, and landed a final
concussive blow. The tiger collapsed and lay quietly.

"Like a pussycat!" I interjected.

The swami laughed in hearty appreciation, then continued the
engrossing tale.

"Raja Begum was vanquished at last. His royal pride was further
humbled: with my lacerated hands, I audaciously forced open his
jaws. For a dramatic moment, I held my <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the yawning
deathtrap. I looked around for a chain. Pulling one from a pile
on the floor, I bound the tiger by his neck to the cage bars. In
triumph I moved toward the door.

"But that fiend incarnate, Raja Begum, had stamina worthy of his
supposed demoniac origin. With an incredible lunge, he snapped
the chain and leaped on my back. My shoulder fast in his jaws, I
fell violently. But in a trice I had him pinned beneath me. Under
merciless blows, the treacherous animal sank into semiconsciousness.
This <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> I secured him more carefully. Slowly I <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> the cage.

"I found myself in a new uproar, this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> one of delight. The crowd's
cheer broke as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> from a single gigantic throat. Disastrously
mauled, I had <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> fulfilled the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> conditions of the fight-stunning
the tiger, binding him with a chain, and leaving him <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span>
requiring assistance for myself. In addition, I had so drastically
injured and frightened the aggressive beast that he had been content
to overlook the opportune prize of my <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> in his mouth!

"After my wounds were treated, I was honored and garlanded; hundreds of
gold pieces showered at my feet. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">city</span> entered a holiday
period. Endless discussions were <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> on all sides about my
victory over one of the largest and most savage tigers ever seen.
Raja Begum was presented to me, as promised, but I felt no elation.
A <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> change had entered my heart. It seemed that with my
final exit from the cage I had also closed the door on my worldly
ambitions.

"A woeful period followed. For six months I lay near <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">death</span> from
blood poisoning. As soon as I was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> enough to leave Cooch Behar,
I returned to my native town.

"'I know now that my teacher is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">holy</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> who gave the <span class="t8 t12 t17 hoverable">wise</span>
warning.' I humbly made this confession to my father. 'Oh, if I
could only <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> him!' My longing was sincere, for one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> the saint
arrived unheralded.

"I was initiated into the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> path by my saintly guru. He
opened my soul-doors, rusty and resistant with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> disuse. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Hand</span>

Chandi and I bowed at the swami's feet, grateful for his vivid
outline of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> truly cyclonic.

probationary wait in the cold parlor!

{FN6-1} SOHONG was his monastic name. He was popularly known as
the "Tiger Swami."

{FN6-2} "Prince Princess"-so named to indicate that this beast
possessed the combined ferocity of tiger and tigress.

CHAPTER: 7

THE LEVITATING SAINT

"I saw a yogi remain in the air, several feet above the ground,
last night at a group meeting." My friend, Upendra Mohun Chowdhury,
spoke impressively.

I gave him an enthusiastic smile. "Perhaps I can guess his name.
Was it Bhaduri Mahasaya, of Upper Circular Road?"

Upendra nodded, a little crestfallen not to be a news-bearer. My
inquisitiveness about saints was well-known among my friends; they
delighted in setting me on a fresh track.

"The yogi lives so close to my home that I often visit him." My
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> keen interest to Upendra's face, and I made a further
confidence.

"I have seen him in remarkable feats. He has expertly mastered the
various PRANAYAMAS {FN7-1} of the ancient eightfold yoga outlined
by Patanjali. {FN7-2} Once Bhaduri Mahasaya performed the BHASTRIKA
PRANAYAMA before me with such amazing force that it seemed an actual
storm had arisen in the room! Then he extinguished the thundering
breath and remained motionless in a <span class="t23 hoverable">high</span> <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of superconsciousness.
{FN7-3} The aura of <span class="t13 hoverable">peace</span> after the storm was vivid beyond forgetting."

"I <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> that the saint never leaves his home." Upendra's tone was

a trifle incredulous.

"Indeed it is true! He has lived indoors for the past twenty years.
He slightly relaxes his self-imposed rule at the times of our <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">holy</span>
festivals, when he goes as far as his front sidewalk! The beggars
gather there, because Saint Bhaduri is known for his tender heart."

"How does he remain in the air, defying the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">law</span> of gravitation?"

"A yogi's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> loses its grossness after <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> of certain PRANAYAMAS.
Then it will levitate or hop about like a leaping frog. Even
saints who do not practice a formal yoga {FN7-4} have been known
to levitate during a <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of intense devotion to God."

"I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> like to know more of this sage. Do you attend his evening
meetings?" Upendra's <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> were sparkling with curiosity.

"Yes, I go often. I am vastly entertained by the wit in his
wisdom. Occasionally my prolonged laughter mars the solemnity of
his gatherings. The saint is not displeased, but his disciples look
daggers!"

On my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> home from school that afternoon, I passed Bhaduri Mahasaya's
cloister and decided on a visit. The yogi was inaccessible to the
general public. A lone disciple, occupying the ground floor, guarded

his master's privacy. The student was something of a martinet; he
now inquired formally if I had an "engagement." His guru put in an
appearance just in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> to save me from summary ejection.

"Let Mukunda come when he will." The sage's <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> twinkled. "My rule
of seclusion is not for my own comfort, but for that of others.
Worldly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> do not like the candor which shatters their delusions.
Saints are not only rare but disconcerting. Even in scripture, they
are often found embarrassing!"

I followed Bhaduri Mahasaya to his austere quarters on the top floor,
from which he seldom stirred. Masters often ignore the panorama
of the world's ado, out of focus till centered in the ages. The
contemporaries of a sage are not alone those of the narrow present.

"Maharishi, {FN7-5} you are the first yogi I have known who always
stays indoors."

"God plants his saints sometimes in unexpected soil, lest we think
we may reduce Him to a rule!"

The sage locked his vibrant <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> in the lotus posture. In his
seventies, he displayed no unpleasing signs of age or sedentary life.
Stalwart and straight, he was ideal in every respect. His face was
that of a RISHI, as described in the ancient texts. Noble-headed,

abundantly bearded, he always sat firmly upright, his quiet <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span>
fixed on Omnipresence.

The saint and I entered the meditative state. After an hour, his
gentle <span class="t23 hoverable">voice</span> roused me.

"You go often into the silence, but have you developed ANUBHAVA?"
{FN7-6} He was reminding me to <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t8 t13 t15 t17 t18 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> more than meditation. "Do
not mistake the technique for the Goal."

He offered me some mangoes. With that good-humored wit that I found
so delightful in his grave nature, he remarked, "People in general
are more fond of JALA YOGA (union with food) than of DHYANA YOGA
(union with God)."

His yogic pun affected me uproariously.

"What a laugh you have!" An affectionate gleam came into his gaze.
His own face was always serious, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> touched with an ecstatic smile.
His large, lotus <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> held a hidden <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> laughter.

"Those letters come from far-off America." The sage indicated several
thick envelopes on a table. "I correspond with a few societies
there <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> members are interested in yoga. They are discovering
India anew, with a better <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> of direction than Columbus! I am

glad to help them. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of yoga is <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> to all who will
receive, like the ungarnishable daylight.

"What RISHIS perceived as essential for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> salvation need not
be diluted for the West. Alike in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> diverse in outer
experience, neither West nor East will flourish if some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of
disciplinary yoga be not practiced."

The saint held me with his tranquil eyes. I did not realize that
his speech was a veiled prophetic guidance. It is only now, as I
write these words, that I understand the <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span> <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> in the casual
intimations he often gave me that someday I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> carry India's
teachings to America.

[Illustration: BHADURI MAHASAYA, "The Levitating Saint" "Sir,"
I inquired, "why do you not write a <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">book</span> on yoga for the benefit
of the world?" "I am training disciples," He replied. "They and
their students will be living volumes, proof against the natural
disintegrations of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> and the unnatural interpretaations of the
critics."--see badhuri.jpg]

"Maharishi, I wish you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> write a <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">book</span> on yoga for the benefit
of the world."

"I am training disciples. They and their students will be living

volumes, proof against the natural disintegrations of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> and the
unnatural interpretations of the critics." Bhaduri's wit put me
into another gale of laughter.

I remained alone with the yogi until his disciples arrived in the
evening. Bhaduri Mahasaya entered one of his inimitable discourses.
Like a peaceful flood, he swept away the mental debris of his listeners,
floating them Godward. His striking parables were expressed in a
flawless Bengali.

This evening Bhaduri expounded various philosophical points
connected with the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of Mirabai, a medieval Rajputani princess
who abandoned her court <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> to seek the company of sadhus. One
great-sannyasi refused to receive her because she was a woman; her
reply <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> him humbly to her feet.

"Tell the master," she had said, "that I did not know there was
any Male in the universe save God; are we all not females before
Him?" (A scriptural conception of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> as the only Positive
Creative Principle, His <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span> being naught but a passive MAYA.)

Mirabai composed many ecstatic songs which are still treasured in
India; I translate one of them here:

"If by bathing daily <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> could be realized

The only indispensable is Love."

Several students put rupees in Bhaduri's slippers which lay by his
<span class="t6 hoverable">side</span> as he sat in yoga posture. This respectful offering, customary
in India, indicates that the disciple places his material goods at
the guru's feet. Grateful friends are only the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> in disguise,
looking after His own.

"Master, you are wonderful!" A student, taking his leave, gazed
ardently at the patriarchal sage. "You have renounced riches and
comforts to seek <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> and teach us wisdom!" It was well-known that
Bhaduri Mahasaya had forsaken <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> family wealth in his early
childhood, when single-mindedly he entered the yogic path.

"You are reversing the case!" The saint's face held a mild rebuke.
"I have <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> a few paltry rupees, a few petty pleasures, for a cosmic
empire of endless bliss. How then have I denied myself anything?
I know the joy of sharing the treasure. Is that a sacrifice? The
shortsighted worldly folk are verily the real renunciates! They
relinquish an unparalleled <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> possession for a poor handful of
earthly toys!"

I chuckled over this paradoxical <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of renunciation-one which
puts the cap of Croesus on any saintly beggar, whilst transforming
all proud millionaires into unconscious martyrs.

"The <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> arranges our future more wisely than any insurance
company." The master's concluding <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> were the realized creed
of his faith. "The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> is <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span> of uneasy believers in an outward

I continued my after-school pilgrimages to the saint's door. With
silent zeal he aided me to attain ANUBHAVA. One <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> he moved to
Ram Mohan Roy Road, away from the neighborhood of my Gurpar Road
home. His loving disciples had built him a new hermitage, known as
"Nagendra Math." {FN7-7}

Although it throws me ahead of my story by a <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> of years, I
will recount here the last <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> given to me by Bhaduri Mahasaya.
Shortly before I embarked for the West, I sought him out and humbly
knelt for his farewell blessing:

"Son, go to America. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Take</span> the dignity of hoary India for your

{FN7-3} French professors were the first in the West to be willing
to scientifically investigate the possibilities of the superconscious
mind. Professor Jules-Bois, member of the L'Ecole de Psychologie of
the Sorbonne, lectured in America in 1928; he told his audiences that
French scientists have accorded recognition to the superconsciousness,
"which is the exact opposite of Freud's subconscious <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> and is the
faculty which makes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> really <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> and not just a super-animal." M.
Jules-Bois explained that the awakening of the <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span>
"was not to be confused with Coueism or hypnotism. The <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span>
of a superconscious <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> has <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> been recognized philosophically,

being in reality the Oversoul spoken of by Emerson, but only recently
has it been recognized scientifically." The French scientist pointed
out that from the superconsciousness come inspiration, genius, moral
values. "Belief in this is not mysticism <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> it recognized and

CHAPTER: 8

INDIA'S <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">GREAT</span> SCIENTIST, J.C. BOSE

"Jagadis Chandra Bose's wireless inventions antedated those of
Marconi."

Overhearing this provocative remark, I walked closer to a sidewalk
group of professors engaged in scientific discussion. If my motive
in joining them was racial pride, I regret it. I cannot deny my
keen interest in evidence that India can play a leading part in
physics, and not metaphysics alone.

"What do you mean, sir?"

The professor obligingly explained. "Bose was the first one to invent
a wireless coherer and an instrument for indicating the refraction
of electric waves. But the Indian scientist did not exploit his
inventions commercially. He soon turned his attention from the
inorganic to the organic world. His revolutionary discoveries as a
plant physiologist are outpacing even his radical achievements as
a physicist."

I politely thanked my mentor. He added, "The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> scientist is
one of my brother professors at Presidency College."

I paid a visit the next <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> to the sage at his home, which was close
to mine on Gurpar Road. I had <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> admired him from a respectful
distance. The grave and retiring botanist greeted me graciously. He
was a handsome, robust <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> in his fifties, with thick hair, broad
forehead, and the abstracted <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> of a dreamer. The precision in
his tones revealed the lifelong scientific habit.

"I have recently returned from an expedition to scientific societies
of the West. Their members exhibited intense interest in delicate
instruments of my invention which demonstrate the indivisible unity
of all life. {FN8-1} The Bose crescograph has the enormity of ten
million magnifications. The microscope enlarges only a few <span class="t15 t23 hoverable">thousand</span>
times; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> it <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> vital impetus to biological science. The
crescograph opens incalculable vistas."

"You have done much, sir, to hasten the embrace of East and West
in the impersonal arms of science."

"I was educated at Cambridge. How admirable is the Western method
of submitting all theory to scrupulous experimental verification!
That empirical procedure has gone <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> with the gift for
introspection which is my Eastern heritage. <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Together</span> they have enabled
me to sunder the silences of natural realms <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> uncommunicative.
The telltale charts of my crescograph {FN8-2} are evidence for
the most skeptical that plants have a sensitive nervous system and
a varied emotional life. Love, hate, joy, fear, pleasure, pain,
excitability, stupor, and countless appropriate responses to stimuli
are as universal in plants as in animals."

"The unique throb of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> in all <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span> could seem only poetic
imagery before your advent, Professor! A saint I once knew <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span>

never pluck flowers. 'Shall I rob the rosebush of its pride in
beauty? Shall I cruelly affront its dignity by my rude divestment?'
His sympathetic <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> are verified literally through your discoveries!"

"The poet is intimate with truth, while the scientist approaches
awkwardly. Come someday to my laboratory and see the unequivocable
testimony of the crescograph."

Gratefully I accepted the invitation, and <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> my departure. I
<span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> later that the botanist had <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> Presidency College, and was
planning a research center in Calcutta.

When the Bose Institute was opened, I attended the dedicatory
services. Enthusiastic hundreds strolled over the premises. I was
charmed with the artistry and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> symbolism of the new home
of science. Its front gate, I noted, was a centuried relic from
a distant shrine. Behind the lotus {FN8-3} fountain, a sculptured
female figure with a torch conveyed the Indian respect for woman
as the immortal light-bearer. The garden held a small temple
consecrated to the Noumenon beyond phenomena. <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">Thought</span> of the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span>

Bose's speech on this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> occasion might have issued from the
lips of one of the inspired ancient RISHIS.

"I dedicate today this Institute as not merely a laboratory but
a temple." His reverent solemnity stole like an unseen cloak over
the crowded auditorium. "In the pursuit of my investigations I was
unconsciously led into the border region of physics and physiology.
To my amazement, I found boundary lines vanishing, and points
of contact emerging, between the realms of the living and the
non-living. Inorganic <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> was perceived as anything but inert;
it was athrill under the action of multitudinous forces.

"A universal reaction seemed to <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> metal, plant and animal under
a common law. They all exhibited essentially the same phenomena
of fatigue and depression, with possibilities of recovery and of
exaltation, as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as the permanent irresponsiveness associated
with death. Filled with awe at this stupendous generalization, it
was with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> hope that I announced my results before the Royal
Society--results demonstrated by experiments. But the physiologists
present advised me to confine myself to <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> investigations, in
which my success had been assured, rather than encroach on their
preserves. I had unwittingly strayed into the domain of an unfamiliar
caste system and so offended its etiquette.

"An unconscious theological bias was also present, which confounds
ignorance with faith. It is often forgotten that He who surrounded
us with this ever-evolving mystery of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span> has also implanted
in us the <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> to question and understand. Through many <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span>
of miscomprehension, I came to know that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of a devotee of

success and failure, as one.

through unnumbered transformations. Indians have always arisen who,
discarding the immediate and absorbing prize of the hour, have
sought for the realization of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> ideals in life-not through
passive renunciation, but through active struggle. The weakling
who has refused the conflict, acquiring nothing, has had nothing
to renounce. He alone who has striven and won can enrich the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span>
by bestowing the fruits of his victorious experience.

"The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> already carried out in the Bose laboratory on the
response of matter, and the unexpected revelations in plant life,

have opened out very extended regions of inquiry in physics, in
physiology, in medicine, in agriculture, and even in psychology.

"It is my further wish that the facilities of this Institute be

infinite patience."

Tears stood in my <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> at the scientist's concluding words. Is
"patience" not indeed a synonym of India, confounding <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Time</span> and the
historians alike?

I visited the research center again, soon after the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> of opening.
The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> botanist, mindful of his promise, <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> me to his quiet
laboratory.

"I will attach the crescograph to this fern; the magnification is
tremendous. If a snail's crawl were enlarged in the same proportion,
the creature <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> appear to be traveling like an express train!"

My gaze was fixed eagerly on the screen which reflected the magnified
fern-shadow. Minute life-movements were now clearly perceptible;
the plant was growing very slowly before my fascinated eyes. The
scientist touched the tip of the fern with a small metal bar. The
developing pantomime came to an abrupt halt, resuming the eloquent
rhythms as soon as the rod was withdrawn.

"You saw how any slight outside interference is detrimental to the
sensitive tissues," Bose remarked. "Watch; I will now administer
chloroform, and then give an antidote."

The effect of the chloroform discontinued all growth; the antidote
was revivifying. The evolutionary gestures on the screen held me
more raptly than a "movie" plot. My companion (here in the role
of villain) thrust a sharp instrument through a part of the fern;
pain was indicated by spasmodic flutters. When he passed a razor
partially through the stem, the shadow was violently agitated, then
stilled itself with the final punctuation of death.

"By first chloroforming a huge tree, I achieved a successful
transplantation. Usually, such monarchs of the forest die very
quickly after being moved." Jagadis smiled happily as he recounted
the life-saving maneuver. "Graphs of my delicate apparatus have
proved that trees possess a circulatory system; their sap movements

correspond to the blood pressure of animal bodies. The ascent of
sap is not explicable on the mechanical grounds ordinarily advanced,
such as capillary attraction. The phenomenon has been solved through
the crescograph as the activity of living cells. Peristaltic waves
issue from a cylindrical tube which extends down a tree and serves
as an actual heart! The more deeply we perceive, the more striking
becomes the evidence that a uniform plan links every <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> in manifold
nature."

The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> scientist pointed to another Bose instrument.

"I will show you experiments on a piece of tin. The life-force in
metals responds adversely or beneficially to stimuli. Ink markings
will register the various reactions."

Deeply engrossed, I watched the graph which recorded the characteristic
waves of atomic structure. When the professor applied chloroform
to the tin, the vibratory writings stopped. They recommenced as
the metal slowly regained its normal state. My companion dispensed
a poisonous chemical. Simultaneous with the quivering end of the
tin, the needle dramatically wrote on the chart a death-notice.

"Bose instruments have demonstrated that metals, such as the steel
<span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> in scissors and machinery, are subject to fatigue, and regain
efficiency by periodic rest. The life-pulse in metals is seriously

harmed or even extinguished through the application of electric
currents or heavy pressure."

I looked around the room at the numerous inventions, eloquent
testimony of a tireless ingenuity.

"Sir, it is lamentable that mass agricultural development is
not speeded by fuller <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> of your marvelous mechanisms. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Would</span> it
not be easily possible to employ some of them in quick laboratory
experiments to indicate the influence of various types of fertilizers
on plant growth?"

"You are right. Countless uses of Bose instruments will be made
by future generations. The scientist seldom knows contemporaneous
reward; it is enough to possess the joy of creative service."

With expressions of unreserved gratitude to the indefatigable sage,
I <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> my leave. "Can the astonishing fertility of his genius ever
be exhausted?" I thought.

No diminution came with the years. Inventing an intricate instrument,
the "Resonant Cardiograph," Bose then pursued extensive researches
on innumerable Indian plants. An enormous unsuspected pharmacopoeia
of useful drugs was revealed. The cardiograph is constructed with
an unerring accuracy by which a one-hundredth part of a <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span>

is indicated on a graph. Resonant records measure infinitesimal
pulsations in plant, animal and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> structure. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> botanist
predicted that <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> of his cardiograph will lead to vivisection on
plants instead of animals.

"Side by <span class="t6 hoverable">side</span> recordings of the effects of a medicine given
simultaneously to a plant and an animal have shown astounding
unanimity in result," he pointed out. "Everything in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> has been

contribute to lessening of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> suffering."

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Years</span> later Bose's pioneer plant findings were substantiated by other

by THE NEW YORK TIMES as follows:

nerves transmit messages between the brain and other parts of the
body, tiny electrical impulses are being generated. These impulses
have been measured by delicate galvanometers and magnified millions
of times by modern amplifying apparatus. Until now no satisfactory
method had been found to study the passages of the impulses along
the nerve fibers in living animals or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> because of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>

Drs. K. S. Cole and H. J. Curtis reported having discovered that the

long single cells of the fresh-water plant nitella, <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> frequently
in goldfish bowls, are virtually identical with those of single
nerve fibers. Furthermore, they found that nitella fibers, on being
excited, propagate electrical waves that are similar in every way,
except velocity, to those of the nerve fibers in animals and man.
The electrical nerve impulses in the plant were found to be much
slower than those in animals. This discovery was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> seized

{FN8-5} The atomic structure of <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> was well-known to the ancient

"Little sir, please be seated. I am talking to my <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Mother."

Silently I had entered the room in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> awe. The angelic
appearance of <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> Mahasaya fairly dazzled me. With silky white
beard and large lustrous eyes, he seemed an incarnation of purity.
His upraised chin and folded <span class="t13 t23 hoverable">hands</span> apprized me that my first visit
had disturbed him in the midst of his devotions.

His simple <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> of greeting produced the most violent effect my
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> had so far experienced. The bitter separation of my mother's
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">death</span> I had <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> the measure of all anguish. Now an agony at
separation from my <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Mother was an indescribable torture of
the spirit. I fell moaning to the floor.

"Little sir, quiet yourself!" The saint was sympathetically
distressed.

Abandoned in some oceanic desolation, I clutched his feet as the
sole raft of my rescue.

"Holy sir, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thy</span> intercession! Ask <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Mother if I <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> any favor
in Her sight!"

This promise is one not easily bestowed; the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> was constrained
to silence.

Beyond reach of doubt, I was convinced that <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> Mahasaya was in
intimate converse with the Universal Mother. It was deep humiliation
to realize that my <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> were blind to Her who even at this moment
was perceptible to the faultless gaze of the saint. Shamelessly
gripping his feet, deaf to his gentle remonstrances, I besought
him again and again for his intervening grace.

"I will make your plea to the Beloved." The master's capitulation
came with a slow, compassionate smile.

What <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> in those few words, that my being should know release
from its stormy exile?

"Sir, remember your pledge! I shall return soon for Her message!"
Joyful anticipation rang in my <span class="t23 hoverable">voice</span> that only a moment ago had
been sobbing in sorrow.

Descending the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> stairway, I was overwhelmed by memories. This
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> at 50 Amherst Street, now the residence of <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> Mahasaya,
had once been my family home, scene of my mother's death. Here
my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> had broken for the vanished mother; and here today
my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> had been as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> crucified by absence of the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span>
Mother. Hallowed walls, silent witness of my grievous hurts and
final healing!

My steps were eager as I returned to my Gurpar Road home. Seeking
the seclusion of my small attic, I remained in <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> until
ten o'clock. The darkness of the warm Indian night was suddenly
lit with a wondrous vision.

Haloed in splendor, the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Mother stood before me. Her face,
tenderly smiling, was beauty itself.

"Always have I loved thee! Ever shall I <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t8 t13 t15 t17 t18 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> thee!"

The celestial tones still ringing in the air, She disappeared.

The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> on the following morning had hardly risen to an angle of
decorum when I paid my <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> visit to <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> Mahasaya. Climbing
the staircase in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> of poignant memories, I reached his
fourth-floor room. The knob of the closed door was wrapped around
with a cloth; a hint, I felt, that the saint desired privacy. As
I stood irresolutely on the landing, the door was opened by the
master's welcoming hand. I knelt at his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">holy</span> feet. In a playful
mood, I wore a solemn mask over my face, hiding the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> elation.

"Sir, I have come-very early, I confess!-for your message. Did the
Beloved Mother say anything about me?"

"Mischievous little sir!"

Not another remark <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> he make. Apparently my assumed gravity
was unimpressive.

"Why so mysterious, so evasive? Do saints never <span class="t9 t11 t20 t21 t22 t23 t27 hoverable">speak</span> plainly?"
Perhaps I was a little provoked.

"Must you test me?" His calm <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> were <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span> of understanding. "Could
I add a single <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> this morning to the assurance you received last
night at ten o'clock from the Beautiful Mother Herself?"

<span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> Mahasaya possessed control over the flood-gates of my soul:

again I plunged prostrate at his feet. But this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> my tears welled
from a bliss, and not a pain, past bearing.

"Think you that your devotion did not touch the Infinite Mercy?
The Motherhood of God, that you have worshiped in forms both <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span>
and divine, could never fail to answer your forsaken cry."

Who was this simple saint, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> least request to the Universal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Spirit</span>
met with sweet acquiescence? His role in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> was humble, as
befitted the greatest <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> of humility I ever knew. In this Amherst
Street house, <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> Mahasaya {FN9-1} conducted a small <span class="t23 hoverable">high</span> school
for boys. No <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> of chastisement passed his lips; no rule and
ferule maintained his discipline. <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">Higher</span> mathematics indeed were
taught in these modest classrooms, and a chemistry of <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t8 t13 t15 t17 t18 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> absent
from the textbooks. He spread his <span class="t12 t20 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">wisdom</span> by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> contagion
rather than impermeable precept. Consumed by an unsophisticated
passion for the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Mother, the saint no more demanded the
outward forms of respect than a child.

"I am not your guru; he shall come a little later," he told me.
"Through his guidance, your experiences of the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> in terms of
<span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t8 t13 t15 t17 t18 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> and devotion shall be translated into his terms of fathomless
wisdom."

Every late afternoon, I betook myself to Amherst Street. I

sought <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> Mahasaya's <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> cup, so <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span> that its drops daily
overflowed on my being. Never before had I bowed in utter reverence;
now I felt it an immeasurable privilege even to tread the same
ground which <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> Mahasaya sanctified.

"Sir, please wear this champak garland I have fashioned especially
for you." I arrived one evening, holding my chain of flowers. But
shyly he drew away, repeatedly refusing the honor. Perceiving my
hurt, he finally smiled consent.

"Since we are both devotees of the Mother, you may put the garland
on this bodily temple, as <span class="t22 t23 t28 hoverable">offering</span> to Her who dwells within." His
vast <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> lacked space in which any egotistical consideration
could gain foothold.

"Let us go tomorrow to the Dakshineswar Temple, forever hallowed
by my guru." <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> Mahasaya was a disciple of a Christlike master,
Sri Ramakrishna Paramhansa.

The four-mile journey on the following morning was <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> by boat
on the Ganges. We entered the nine-domed Temple of Kali, where the
figures of the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Mother and Shiva rest on a burnished silver
lotus, its <span class="t15 t23 hoverable">thousand</span> petals meticulously chiseled. <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> Mahasaya
beamed in enchantment. He was engaged in his inexhaustible romance
with the Beloved. As he chanted Her name, my enraptured <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> seemed
shattered into a <span class="t15 t23 hoverable">thousand</span> pieces.

We strolled later through the sacred precincts, halting in a
tamarisk grove. The manna characteristically exuded by this tree
was symbolic of the heavenly <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> Mahasaya was bestowing.
His <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> invocations continued. I sat rigidly motionless on the
grass amid the pink feathery tamarisk flowers. Temporarily absent
from the body, I soared in a supernal visit.

This was the first of many pilgrimages to Dakshineswar with the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">holy</span>
teacher. From him I learned the sweetness of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> in the aspect of
Mother, or <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Mercy. The childlike saint found little appeal in
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Father</span> aspect, or <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Justice. Stern, exacting, mathematical
judgment was alien to his gentle nature.

"He can serve as an earthly prototype for the very angels of
heaven!" I <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> fondly, watching him one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> at his prayers.
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Without</span> a breath of censure or criticism, he surveyed the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span>
with <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> familiar with the Primal Purity. His body, mind,

speech, and actions were effortlessly harmonized with his soul's
simplicity.

"My <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> told me so." Shrinking from personal assertion, the
saint ended any sage counsel with this invariable tribute. So deep
was his identity with Sri Ramakrishna that <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> Mahasaya no longer
considered his thoughts as his own.

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Hand</span> in hand, the saint and I walked one evening on the block of his
school. My joy was dimmed by the arrival of a conceited acquaintance
who burdened us with a lengthy discourse.

"I see this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> doesn't please you." The saint's whisper to me was
unheard by the egotist, spellbound by his own monologue. "I have
spoken to <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Mother about it; She realizes our sad predicament.
As soon as we get to yonder red house, She has promised to remind
him of more urgent business."

My <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> were glued to the site of salvation. Reaching its red gate,
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> unaccountably turned and departed, neither finishing his
sentence nor saying good-by. The assaulted air was comforted with
peace.

Another <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> found me walking alone near the Howrah railway station.
I stood for a moment by a temple, silently criticizing a small group

of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> with drum and cymbals who were violently reciting a chant.

"How undevotionally they <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> the Lord's <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> name in mechanical
repetition," I reflected. My gaze was astonished by the rapid
approach of <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> Mahasaya. "Sir, how come you here?"

The saint, ignoring my question, answered my thought. "Isn't it
true, little sir, that the Beloved's name sounds sweet from all
lips, ignorant or wise?" He passed his arm around me affectionately;
I found myself carried on his magic carpet to the Merciful Presence.

"Would you like to see some bioscopes?" This question one afternoon
from <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> Mahasaya was mystifying; the term was then <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> in India
to signify motion pictures. I agreed, glad to be in his company in
any circumstances. A brisk walk <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> us to the garden fronting
Calcutta University. My companion indicated a bench near the GOLDIGHI
or pond.

"Let us sit here for a few minutes. My <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> always asked me
to meditate whenever I saw an expanse of water. Here its placidity
reminds us of the vast calmness of God. As all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> can be
reflected in water, so the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> universe is mirrored in the lake
of the Cosmic Mind. So my GURUDEVA often said."

Soon we entered a university hall where a lecture was in progress.

It proved abysmally dull, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> varied occasionally by lantern
slide illustrations, equally uninteresting.

"So this is the kind of bioscope the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> wanted me to see!" My
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> was impatient, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> not hurt the saint by revealing
boredom in my face. But he leaned toward me confidentially.

"I see, little sir, that you don't like this bioscope. I have
mentioned it to <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Mother; She is in <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span> sympathy with us
both. She tells me that the electric lights will now go out, and
won't be relit until we have a chance to leave the room."

As his whisper ended, the hall was plunged into darkness. The
professor's strident <span class="t23 hoverable">voice</span> was stilled in astonishment, then remarked,
"The electrical system of this hall appears to be defective." By
this time, <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> Mahasaya and I were safely across the threshold.
Glancing back from the corridor, I saw that the scene of our
martyrdom had again become illuminated.

"Little sir, you were disappointed in that bioscope, {FN9-2} but I
think you will like a different one." The saint and I were standing
on the sidewalk in front of the university building. He gently
slapped my chest over the heart.

A transforming silence ensued. Just as the modern "talkies" become

inaudible motion pictures when the sound apparatus goes out of
order, so the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Hand, by some strange miracle, stifled the
earthly bustle. The pedestrians as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as the passing trolley cars,
automobiles, bullock carts, and iron-wheeled hackney carriages were
all in noiseless transit. As <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> possessing an omnipresent eye,
I beheld the scenes which were behind me, and to each side, as
easily as those in front. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> spectacle of activity in that
small section of Calcutta passed before me <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> a sound. Like
a glow of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> dimly seen beneath a thin coat of ashes, a mellow
luminescence permeated the panoramic view.

My own <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> seemed nothing more than one of the many shadows,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> it was motionless, while the others flitted mutely to and
fro. Several boys, friends of mine, approached and passed on; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span>
they had looked directly at me, it was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> recognition.

The unique pantomime <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> me an inexpressible ecstasy. I drank
deep from some blissful fount. Suddenly my chest received another
soft blow from <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> Mahasaya. The pandemonium of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> burst
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> my unwilling ears. I staggered, as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> harshly awakened
from a gossamer dream. The transcendental wine removed beyond my
reach.

"Little sir, I see you found the <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> bioscope to your liking."
The saint was smiling; I started to drop in gratitude on the ground

before him. "You can't do that to me now; you know <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> is in your
temple also! I won't let <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Mother touch my feet through your
hands!"

If anyone observed the unpretentious <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> and myself as we walked
away from the crowded pavement, the onlooker surely suspected
us of intoxication. I felt that the falling shades of evening
were sympathetically drunk with God. When darkness recovered from
its nightly swoon, I faced the new morning bereft of my ecstatic
mood. But ever enshrined in memory is the seraphic <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span>
Mother-Master Mahasaya!

Trying with poor <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> to do justice to his benignity, I wonder if
<span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> Mahasaya, and others among the deep-visioned saints <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span>

I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be writing about their lives as <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> devotees. Their
foreknowledge <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> not surprise me nor, I hope, my readers, who
have come <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> far with me.

{FN9-1} These are respectful titles by which he was customarily
addressed. His name was Mahendra Nath Gupta; he signed his literary

{FN9-2} The Oxford English Dictionary gives, as rare, this definition
of BIOSCOPE: A <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of life; that which gives such a view.

Master Mahasaya's choice of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> was, then, peculiarly justified.

CHAPTER: 10

I MEET MY MASTER, SRI YUKTESWAR

"Faith in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> can produce any miracle except one-passing an
examination <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> study." Distastefully I closed the <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">book</span> I had
picked up in an idle moment.

"The writer's exception shows his complete lack of faith," I thought.
"Poor chap, he has <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> respect for the midnight oil!"

My promise to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Father</span> had been that I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> complete my <span class="t23 hoverable">high</span> school
studies. I cannot pretend to diligence. The passing months found me
less frequently in the classroom than in secluded spots along the
Calcutta bathing GHATS. The adjoining crematory grounds, especially
gruesome at night, are considered highly attractive by the yogi.
He who <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> the Deathless Essence must not be dismayed by a
few unadorned skulls. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Human</span> inadequacy becomes clear in the gloomy
abode of miscellaneous bones. My midnight vigils were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> of a
different <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> from the scholar's.

The week of final examinations at the Hindu <span class="t23 hoverable">High</span> School was fast
approaching. This interrogatory period, like the sepulchral haunts,
inspires a well-known terror. My <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> was nevertheless at peace.
Braving the ghouls, I was exhuming a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> not found in lecture
halls. But it lacked the <span class="t2 t6 t8 t9 t10 t15 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">art</span> of Swami Pranabananda, who easily
appeared in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> places at one time. My educational dilemma was
plainly a <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> for the Infinite Ingenuity. This was my reasoning,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> to many it seems illogic. The devotee's irrationality springs
from a <span class="t15 t23 hoverable">thousand</span> inexplicable demonstrations of God's instancy in
trouble.

"Hello, Mukunda! I catch hardly a glimpse of you these days!" A
classmate accosted me one afternoon on Gurpar Road.

"Hello, Nantu! My invisibility at school has actually placed me
there in a decidedly awkward position." I unburdened myself under
his friendly gaze.

Nantu, who was a brilliant student, laughed heartily; my predicament
was not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> a comic aspect.

"You are utterly unprepared for the finals! I suppose it is up to
me to help you!"

The simple <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> conveyed <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> promise to my ears; with alacrity
I visited my friend's home. He kindly outlined the solutions to
various problems he considered likely to be <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> by the instructors.

"These questions are the bait which will catch many trusting boys
in the examination trap. Remember my answers, and you will escape
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> injury."

The night was far gone when I departed. Bursting with unseasoned
erudition, I devoutly prayed it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> remain for the next few
critical days. Nantu had coached me in my various subjects but,
under press of time, had forgotten my course in Sanskrit. Fervently
I reminded <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> of the oversight.

I <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> out on a short walk the next morning, assimilating my new
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> to the rhythm of swinging footsteps. As I <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> a short
cut through the weeds of a corner lot, my eye fell on a few loose
printed sheets. A triumphant pounce proved them to be Sanskrit verse.
I sought out a pundit for aid in my stumbling interpretation. His
rich <span class="t23 hoverable">voice</span> filled the air with the edgeless, honeyed beauty of the
ancient tongue. {FN10-1}

"These exceptional stanzas cannot possibly be of aid in your Sanskrit
test." The scholar dismissed them skeptically.

But familiarity with that particular poem enabled me on the following
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> to <span class="t6 t9 t13 t15 t17 t18 t23 t28 t29 hoverable">pass</span> the Sanskrit examination. Through the discerning help
Nantu had given, I also attained the minimum grade for success in
all my other subjects.

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Father</span> was pleased that I had kept my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> and concluded my secondary
school course. My gratitude sped to the Lord, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> sole guidance
I perceived in my visit to Nantu and my walk by the unhabitual route
of the debris-filled lot. Playfully He had given a dual expression
to His timely design for my rescue.

I came across the discarded <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">book</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> author had denied <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span>
precedence in the examination halls. I could not restrain a chuckle
at my own silent comment:

"It <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> only add to this fellow's confusion, if I were to tell
him that <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> among the cadavers is a short cut to a
<span class="t23 hoverable">high</span> school diploma!"

In my new dignity, I was now openly planning to leave home. <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Together</span>
with a young friend, Jitendra Mazumdar, {FN10-2} I decided to join a
Mahamandal hermitage in Benares, and receive its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> discipline.

A desolation fell over me one morning at <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> of separation from
my family. Since Mother's death, my affection had grown especially

tender for my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> younger brothers, Sananda and Bishnu. I rushed
to my retreat, the little attic which had witnessed so many scenes
in my turbulent SADHANA. {FN10-3} After a two-hour flood of tears,
I felt singularly transformed, as by some alchemical cleanser. All
attachment {FN10-4} disappeared; my resolution to seek <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> as the
Friend of friends <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> like granite <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> me. I quickly completed
my travel preparations.

"I make one last plea." <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Father</span> was distressed as I stood before him
for final blessing. "Do not forsake me and your grieving brothers
and sisters."

"Revered Father, how can I tell my <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t8 t13 t15 t17 t18 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> for you! But even greater
is my <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t8 t13 t15 t17 t18 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> for the Heavenly Father, who has given me the gift of
a perfect <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">father</span> on earth. Let me go, that I someday return with
a more <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> understanding."

With reluctant parental consent, I <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> out to join Jitendra, already
in Benares at the hermitage. On my arrival the young <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> swami,
Dyananda, greeted me cordially. Tall and thin, of thoughtful mien,
he impressed me favorably. His fair face had a Buddhalike composure.

I was pleased that my new home possessed an attic, where I managed
to spend the dawn and morning hours. The ashram members, knowing
little of <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> practices, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> I should employ my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span>

time in organizational duties. They gave me praise for my afternoon
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> in their office.

"Don't try to catch <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> so soon!" This ridicule from a fellow
resident accompanied one of my early departures toward the attic. I
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> to Dyananda, busy in his small sanctum overlooking the Ganges.

"Swamiji, {FN10-5} I don't understand what is required of me here.
I am seeking direct perception of God. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Without</span> Him, I cannot be
satisfied with affiliation or creed or performance of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> works."

The orange-robed ecclesiastic gave me an affectionate pat. Staging
a mock rebuke, he admonished a few near-by disciples. "Don't bother
Mukunda. He will learn our ways."

I politely concealed my doubt. The students <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> the room, not overly
bent with their chastisement. Dyananda had further <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> for me.

"Mukunda, I see your <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">father</span> is regularly sending you money. Please
return it to him; you require none here. A <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> injunction for
your discipline concerns food. Even when you feel hunger, don't
mention it."

<span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">Whether</span> famishment gleamed in my eye, I knew not. That I was hungry,
I knew only too well. The invariable hour for the first hermitage

meal was twelve noon. I had been accustomed in my own home to a
large breakfast at nine o'clock.

The three-hour gap became daily more interminable. Gone were the
Calcutta <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> when I could rebuke the cook for a ten-minute delay.
Now I tried to control my appetite; one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> I undertook a twenty-four
hour fast. With double zest I awaited the following midday.

"Dyanandaji's train is late; we are not going to <span class="t28 hoverable">eat</span> until he
arrives." Jitendra <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> me this devastating news. As gesture
of welcome to the swami, who had been absent for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> weeks, many
delicacies were in readiness. An appetizing aroma filled the air.
Nothing else offering, what else could be swallowed except pride
over yesterday's achievement of a fast?

"Lord hasten the train!" The Heavenly Provider, I thought, was hardly
included in the interdiction with which Dyananda had silenced me.
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Attention was elsewhere, however; the plodding clock covered
the hours. Darkness was descending as our leader entered the door.
My greeting was one of unfeigned joy.

"Dyanandaji will bathe and meditate before we can serve food."
Jitendra approached me again as a bird of ill omen.

I was in near-collapse. My young stomach, new to deprivation,

protested with gnawing vigor. Pictures I had seen of famine victims
passed wraithlike before me.

"The next Benares <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">death</span> from starvation is due at once in this
hermitage," I thought. Impending doom averted at nine o'clock.
Ambrosial summons! In memory that meal is vivid as one of life's
perfect hours.

Intense absorption <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> permitted me to observe that Dyananda ate
absent-mindedly. He was apparently above my gross pleasures.

"Swamiji, weren't you hungry?" Happily surfeited, I was alone with
the leader in his study.

"O yes! I have spent the last four <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">days</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> or drink.
I never <span class="t28 hoverable">eat</span> on trains, filled with the heterogenous vibrations of
worldly people. Strictly I observe the SHASTRIC {FN10-6} rules for
monks of my particular order.

"Certain problems of our organizational <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> lie on my mind.
Tonight at home I neglected my dinner. What's the hurry? Tomorrow
I'll make it a point to have a proper meal." He laughed merrily.

Shame spread <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> me like a suffocation. But the past <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> of my
torture was not easily forgotten; I ventured a further remark.

"Swamiji, I am puzzled. Following your instruction, suppose I never
asked for food, and nobody gives me any. I should starve to death."

"Die then!" This alarming counsel split the air. "Die if you must
Mukunda! Never admit that you live by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> and not by
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of God! He who has <span class="t16 hoverable">created</span> every <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of nourishment, He
who has bestowed appetite, will certainly see that His devotee is
sustained! Do not imagine that rice maintains you, or that money
or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> support you! Could they aid if the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> withdraws your
life-breath? They are His indirect instruments merely. Is it by
any skill of yours that <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> digests in your stomach? <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">Use</span> the sword
of your discrimination, Mukunda! Cut through the chains of agency
and perceive the Single Cause!"

I found his incisive <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> entering some deep marrow. Gone was
an age-old delusion by which bodily imperatives outwit the soul.
There and then I tasted the Spirit's all-sufficiency. In how many
strange cities, in my later <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of ceaseless travel, did occasion
arise to prove the serviceability of this lesson in a Benares
hermitage!

The sole treasure which had accompanied me from Calcutta was the
SADHU'S silver amulet bequeathed to me by Mother. Guarding it for
years, I now had it carefully hidden in my ashram room. To renew

my joy in the talismanic testimony, one morning I opened the locked
box. The sealed covering untouched, lo! the amulet was gone.
Mournfully I tore open its envelope and made unmistakably sure. It
had vanished, in accordance with the SADHU'S prediction, into the
ether whence he had summoned it.

My relationship with Dyananda's followers grew steadily worse. The
household was alienated, hurt by my determined aloofness. My strict
adherence to <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on the very Ideal for which I had <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span>
home and all worldly ambitions <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> forth shallow criticism on
all sides.

Torn by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> anguish, I entered the attic one dawn, resolved
to pray until answer was vouchsafed.

"Merciful Mother of the Universe, teach me Thyself through visions,
or through a guru sent by Thee!"

The passing hours found my sobbing pleas <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> response. Suddenly
I felt lifted as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> bodily to a sphere uncircumscribed.

"Thy <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> cometh today!" A <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> womanly <span class="t23 hoverable">voice</span> came from everywhere
and nowhere.

This supernal experience was pierced by a shout from a definite

locale. A young priest nicknamed Habu was calling me from the
downstairs kitchen.

"Mukunda, enough of meditation! You are needed for an errand."

Another <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> I might have replied impatiently; now I wiped
my tear-swollen face and meekly obeyed the summons. <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Together</span> Habu
and I <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> out for a distant market <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> in the Bengali section of
Benares. The ungentle Indian <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> was not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> at zenith as we made
our purchases in the bazaars. We pushed our <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> through the colorful
medley of housewives, guides, priests, simply-clad widows, dignified
Brahmins, and the ubiquitous <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">holy</span> bulls. Passing an inconspicuous
lane, I turned my <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> and surveyed the narrow length.

A Christlike <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> in the ocher robes of a swami stood motionless at
the end of the road. Instantly and anciently familiar he seemed;
my gaze fed hungrily for a trice. Then doubt assailed me.

"You are confusing this wandering monk with someone known to you,"
I thought. "Dreamer, walk on."

After ten minutes, I felt heavy numbness in my feet. As <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span>
turned to stone, they were unable to carry me farther. Laboriously
I turned around; my feet regained normalcy. I faced the opposite
direction; again the curious weight oppressed me.

"The saint is magnetically drawing me to him!" With this thought,
I heaped my parcels into the arms of Habu. He had been observing
my erratic footwork with amazement, and now burst into laughter.

"What ails you? Are you crazy?"

My tumultuous emotion prevented any retort; I sped silently away.

Retracing my steps as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> wing-shod, I reached the narrow lane.
My quick glance revealed the quiet figure, steadily gazing in my
direction. A few eager steps and I was at his feet.

"Gurudeva!" {FN10-7} The <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> face was none other than he of my
<span class="t15 t23 hoverable">thousand</span> visions. These halcyon eyes, in leonine <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> with pointed
beard and flowing locks, had oft peered through gloom of my nocturnal
reveries, holding a promise I had not fully understood.

"O my own, you have come to me!" My guru uttered the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> again
and again in Bengali, his <span class="t23 hoverable">voice</span> tremulous with joy. "How many <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span>
I have waited for you!"

We entered a oneness of silence; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> seemed the rankest
superfluities. Eloquence flowed in soundless chant from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> of
<span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> to disciple. With an antenna of irrefragable insight I sensed

that my guru knew God, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> lead me to Him. The obscuration
of this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> disappeared in a fragile dawn of prenatal memories.
Dramatic time! Past, present, and future are its cycling scenes.
This was not the first <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> to <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> me at these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">holy</span> feet!

My <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> in his, my guru led me to his temporary residence in the
Rana Mahal section of the city. His athletic figure moved with firm
tread. Tall, erect, about fifty-five at this time, he was active
and vigorous as a young man. His dark <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> were large, beautiful with
plumbless wisdom. Slightly curly hair softened a face of striking
power. Strength mingled subtly with gentleness.

As we made our <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> to the stone balcony of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> overlooking the
Ganges, he said affectionately:

"I will give you my hermitages and all I possess."

"Sir, I come for <span class="t12 t20 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">wisdom</span> and God-contact. Those are your treasure-troves
I am after!"

The swift Indian twilight had dropped its half-curtain before my
<span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> spoke again. His <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> held unfathomable tenderness.

"I give you my unconditional love."

Precious words! A quarter-century elapsed before I had another
auricular proof of his love. His lips were strange to ardor; silence
became his oceanic heart.

"Will you give me the same unconditional love?" He gazed at me with
childlike trust.

"I will <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t8 t13 t15 t17 t18 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> you eternally, Gurudeva!"

"Ordinary <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t8 t13 t15 t17 t18 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> is selfish, darkly rooted in desires and satisfactions.
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t8 t13 t15 t17 t18 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> condition, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> boundary, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> change.
The flux of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> is gone forever at the transfixing touch
of pure love." He added humbly, "If ever you <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> me falling from
a <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of God-realization, please promise to put my <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> on your
lap and help to <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> me back to the Cosmic Beloved we both worship."

He rose then in the gathering darkness and guided me to an inner
room. As we ate mangoes and almond sweetmeats, he unobtrusively
wove into his conversation an intimate <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of my nature. I
was awe-struck at the grandeur of his wisdom, exquisitely blended
with an innate humility.

"Do not grieve for your amulet. It has served its purpose." Like
a <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> mirror, my guru apparently had caught a reflection of my
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> life.

"The living reality of your presence, Master, is joy beyond any
symbol."

"It is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> for a change, inasmuch as you are unhappily situated
in the hermitage."

I had made no references to my life; they now seemed superfluous!
By his natural, unemphatic manner, I understood that he wished no
astonished ejaculations at his clairvoyance.

"You should go back to Calcutta. Why exclude relatives from your
<span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t8 t13 t15 t17 t18 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> of humanity?"

His suggestion dismayed me. My family was predicting my return,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> I had been unresponsive to many pleas by letter. "Let the
young bird fly in the metaphysical skies," Ananta had remarked.
"His wings will tire in the heavy atmosphere. We shall <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> see him
swoop toward home, fold his pinions, and humbly rest in our family
nest." This discouraging simile fresh in my mind, I was determined
to do no "swooping" in the direction of Calcutta.

"Sir, I am not returning home. But I will follow you anywhere.
Please give me your address, and your name."

"Swami Sri Yukteswar Giri. My chief hermitage is in Serampore, on
Rai Ghat Lane. I am visiting my mother here for only a few days."

I wondered at God's intricate play with His devotees. Serampore is
but twelve miles from Calcutta, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> in those regions I had never
caught a glimpse of my guru. We had had to travel for our meeting
to the ancient <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">city</span> of Kasi (Benares), hallowed by memories of
Lahiri Mahasaya. Here too the feet of Buddha, Shankaracharya and
other Yogi--Christs had <span class="t11 hoverable">blessed</span> the soil.

"You will come to me in four weeks." For the first time, Sri
Yukteswar's <span class="t23 hoverable">voice</span> was stern. "Now I have told my <span class="t20 hoverable">eternal</span> affection,
and have shown my happiness at finding you-that is why you disregard
my request. The next <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> we meet, you will have to reawaken my
interest: I won't accept you as a disciple easily. There must be
complete surrender by obedience to my strict training."

I remained obstinately silent. My guru easily penetrated my
difficulty.

"Do you think your relatives will laugh at you?"

"I will not return."

"You will return in thirty days."

"Never." Bowing reverently at his feet, I departed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> lightening
the controversial tension. As I made my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> in the midnight darkness,
I wondered why the miraculous meeting had ended on an inharmonious
note. The dual scales of MAYA, that balance every joy with a grief!
My young <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> was not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> malleable to the transforming fingers
of my guru.

The next morning I noticed increased hostility in the attitude
of the hermitage members. My <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">days</span> became spiked with invariable
rudeness. In <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> weeks, Dyananda <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> the ashram to attend a
conference in Bombay; pandemonium broke over my hapless head.

"Mukunda is a parasite, accepting hermitage hospitality <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span>
making proper return." Overhearing this remark, I regretted for the
first <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> that I had obeyed the request to send back my money to
Father. With heavy heart, I sought out my sole friend, Jitendra.

"I am leaving. Please convey my respectful regrets to Dyanandaji
when he returns."

"I will leave also! My attempts to meditate here meet with no more
favor than your own." Jitendra spoke with determination.

"I have met a Christlike saint. Let us visit him in Serampore."

And so the "bird" prepared to "swoop" perilously close to Calcutta!

{FN10-1} SANSKRITA, polished; complete. Sanskrit is the eldest
sister of all Indo-European tongues. Its alphabetical script is
DEVANAGARI, literally "divine abode." "Who knows my grammar knows
God!" Panini, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> philologist of ancient India, paid this tribute
to the mathematical and psychological perfection in Sanskrit. He

{FN10-2} He was not Jatinda (Jotin Ghosh), who will be remembered
for his timely aversion to tigers!

{FN10-3} Path or preliminary road to God.

{FN10-4} Hindu scriptures teach that family attachment is delusive
if it prevents the devotee from seeking the Giver of all boons,
including the one of loving relatives, not to mention <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> itself.
<span class="t0 t6 t8 t9 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t22 t23 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Jesus</span> similarly taught: "Who is my mother? and who are my brethren?"
(MATTHEW 12:48.)

{FN10-5} JI is a customary respectful suffix, particularly <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span>
in direct address; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> "swamiji," "guruji," "Sri Yukteswarji,"

{FN10-6} Pertaining to the SHASTRAS, literally, "sacred books,"
comprising four classes of scripture: the SHRUTI, SMRITI, PURANA,
and TANTRA. These comprehensive treatises cover every aspect
of religious and social life, and the fields of law, medicine,
architecture, art, etc. The SHRUTIS are the "directly heard" or
"revealed" scriptures, the VEDAS. The SMRITIS or "remembered" lore
was finally <span class="t0 t11 t24 hoverable">written</span> down in a remote past as the world's longest
epic poems, the MAHABHARATA and the RAMAYANA. PURANAS are literally
"ancient" allegories; TANTRAS literally mean "rites" or "rituals";
these treatises convey profound truths under a veil of detailed
symbolism.

{FN10-7} "Divine teacher," the customary Sanskrit term for one's
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> preceptor. I have rendered it in English as simply
"Master."

How
foolishly you are throwing away your life!" An elder-brother sermon
was assaulting my ears.

Jitendra and I, fresh from the train (a figure of speech merely;
we were covered with dust), had just arrived at the home of Ananta,
recently transferred from Calcutta to the ancient <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">city</span> of Agra.
Brother was a supervising accountant for the Bengal-Nagpur Railway.

"You <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> know, Ananta, I seek my inheritance from the Heavenly
Father."

"Money first; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> can come later!

"God first; money is His slave! Who can tell? <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Life</span> may be too
short."

My retort was summoned by the exigencies of the moment, and held
no presentiment. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> the leaves of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> unfolded to early finality
for Ananta; a few <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> later {FN11-1} he entered the <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">land</span> where

"Wisdom from the hermitage, I suppose! But I see you have <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span>
Benares." Ananta's <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> gleamed with satisfaction; he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> hoped to
secure my pinions in the family nest.

"My sojourn in Benares was not in vain! I found there everything my

or his son!"

Ananta joined me in reminiscent laughter; he had had to admit that
the Benares "clairvoyant" he selected was a shortsighted one.

"What are your plans, my wandering brother?"

"Jitendra persuaded me to Agra. We shall <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> the beauties of the
Taj Mahal {FN11-2} here," I explained. "Then we are going to my
newly-found guru, who has a hermitage in Serampore."

Ananta hospitably arranged for our comfort. Several times during
the evening I noticed his <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> fixed on me reflectively.

"I know that look!" I thought. "A plot is brewing!"

The denouement <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> during our early breakfast.

"So you feel quite independent of Father's wealth." Ananta's gaze
was innocent as he resumed the barbs of yesterday's conversation.

"I am conscious of my dependence on God."

"Words are cheap! <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Life</span> has shielded you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> far! What a plight
if you were forced to look to the Invisible <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Hand</span> for your <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> and

"Never! I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> not put <span class="t4 t7 t12 t16 hoverable">faith</span> in passers-by rather than God! He can
devise for His devotee a <span class="t15 t23 hoverable">thousand</span> resources besides the begging-bowl!"

"More rhetoric! Suppose I suggest that your vaunted philosophy be
put to a test in this tangible world?"

"I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> agree!

"We shall see; today you shall have opportunity either to enlarge
or to confirm my own views!" Ananta paused for a dramatic moment;
then spoke slowly and seriously.

"I propose that I send you and your fellow disciple Jitendra this
morning to the near-by <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">city</span> of Brindaban.

not reveal your predicament to anyone; you must not go <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> your

to my bungalow here before twelve o'clock tonight, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> having

Agra!"

"I accept the challenge." No hesitation was in my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> or in

my heart. Grateful memories flashed of the Instant Beneficence:
my healing of deadly cholera through appeal to Lahiri Mahasaya's
picture; the playful gift of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> kites on the Lahore roof with
Uma; the opportune amulet amidst my discouragement; the decisive
message through the unknown Benares SADHU outside the compound of
the pundit's home; the vision of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Mother and Her majestic
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> of love; Her swift heed through <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> Mahasaya to my trifling
embarrassments; the last-minute guidance which materialized my
<span class="t23 hoverable">high</span> school diploma; and the ultimate boon, my living <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> from
the mist of lifelong dreams. Never could I admit my "philosophy"
unequal to any tussle on the world's harsh proving ground!

"Your willingness does you credit. I'll escort you to the train
at once." Ananta turned to the openmouthed Jitendra. "You must go
along as a witness and, very likely, a fellow victim!"

A half hour later Jitendra and I were in possession of one-way
tickets for our impromptu trip. We submitted, in a secluded corner
of the station, to a search of our persons. Ananta was quickly
satisfied that we were carrying no hidden hoard; our simple DHOTIS
{FN11-3} concealed nothing more than was necessary.

As <span class="t4 t7 t12 t16 hoverable">faith</span> invaded the serious realms of finance, my friend spoke
protestingly. "Ananta, give me one or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> rupees as a safeguard.
Then I can telegraph you in <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of misfortune."

"Jitendra!" My ejaculation was sharply reproachful. "I will not
proceed with the test if you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> any money as final security."

"There is something reassuring about the clink of coins." Jitendra
said no more as I regarded him sternly.

"Mukunda, I am not heartless." A hint of humility had crept into
Ananta's voice. It may be that his conscience was smiting him;
perhaps for sending <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> insolvent boys to a strange city; perhaps
for his own religious skepticism. "If by any chance or grace you
<span class="t6 t9 t13 t15 t17 t18 t23 t28 t29 hoverable">pass</span> successfully through the Brindaban ordeal, I shall ask you to
initiate me as your disciple."

This promise had a certain irregularity, in keeping with the
unconventional occasion. The eldest brother in an Indian family
seldom bows before his juniors; he receives respect and obedience
<span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> only to a father. But no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> remained for my comment; our
train was at point of departure.

Jitendra maintained a lugubrious silence as our train covered the
miles. Finally he bestirred himself; leaning over, he pinched me
painfully at an awkward spot.

"I see no sign that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> is going to supply our next meal!"

"Be quiet, doubting Thomas; the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> is working with us."

"Can you also arrange that He hurry? Already I am famished merely
at the prospect before us. I <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> Benares to <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> the Taj's mausoleum,
not to enter my own!"

"Cheer up, Jitendra! Are we not to have our first glimpse of the
sacred wonders of Brindaban? {FN11-4} I am in deep joy at <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span>
of treading the ground hallowed by feet of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> Krishna."

The door of our compartment opened; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> seated themselves. The
next train stop <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be the last.

"Young lads, do you have friends in Brindaban?" The stranger opposite
me was taking a surprising interest.

"None of your business!" Rudely I averted my gaze.

"You are probably flying away from your families under the enchantment
of the Stealer of Hearts. {FN11-5} I am of devotional temperament
myself. I will make it my positive duty to see that you receive
food, and shelter from this overpowering heat."

"No, sir, let us alone. You are very kind; but you are mistaken in

judging us to be truants from home."

No further conversation ensued; the train came to a halt. As Jitendra
and I descended to the platform, our chance companions linked arms
with us and summoned a horse cab.

We alit before a stately hermitage, <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> amidst the evergreen trees
of well-kept grounds. Our benefactors were evidently known here; a
smiling lad led us <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> comment to a parlor. We were soon joined
by an elderly woman of dignified bearing.

"Gauri Ma, the princes could not come." One of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> addressed
the ashram hostess. "At the last moment their plans <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> awry; they
send deep regrets. But we have <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> other guests. As soon
as we met on the train, I felt drawn to them as devotees of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span>
Krishna."

"Good-by, young friends." Our <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> acquaintances walked to the door.
"We shall meet again, if <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> be willing."

"You are welcome here." Gauri Ma smiled in motherly fashion on her
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> unexpected charges. "You could not have come on a better day.
I was expecting <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> royal patrons of this hermitage. What a shame
if my cooking had found none to appreciate it!"

These appetizing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> had disastrous effect on Jitendra: he burst
into tears. The "prospect" he had feared in Brindaban was turning
out as royal entertainment; his sudden mental adjustment proved
too much for him. Our hostess looked at him with curiosity, but
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> remark; perhaps she was familiar with adolescent quirks.

Lunch was announced; Gauri Ma led the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> to a dining patio, spicy
with savory odors. She vanished into an adjoining kitchen.

I had been premeditating this moment. Selecting the appropriate
spot on Jitendra's anatomy, I administered a pinch as resounding
as the one he had given me on the train.

"Doubting Thomas, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> works-in a hurry, too!"

The hostess reentered with a PUNKHA. She steadily fanned us in the
Oriental fashion as we squatted on ornate blanket-seats. Ashram
disciples passed to and fro with some thirty courses. Rather than
"meal," the description can only be "sumptuous repast." Since
arriving on this planet, Jitendra and I had never before tasted
such delicacies.

"Dishes fit for princes indeed, Honored Mother! What your royal
patrons could have found more urgent than attending this banquet,
I cannot imagine! You have given us a memory for a lifetime!"

Silenced as we were by Ananta's requirement, we could not explain
to the gracious lady that our thanks held a double significance.
Our sincerity at least was patent. We departed with her blessing
and an attractive invitation to revisit the hermitage.

The heat outdoors was merciless. My friend and I made for the
shelter of a lordly cadamba tree at the ashram gate. Sharp <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span>
followed; once again Jitendra was beset with misgivings.

"A fine mess you have got me into! Our luncheon was only accidental
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> fortune! How can we see the sights of this city, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> a

single pice between us? And how on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> are you going to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> me
back to Ananta's?"

"You forget <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> quickly, now that your stomach is filled." My words,
not bitter, were accusatory. How short is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> memory for <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span>
favors! No <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> lives who has not seen certain of his prayers granted.

"I am not likely to forget my folly in venturing out with a madcap
like you!"

"Be quiet, Jitendra! The same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> who fed us will show us Brindaban,
and return us to Agra."

A slight young <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> of pleasing countenance approached at rapid
pace. Halting under our tree, he bowed before me.

"Dear friend, you and your companion must be strangers here. Permit
me to be your host and guide."

It is scarcely possible for an Indian to pale, but Jitendra's face
was suddenly sickly. I politely declined the offer.

"You are surely not banishing me?" The stranger's alarm <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have
been comic in any other circumstances.

"Why not?"

"You are my guru." His <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> sought mine trustfully. "During my
midday devotions, the <span class="t11 hoverable">blessed</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> Krishna appeared in a vision.
He showed me <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> forsaken figures under this very tree. One face
was yours, my master! Often have I seen it in meditation! What joy
if you accept my humble services!"

"I too am glad you have found me.

an inward obeisance cast me at the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Feet.

"Dear friends, will you not honor my home for a visit?"

"You are kind; but the plan is unfeasible. Already we are guests
of my brother in Agra."

"At least give me memories of touring Brindaban with you."

I gladly consented. The young man, who said his name was Pratap
Chatterji, hailed a horse carriage. We visited Madanamohana Temple
and other Krishna shrines. Night descended while we were at our
temple devotions.

"Excuse me while I get SANDESH." {FN11-6} Pratap entered a shop

near the railroad station. Jitendra and I sauntered along the
wide street, crowded now in the comparative coolness. Our friend
was absent for some time, but finally returned with gifts of many
sweetmeats.

"Please allow me to gain this religious merit." Pratap smiled
pleadingly as he held out a bundle of rupee notes and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> tickets,
just purchased, to Agra.

The reverence of my acceptance was for the Invisible Hand. Scoffed
at by Ananta, had Its bounty not far exceeded necessity?

We sought out a secluded spot near the station.

"Pratap, I will instruct you in the KRIYA of Lahiri Mahasaya, the
greatest yogi of modern times. His technique will be your guru."

The initiation was concluded in a half hour. "KRIYA is your CHINTAMANI,"
{FN11-7} I told the new student. "The technique, which as you see
is simple, embodies the <span class="t2 t6 t8 t9 t10 t15 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">art</span> of quickening man's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> evolution.
Hindu scriptures teach that the incarnating ego requires a million
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> to obtain liberation from MAYA. This natural period is
greatly shortened through KRIYA YOGA. Just as Jagadis Chandra Bose
has demonstrated that plant growth can be accelerated far beyond
its normal rate, so man's psychological development can be also

speeded by an inner science. Be faithful in your practice; you will
approach the Guru of all gurus."

"I am transported to <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> this yogic key, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> sought!" Pratap
spoke thoughtfully. "Its unshackling effect on my sensory bonds
will <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> me for <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> spheres. The vision today of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> Krishna
could only mean my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> good."

We sat awhile in silent understanding, then walked slowly to the
station. Joy was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> me as I boarded the train, but this was
Jitendra's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> for tears. My affectionate farewell to Pratap had
been punctuated by stifled sobs from both my companions. The journey
once more found Jitendra in a welter of grief. Not for himself this
time, but against himself.

"How shallow my trust! My <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> has been stone! Never in future
shall I doubt God's protection!"

Midnight was approaching. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> "Cinderellas," sent forth
penniless, entered Ananta's bedroom. His face, as he had promised,
was a study in astonishment. Silently I showered the table with
rupees.

"Jitendra, the truth!" Ananta's tone was jocular. "Has not this
youngster been staging a holdup?"

But as the tale was unfolded, my brother turned sober, then solemn.

"The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">law</span> of demand and supply reaches into subtler realms than I
had supposed." Ananta spoke with a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> enthusiasm never before
noticeable. "I understand for the first <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> your indifference to
the vaults and vulgar accumulations of the world."

Late as it was, my brother insisted that he receive DIKSHA {FN11-8}
into KRIYA YOGA. The "guru" Mukunda had to shoulder the responsibility
of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> unsought disciples in one day.

Breakfast the following morning was eaten in a harmony absent the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> before. I smiled at Jitendra.

"You shall not be cheated of the Taj. Let us <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> it before starting
for Serampore."

Bidding farewell to Ananta, my friend and I were soon before the
<span class="t0 t7 t21 t27 hoverable">glory</span> of Agra, the Taj Mahal. White marble dazzling in the sun,
it stands a vision of pure symmetry. The perfect setting is dark
cypress, glossy lawn, and tranquil lagoon. The interior is exquisite
with lacelike carvings inlaid with semiprecious stones. Delicate
wreaths and scrolls emerge intricately from marbles, brown and
violet. Illumination from the dome falls on the cenotaphs of Emperor

Shah-Jahan and Mumtaz Mahall, queen of his realm and his heart.

Enough of sight-seeing! I was longing for my guru. Jitendra and I
were shortly traveling south by train toward Bengal.

"Mukunda, I have not seen my family in months. I have changed my
mind; perhaps later I shall visit your <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> in Serampore."

My friend, who may mildly be described as vacillating in temperament,
<span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> me in Calcutta. By local train I soon reached Serampore, twelve
miles to the north.

A throb of wonderment stole over me as I realized that twenty-eight
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">days</span> had elapsed since the Benares meeting with my guru. "You will
come to me in four weeks!" Here I was, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> pounding, standing
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> his courtyard on quiet Rai Ghat Lane. I entered for the first
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> the hermitage where I was to spend the best part of the next

CHAPTER: 12

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">YEARS</span> IN MY MASTER'S HERMITAGE

"You have come." Sri Yukteswar greeted me from a tiger skin on the
floor of a balconied sitting room. His <span class="t23 hoverable">voice</span> was cold, his manner
unemotional.

"Yes, dear Master, I am here to follow you." Kneeling, I touched
his feet.

"How can that be? You ignore my wishes."

"No longer, Guruji! Your wish shall be my law!"

"That is better! Now I can assume responsibility for your life."

"I willingly transfer the burden, Master."

"My first request, then, is that you return home to your family.
I want you to enter college in Calcutta. Your education should be
continued."

"Very well, sir." I hid my consternation. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Would</span> importunate books
pursue me down the years? First Father, now Sri Yukteswar!

"Someday you will go to the West. Its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> will lend ears more
receptive to India's ancient <span class="t12 t20 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">wisdom</span> if the strange Hindu teacher
has a university degree."

"You know best, Guruji." My gloom departed. The reference to the
West I found puzzling, remote; but my opportunity to please <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span>

by obedience was vitally immediate.

"You will be near in Calcutta; come here whenever you <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> time."

"Every <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> if possible, Master! Gratefully I accept your authority
in every detail of my life-on one condition."

"Yes?"

"That you promise to reveal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> to me!"

An hour-long verbal tussle ensued. A master's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> cannot be
falsified; it is not lightly given. The implications in the pledge
open out vast metaphysical vistas. A guru must be on intimate
terms indeed with the Creator before he can obligate Him to appear!
I sensed Sri Yukteswar's <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> unity, and was determined, as his
disciple, to press my advantage.

"You are of exacting disposition!" Then Master's consent rang out
with compassionate finality:

"Let your wish be my wish."

Lifelong shadow lifted from my heart; the vague search, hither and
yon, was over. I had found <span class="t20 hoverable">eternal</span> shelter in a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> guru.

"Come; I will show you the hermitage." <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> rose from his tiger
mat. I glanced about me; my gaze fell with astonishment on a wall
picture, garlanded with a spray of jasmine.

"Lahiri Mahasaya!"

"Yes, my <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> guru." Sri Yukteswar's tone was reverently vibrant.
"Greater he was, as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> and yogi, than any other teacher <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span>
came <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the range of my investigations."

Silently I bowed before the familiar picture. Soul-homage sped to
the peerless <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> who, blessing my infancy, had guided my steps
to this hour.

Led by my guru, I strolled over the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> and its grounds.
Large, ancient and well-built, the hermitage was surrounded by a
massive-pillared courtyard. Outer walls were moss-covered; pigeons
fluttered over the flat gray roof, unceremoniously sharing the
ashram quarters. A rear garden was pleasant with jackfruit, mango,
and plantain trees. Balustraded balconies of upper rooms in the
two-storied building faced the courtyard from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> sides. A spacious
ground-floor hall, with <span class="t23 hoverable">high</span> ceiling supported by colonnades, was
used, <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> said, chiefly during the annual festivities of DURGAPUJA.
{FN12-1} A narrow stairway led to Sri Yukteswar's sitting room,

whose small balcony overlooked the street. The ashram was plainly
furnished; everything was simple, clean, and utilitarian. Several
Western styled chairs, benches, and tables were in evidence.

<span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> invited me to stay overnight. A supper of vegetable curry was
served by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> young disciples who were receiving hermitage training.

"Guruji, please tell me something of your life." I was squatting
on a straw mat near his tiger skin. The friendly stars were very
close, it seemed, beyond the balcony.

"My family name was Priya Nath Karar. I was <span class="t16 t24 hoverable">born</span> {FN12-2} here
in Serampore, where <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Father</span> was a wealthy businessman. He <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> me
this ancestral mansion, now my hermitage. My formal schooling was
little; I found it slow and shallow. In early manhood, I undertook
the responsibilities of a householder, and have one daughter, now
married. My middle <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> was <span class="t11 hoverable">blessed</span> with the guidance of Lahiri
Mahasaya. After my wife died, I joined the Swami <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Order</span> and received
the new name of Sri Yukteswar Giri. {FN12-3} Such are my simple
annals."

<span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> smiled at my eager face. Like all biographical sketches,
his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> had given the outward facts <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> revealing the inner
man.

"Guruji, I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> like to hear some stories of your childhood."

"I will tell you a few-each one with a moral!" Sri Yukteswar's
<span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> twinkled with his warning. "My mother once tried to frighten
me with an appalling story of a ghost in a dark chamber. I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span>
there immediately, and expressed my disappointment at having missed
the ghost. Mother never told me another horror-tale. Moral: Look
<span class="t28 hoverable">fear</span> in the face and it will cease to trouble you.

"Another early memory is my wish for an ugly dog belonging to
a neighbor. I kept my household in turmoil for weeks to get that
dog. My ears were deaf to offers of pets with more prepossessing
appearance. Moral: Attachment is blinding; it lends an imaginary
halo of attractiveness to the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of desire.

"A <span class="t7 hoverable">third</span> story concerns the plasticity of the youthful mind. I
<span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> my mother remark occasionally: 'A <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> who accepts a job under
anyone is a slave.' That impression became so indelibly fixed that
even after my marriage I refused all positions. I met expenses by
investing my family endowment in land. Moral: <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Good</span> and positive
suggestions should instruct the sensitive ears of children. Their
early ideas <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> remain sharply etched."

<span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> fell into tranquil silence. Around midnight he led me to
a narrow cot. Sleep was sound and sweet the first night under my

guru's roof.

Sri Yukteswar chose the following morning to grant me his KRIYA YOGA
initiation. The technique I had already received from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> disciples
of Lahiri Mahasaya-Father and my tutor, Swami Kebalananda-but in
Master's presence I felt transforming power. At his touch, a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> broke <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> my being, like <span class="t0 t7 t21 t27 hoverable">glory</span> of countless suns blazing
together. A flood of ineffable bliss, overwhelming my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> to an
innermost core, continued during the following day. It was late
that afternoon before I could <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> myself to leave the hermitage.

"You will return in thirty days." As I reached my Calcutta home,
the fulfillment of Master's prediction entered with me. None of my
relatives made the pointed remarks I had feared about the reappearance
of the "soaring bird."

I climbed to my little attic and bestowed affectionate glances,
as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> on a living presence. "You have witnessed my meditations,
and the tears and storms of my SADHANA. Now I have reached the
harbor of my <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> teacher."

"Son, I am happy for us both." <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Father</span> and I sat <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> in the
evening calm. "You have found your guru, as in miraculous fashion
I once found my own. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">holy</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> of Lahiri Mahasaya is guarding
our lives. Your <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> has proved no inaccessible Himalayan saint,

but one near-by. My prayers have been answered: you have not in
your search for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> been permanently removed from my sight."

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Father</span> was also pleased that my formal studies <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be resumed;
he made suitable arrangements. I was enrolled the following <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> at
the Scottish Church College in Calcutta.

Happy months sped by. My readers have doubtless made the perspicacious
surmise that I was little seen in the college classrooms. The
Serampore hermitage held a lure too irresistible. <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> accepted
my ubiquitous presence <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> comment. To my relief, he seldom
referred to the halls of learning. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Though</span> it was plain to all that
I was never cut out for a scholar, I managed to attain minimum
passing grades from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> to time.

Daily <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> at the ashram flowed smoothly, infrequently varied. My
guru awoke before dawn. Lying down, or sometimes sitting on the bed,
he entered a <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of SAMADHI. {FN12-4} It was simplicity itself
to discover when <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> had awakened: abrupt halt of stupendous
snores. {FN12-5} A sigh or two; perhaps a bodily movement. Then a
soundless <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of breathlessness: he was in deep yogic joy.

Breakfast did not follow; first came a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> walk by the Ganges.
Those morning strolls with my guru-how real and vivid still! In
the easy resurrection of memory, I often <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> myself by his side:

the early <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> is warming the river. His <span class="t23 hoverable">voice</span> rings out, rich with
the authenticity of wisdom.

A bath; then the midday meal. Its preparation, according to Master's
daily directions, had been the careful task of young disciples. My
guru was a vegetarian. Before embracing monkhood, however, he had
eaten eggs and fish. His advice to students was to follow any simple
diet which proved suited to one's constitution.

<span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> ate little; often rice, colored with turmeric or juice of
beets or spinach and lightly sprinkled with buffalo GHEE or melted
butter. Another <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> he might have lentil-DHAL or CHANNA {FN12-6}
curry with vegetables. For dessert, mangoes or oranges with rice
pudding, or jackfruit juice.

Visitors appeared in the afternoons. A steady stream poured from
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> into the hermitage tranquillity. Everyone found in <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span>
an equal courtesy and kindness. To a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> who has realized himself
as a soul, not the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> or the ego, the rest of humanity assumes
a striking similarity of aspect.

The impartiality of saints is rooted in wisdom. Masters have escaped
MAYA; its alternating faces of intellect and idiocy no longer cast
an influential glance. Sri Yukteswar showed no special consideration
to those who happened to be powerful or accomplished; neither did

he slight others for their poverty or illiteracy. He <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> listen
respectfully to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> of <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> from a child, and openly ignore a
conceited pundit.

[Illustration: My Master, Sri Yukteswar, Disciple of Lahiri
Mahasaya--see yukteswar.jpg]

Eight o'clock was the supper hour, and sometimes found lingering
guests. My guru <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> not excuse himself to <span class="t28 hoverable">eat</span> alone; none <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> his
ashram hungry or dissatisfied. Sri Yukteswar was never at a loss,
never dismayed by unexpected visitors; scanty <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> emerge
a banquet under his resourceful direction. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> he was economical;
his modest funds <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> far. "Be comfortable <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> your purse,"
he often said. "Extravagance will buy you discomfort." <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">Whether</span> in
the details of hermitage entertainment, or his building and repair
work, or other practical concerns, <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> manifested the originality
of a creative spirit.

Quiet evening hours often <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> one of my guru's discourses,
treasures against time. His every utterance was measured and chiseled
by wisdom. A sublime self-assurance marked his mode of expression:
it was unique. He spoke as none other in my experience ever spoke.
His thoughts were weighed in a delicate balance of discrimination
before he permitted them an outward garb. The essence of truth,
all-pervasive with even a physiological aspect, came from him like

a fragrant exudation of the soul. I was conscious always that I
was in the presence of a living manifestation of God. The weight
of his divinity automatically bowed my <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> before him.

If late guests detected that Sri Yukteswar was becoming engrossed
with the Infinite, he quickly engaged them in conversation. He was
incapable of striking a pose, or of flaunting his inner withdrawal.
Always one with the Lord, he needed no separate <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> for communion.
A self-realized <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> has already <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> behind the stepping stone
of meditation. "The flower falls when the fruit appears." But saints
often cling to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> forms for the encouragement of disciples.

As midnight approached, my guru might fall into a doze with the
naturalness of a child. There was no fuss about bedding. He often
lay down, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> even a pillow, on a narrow davenport which was
the background for his customary tiger-skin seat.

A night-long philosophical discussion was not rare; any disciple
could summon it by intensity of interest. I felt no tiredness then,
no <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> for sleep; Master's living <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> were sufficient. "Oh,
it is dawn! Let us walk by the Ganges." So ended many of my periods
of nocturnal edification.

My early months with Sri Yukteswar culminated in a useful lesson-"How
to Outwit a Mosquito." At home my family always <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> protective

curtains at night. I was dismayed to discover that in the Serampore
hermitage this prudent custom was honored in the breach. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> the
insects were in <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span> residency; I was bitten from <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> to foot. My
guru <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> pity on me.

"Buy yourself a curtain, and also one for me." He laughed and added,
"If you buy only one, for yourself, all mosquitoes will concentrate
on me!"

I was more than thankful to comply. Every night that I spent in
Serampore, my guru <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> ask me to arrange the bedtime curtains.

The mosquitoes one evening were especially virulent. But <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span>
failed to issue his usual instructions. I listened nervously to
the anticipatory hum of the insects. Getting into bed, I threw a
propitiatory prayer in their general direction. A half hour later,
I coughed pretentiously to attract my guru's attention. I <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span>
I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> go mad with the bites and especially the singing drone as
the mosquitoes celebrated bloodthirsty rites.

No responsive stir from Master; I approached him cautiously. He was
not breathing. This was my first observation of him in the yogic
trance; it filled me with fright.

"His <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> must have failed!" I placed a mirror under his nose;

no breath-vapor appeared. To make doubly certain, for minutes I
closed his mouth and nostrils with my fingers. His <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> was cold
and motionless. In a daze, I turned toward the door to summon help.

"So! A budding experimentalist! My poor nose!" Master's <span class="t23 hoverable">voice</span> was
shaky with laughter. "Why don't you go to bed? Is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span>
going to change for you? Change yourself: be rid of the mosquito
consciousness."

Meekly I returned to my bed. Not one insect ventured near. I realized
that my guru had previously agreed to the curtains only to please
me; he had no <span class="t28 hoverable">fear</span> of mosquitoes. His yogic <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> was such that
he either could will them not to bite, or could escape to an inner
invulnerability.

"He was giving me a demonstration," I thought. "That is the yogic
<span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> I must strive to attain." A yogi must be able to <span class="t6 t9 t13 t15 t17 t18 t23 t28 t29 hoverable">pass</span> into,
and continue in, the superconsciousness, regardless of multitudinous
distractions never absent from this earth. <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">Whether</span> in the buzz of
insects or the pervasive glare of daylight, the testimony of the
senses must be barred. Sound and sight come then indeed, but to
worlds fairer than the banished Eden. {FN12-7}

The instructive mosquitoes served for another early lesson at the
ashram. It was the gentle hour of dusk. My guru was matchlessly

interpreting the ancient texts. At his feet, I was in perfect peace.
A rude mosquito entered the idyl and competed for my attention. As
it dug a poisonous hypodermic needle into my thigh, I automatically
raised an avenging hand. Reprieve from impending execution! An
opportune memory came to me of one of Patanjali's yoga aphorisms-that
on AHIMSA (harmlessness).

"Why didn't you finish the job?"

"Master! Do you advocate taking life?"

"No; but the deathblow already had been struck in your mind."

"I don't understand."

"Patanjali's <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> was the removal of <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">DESIRE</span> to kill." Sri
Yukteswar had found my mental processes an open book. "This <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span>
is inconveniently arranged for a literal practice of AHIMSA. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Man</span>
may be compelled to exterminate harmful creatures. He is not under
similar compulsion to feel anger or animosity. All forms of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span>
have equal right to the air of MAYA. The saint who uncovers the
secret of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span> will be in harmony with its countless bewildering
expressions. All <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> may approach that understanding who curb the
inner passion for destruction."

"Guruji, should one offer himself a <span class="t2 t9 t10 t16 t18 t19 t27 t28 hoverable">sacrifice</span> rather than kill a
wild beast?"

"No; man's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> is precious. It has the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> evolutionary
value because of unique brain and spinal centers. These enable the
advanced devotee to fully grasp and express the loftiest aspects
of divinity. No lower <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> is so equipped. It is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> that one
incurs the debt of a minor <span class="t0 t9 t11 t14 t17 t28 hoverable">sin</span> if he is forced to kill an animal or
any living thing. But the VEDAS teach that wanton loss of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span>

I sighed in relief; scriptural reinforcement of one's natural
instincts is not always forthcoming.

It so happened that I never saw <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> at close quarters with a
leopard or a tiger. But a deadly cobra once confronted him, only
to be conquered by my guru's love. This variety of snake is much
feared in India, where it causes more than five <span class="t15 t23 hoverable">thousand</span> deaths
annually. The dangerous encounter <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> at Puri, where Sri
Yukteswar had a <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> hermitage, charmingly situated near the Bay
of Bengal. Prafulla, a young disciple of later years, was with
<span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> on this occasion.

"We were seated outdoors near the ashram," Prafulla told me. "A
cobra appeared near-by, a four-foot length of sheer terror. Its

hood was angrily expanded as it raced toward us. My guru gave a
welcoming chuckle, as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> to a child. I was beside myself with
consternation to see <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> engage in a rhythmical clapping of
hands. {FN12-8} He was entertaining the dread visitor! I remained
absolutely quiet, inwardly ejaculating what fervent prayers I could
muster. The serpent, very close to my guru, was now motionless,
seemingly magnetized by his caressing attitude. The frightful hood
gradually contracted; the snake slithered between Master's feet
and disappeared into the bushes.

"Why my guru <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> move his hands, and why the cobra <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> not
strike them, were inexplicable to me then," Prafulla concluded. "I
have since come to realize that my <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> is beyond <span class="t28 hoverable">fear</span> of
hurt from any living creature."

One afternoon during my early months at the ashram, found Sri
Yukteswar's <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> fixed on me piercingly.

"You are too thin, Mukunda."

His remark struck a sensitive point. That my sunken <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> and
emaciated appearance were far from my liking was testified to by
rows of tonics in my room at Calcutta. Nothing availed; chronic
dyspepsia had pursued me since childhood. My despair reached an
occasional zenith when I asked myself if it were worth-while to

carry on this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> with a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> so unsound.

"Medicines have limitations; the creative life-force has none.
Believe that: you shall be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> and strong."

Sri Yukteswar's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> aroused a conviction of personally-applicable

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Day</span> by day, behold! I waxed. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Two</span> weeks after Master's hidden
blessing, I had accumulated the invigorating weight which eluded
me in the past. My persistent stomach ailments vanished with
a lifelong permanency. On later occasions I witnessed my guru's
instantaneous <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> healings of persons suffering from ominous
disease-tuberculosis, diabetes, epilepsy, or paralysis. Not one
could have been more grateful for his cure than I was at sudden
freedom from my cadaverous aspect.

"Years ago, I too was anxious to put on weight," Sri Yukteswar told
me. "During convalescence after a severe illness, I visited Lahiri
Mahasaya in Benares.

"'Sir, I have been very sick and lost many pounds.'

"'I see, Yukteswar, {FN12-9} you made yourself unwell, and now you

think you are thin.'

"This reply was far from the one I had expected; my guru, however,
added encouragingly:

"'Let me see; I am sure you ought to feel better tomorrow.'

"Taking his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> as a gesture of secret healing toward my receptive
mind, I was not surprised the next morning at a welcome accession
of strength. I sought out my <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> and exclaimed exultingly, 'Sir,
I feel much better today.'

"'Indeed! Today you invigorate yourself.'

"'No, master!' I protested. 'It was you who helped me; this is the
first <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> in weeks that I have had any energy.'

"'O yes! Your malady has been quite serious. Your <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> is frail
yet; who can say how it will be tomorrow?'

"The <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> of possible return of my weakness <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> me a shudder
of cold fear. The following morning I could hardly drag myself to
Lahiri Mahasaya's home.

"'Sir, I am ailing again.'

"My guru's glance was quizzical. 'So! Once more you indispose
yourself.'

"'Gurudeva, I realize now that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> you have been ridiculing
me.' My patience was exhausted. 'I don't understand why you disbelieve
my truthful reports.'

"'Really, it has been your thoughts that have made you feel
alternately weak and strong.' My <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> looked at me affectionately.
'You have seen how your health has exactly followed your expectations.

you that whatever your powerful <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> believes very intensely <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span>
instantly come to pass.'

"Knowing that Lahiri Mahasaya never spoke idly, I addressed him
with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> awe and gratitude: 'Master, if I think I am <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> and
have regained my former weight, shall that happen?'

"'It is so, even at this moment.' My guru spoke gravely, his gaze
concentrated on my eyes.

"Lo! I felt an increase not alone of strength but of weight. Lahiri
Mahasaya retreated into silence. After a few hours at his feet, I

returned to my mother's home, where I stayed during my visits to
Benares.

"'My son! What is the matter? Are you swelling with dropsy?' Mother
could hardly believe her eyes. My <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> was now of the same robust
dimensions it had possessed before my illness.

"I weighed myself and found that in one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> I had gained fifty
pounds; they remained with me permanently. Friends and acquaintances
who had seen my thin figure were aghast with wonderment. A <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span>
of them changed their mode of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> and became disciples of Lahiri
Mahasaya as a result of this miracle.

"My guru, awake in God, knew this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> to be nothing but an objectivized
dream of the Creator. Because he was completely aware of his unity
with the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Dreamer, Lahiri Mahasaya could materialize or
dematerialize or make any change he wished in the cosmic vision.

"All <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span> is governed by law," Sri Yukteswar concluded. "The ones
which manifest in the outer universe, discoverable by scientists,
are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> natural laws. But there are subtler laws ruling the
realms of <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> which can be known only through the inner
science of yoga. The hidden <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> planes also have their
natural and lawful principles of operation. It is not the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span>

scientist but the fully self-realized <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> who comprehends the

ear after it had been severed by one of the disciples." {FN12-11}

Sri Yukteswar was a peerless interpreter of the scriptures. Many of
my happiest memories are centered in his discourses. But his jeweled
thoughts were not cast into ashes of heedlessness or stupidity. One
restless movement of my body, or my slight lapse into absent-mindedness,
sufficed to put an abrupt period to Master's exposition.

"You are not here." <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> interrupted himself one afternoon with
this disclosure. As usual, he was keeping track of my attention
with a devastating immediacy.

"Guruji!" My tone was a protest. "I have not stirred; my eyelids
have not moved; I can repeat each <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> you have uttered!"

"Nevertheless you were not fully with me. Your objection forces me
to remark that in your mental background you were creating <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span>
institutions. One was a sylvan retreat on a plain, another on a
hilltop, a <span class="t7 hoverable">third</span> by the ocean."

Those vaguely formulated thoughts had indeed been present almost
subconsciously. I glanced at him apologetically.

"What can I do with such a master, who penetrates my random musings?"

"You are ever welcome, Master!"

"Your architectural dreams will materialize later. Now is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span>

Since early youth I had had enigmatic
glimpses of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> buildings, each in a different setting. In the
exact sequence Sri Yukteswar had indicated, these visions <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span>
ultimate form. First came my founding of a boys' yoga school on a

Ranchi plain, then my American headquarters on a Los Angeles hilltop,
finally a hermitage in southern California by the vast Pacific.

<span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> never arrogantly asserted: "I prophesy that such and such
an event shall occur!" He <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> rather hint: "Don't you think it
may happen?" But his simple speech hid vatic power. There was no
recanting; never did his slightly veiled <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> prove false.

Sri Yukteswar was reserved and matter-of-fact in demeanor. There
was naught of the vague or daft visionary about him. His feet
were firm on the earth, his <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> in the haven of heaven. Practical
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> aroused his admiration. "Saintliness is not dumbness! <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span>
perceptions are not incapacitating!" he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> say. "The active
expression of virtue gives rise to the keenest intelligence."

In Master's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> I fully discovered the cleavage between <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span>
realism and the obscure mysticism that spuriously passes as
a counterpart. My guru was reluctant to discuss the superphysical
realms. His only "marvelous" aura was one of perfect simplicity.
In conversation he avoided startling references; in action he was
freely expressive. Others talked of miracles but could manifest
nothing; Sri Yukteswar seldom mentioned the subtle laws but secretly
operated them at will.

"A <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> of realization does not perform any miracle until he

receives an inward sanction," <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> explained. "God does not wish
the secrets of His <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span> revealed promiscuously. {FN12-12} Also,
every individual in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> has inalienable right to his <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span>
will. A saint will not encroach <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> that independence."

The silence habitual to Sri Yukteswar was caused by his deep
perceptions of the Infinite. No <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> remained for the interminable
"revelations" that occupy the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">days</span> of teachers <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> self-realization.
"In shallow <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> the fish of little thoughts cause much commotion.
In oceanic minds the whales of inspiration make hardly a ruffle."
This observation from the Hindu scriptures is not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> discerning
humor.

Because of my guru's unspectacular guise, only a few of his
contemporaries recognized him as a superman. The popular adage: "He
is a fool that cannot conceal his wisdom," could never be applied
to Sri Yukteswar. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Though</span> <span class="t16 t24 hoverable">born</span> a mortal like all others, <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> had
achieved identity with the Ruler of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> and space. In his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> I
perceived a godlike unity. He had not found any insuperable obstacle
to mergence of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> with Divine. No such barrier exists, I came
to understand, save in man's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> unadventurousness.

I always thrilled at the touch of Sri Yukteswar's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">holy</span> feet.
Yogis teach that a disciple is spiritually magnetized by reverent
contact with a master; a subtle current is generated. The devotee's

undesirable habit-mechanisms in the brain are often cauterized; the
groove of his worldly tendencies beneficially disturbed. Momentarily
at least he may <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> the secret veils of MAYA lifting, and glimpse
the reality of bliss. My <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> responded with a liberating
glow whenever I knelt in the Indian fashion before my guru.

"Even when Lahiri Mahasaya was silent," <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> told me, "or when
he conversed on other than strictly religious topics, I discovered
that nonetheless he had transmitted to me ineffable knowledge."

Sri Yukteswar affected me similarly. If I entered the hermitage in
a worried or indifferent frame of mind, my attitude imperceptibly
changed. A healing calm descended at mere sight of my guru. Every
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> with him was a new experience in joy, peace, and wisdom. Never
did I <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> him deluded or intoxicated with greed or emotion or
anger or any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> attachment.

"The darkness of MAYA is silently approaching. Let us hie homeward
within." With these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> at dusk <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> constantly reminded his
disciples of their need for KRIYA YOGA. A new student occasionally
expressed doubts regarding his own worthiness to engage in yoga
practice.

"Forget the past," Sri Yukteswar <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> console him. "The vanished
lives of all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> are dark with many shames. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Human</span> conduct is ever

unreliable until anchored in the Divine. Everything in future will
improve if you are making a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> effort now."

<span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> always had young CHELAS {FN12-13} in his hermitage. Their
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> and intellectual education was his lifelong interest:
even shortly before he passed on, he accepted for training <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span>
six-year-old boys and one youth of sixteen. He directed their minds
and lives with that careful discipline in which the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> "disciple"
is etymologically rooted. The ashram residents loved and revered
their guru; a slight clap of his <span class="t13 t23 hoverable">hands</span> sufficed to <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> them
eagerly to his side. When his mood was silent and withdrawn, no one
ventured to speak; when his laugh rang jovially, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">children</span> looked
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> him as their own.

<span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> seldom asked others to render him a personal service, nor <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span>
he accept help from a student unless the willingness were sincere.
My guru quietly washed his clothes if the disciples overlooked that
privileged task. Sri Yukteswar wore the traditional ocher-colored
swami robe; his laceless shoes, in accordance with yogi custom,
were of tiger or deer skin.

<span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> spoke fluent English, French, Hindi, and Bengali; his
Sanskrit was fair. He patiently instructed his young disciples by
certain short cuts which he had ingeniously devised for the study
of English and Sanskrit.

Master was cautious of his body, while withholding solicitous
attachment. The Infinite, he pointed out, properly manifests through
<span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> and mental soundness. He discountenanced any extremes. A
disciple once started a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> fast. My guru only laughed: "Why not
throw the dog a bone?"

Sri Yukteswar's health was excellent; I never saw him unwell.
{FN12-14} He permitted students to consult doctors if it seemed
advisable. His purpose was to give respect to the worldly custom:
"Physicians must carry on their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> of healing through God's laws
as applied to matter." But he extolled the superiority of mental
therapy, and often repeated: "Wisdom is the greatest cleanser."

"The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> is a treacherous friend. Give it its due; no more,"
he said. "Pain and pleasure are transitory; endure all dualities
with calmness, while trying at the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> to remove their hold.
Imagination is the door through which disease as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as healing
enters. Disbelieve in the reality of sickness even when you are
ill; an unrecognized visitor will flee!"

<span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> numbered many doctors among his disciples. "Those who have
ferreted out the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> laws can easily investigate the science
of the soul," he told them. "A subtle <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> mechanism is hidden
just behind the bodily structure." {FN12-15}

Sri Yukteswar counseled his students to be living liaisons of
Western and Eastern virtues. Himself an executive Occidental in
outer habits, inwardly he was the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> Oriental. He praised
the progressive, resourceful and hygienic habits of the West, and
the religious ideals which give a centuried halo to the East.

Discipline had not been unknown to me: at home <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Father</span> was strict,
Ananta often severe. But Sri Yukteswar's training cannot be described
as other than drastic. A perfectionist, my guru was hypercritical
of his disciples, <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> in matters of moment or in the subtle
nuances of behavior.

"Good manners <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> sincerity are like a beautiful dead lady,"
he remarked on suitable occasion. "Straightforwardness <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span>
civility is like a surgeon's knife, effective but unpleasant. Candor
with courtesy is helpful and admirable."

<span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> was apparently satisfied with my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> progress, for he
seldom referred to it; in other matters my ears were no strangers
to reproof. My chief offenses were absentmindedness, intermittent
indulgence in sad moods, non-observance of certain rules of etiquette,
and occasional unmethodical ways.

"Observe how the activities of your <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">father</span> Bhagabati are well-organized

and balanced in every way," my guru pointed out. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> disciples
of Lahiri Mahasaya had met, soon after I began my pilgrimages
to Serampore. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Father</span> and Sri Yukteswar admiringly evaluated the
other's worth. Both had built an inner <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> granite,
insoluble against the ages.

From transient teachers of my earlier <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> I had imbibed a few
erroneous lessons. A CHELA, I was told, need not concern himself
strenuously over worldly duties; when I had neglected or carelessly
performed my tasks, I was not chastised. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Human</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> finds such
instruction very easy of assimilation. Under Master's unsparing
rod, however, I soon recovered from the agreeable delusions of
irresponsibility.

"Those who are too <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> for this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> are adorning some other,"
Sri Yukteswar remarked. "So <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> as you breathe the <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> air of
earth, you are under obligation to render grateful service. He alone
who has fully mastered the breathless <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> {FN12-16} is freed from
cosmic imperatives. I will not fail to let you know when you have
attained the final perfection."

My guru could never be bribed, even by love. He showed no leniency
to anyone who, like myself, willingly offered to be his disciple.
<span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">Whether</span> <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> and I were surrounded by his students or by strangers,
or were alone together, he always spoke plainly and upbraided

sharply. No trifling lapse into shallowness or inconsistency escaped
his rebuke. This flattening treatment was hard to endure, but my
resolve was to allow Sri Yukteswar to iron out each of my psychological
kinks. As he labored at this titanic transformation, I shook many
times under the weight of his disciplinary hammer.

"If you don't like my words, you are at liberty to leave at any
time," <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> assured me. "I want nothing from you but your own
improvement. Stay only if you feel benefited."

For every humbling blow he dealt my vanity, for every tooth in my
metaphorical jaw he knocked loose with stunning aim, I am grateful
beyond any facility of expression. The hard core of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> egotism
is hardly to be dislodged except rudely. With its departure, the
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> finds at last an unobstructed channel. In vain It seeks to
percolate through flinty hearts of selfishness.

Sri Yukteswar's <span class="t12 t20 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">wisdom</span> was so penetrating that, heedless of remarks,
he often replied to one's unspoken observation. "What a <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span>
imagines he hears, and what the speaker has really implied, may
be poles apart," he said. "Try to feel the thoughts behind the
confusion of men's verbiage."

with superficial students. The wise, always few in number, deeply

revered him. I daresay Sri Yukteswar <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have been the most

censorious.

"I am hard on those who come for my training," he admitted to me.
"That is my way; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> it or leave it. I will never compromise. But
you will be much kinder to your disciples; that is your way. I try
to purify only in the fires of severity, searing beyond the average
toleration. The gentle approach of <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t8 t13 t15 t17 t18 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> is also transfiguring. The
inflexible and the yielding methods are equally effective if applied
with wisdom. You will go to foreign lands, where blunt assaults
on the ego are not appreciated. A teacher could not spread India's

came to <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> in Master's words!

My
parent expected, very likely, to hear some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> in my praise. He
was shocked to be given a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of my imperfections. It was

Master's practice to recount simple, negligible shortcomings with
an air of portentous gravity. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Father</span> rushed to see me. "From your
guru's remarks I <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> to <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> you a complete wreck!" My parent
was between tears and laughter.

The only cause of Sri Yukteswar's displeasure at the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> was that
I had been trying, against his gentle hint, to convert a certain
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> path.

With indignant speed I sought out my guru. He received me with
downcast eyes, as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> conscious of guilt. It was the only <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span>
I ever saw the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> lion meek before me. The unique moment was
savored to the full.

"Sir, why did you judge me so mercilessly before my astounded
father? Was that just?"

"I will not do it again." Master's tone was apologetic.

Instantly I was disarmed. How readily the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> admitted his
fault! <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Though</span> he never again upset Father's <span class="t13 hoverable">peace</span> of mind, <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span>
relentlessly continued to dissect me whenever and wherever he chose.

New disciples often joined Sri Yukteswar in exhaustive criticism
of others. <span class="t8 t12 t17 hoverable">Wise</span> like the guru! Models of flawless discrimination!

But he who takes the offensive must not be defenseless. The same
carping students fled precipitantly as soon as <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> publicly
unloosed in their direction a few shafts from his analytical quiver.

"Tender inner weaknesses, revolting at mild touches of censure,
are like diseased parts of the body, recoiling before even delicate
handling." This was Sri Yukteswar's amused comment on the flighty
ones.

There are disciples who seek a guru made in their own image. Such
students often complained that they did not understand Sri Yukteswar.

"Neither do you comprehend God!" I retorted on one occasion. "When
a saint is clear to you, you will be one." Among the trillion
mysteries, breathing every <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> the inexplicable air, who may
venture to ask that the fathomless <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of a <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> be instantly
grasped?

Students came, and generally went. Those who craved a path of
oily sympathy and comfortable recognitions did not <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> it at the
hermitage. <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> offered shelter and shepherding for the aeons,
but many disciples miserly demanded ego-balm as well. They departed,
preferring life's countless humiliations before any humility.
Master's blazing rays, the open penetrating sunshine of his wisdom,
were too powerful for their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> sickness. They sought some

lesser teacher who, shading them with flattery, permitted the fitful
sleep of ignorance.

During my early months with Master, I had experienced a sensitive
<span class="t28 hoverable">fear</span> of his reprimands. These were reserved, I soon saw, for disciples
who had asked for his verbal vivisection. If any writhing student
made a protest, Sri Yukteswar <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> become unoffendedly silent.
His <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> were never wrathful, but impersonal with wisdom.

Master's insight was not for the unprepared ears of casual visitors; he
seldom remarked on their defects, even if conspicuous. But toward
students who sought his counsel, Sri Yukteswar felt a serious
responsibility. Brave indeed is the guru who undertakes to transform
the crude ore of ego-permeated humanity! A saint's courage roots
in his compassion for the stumbling eyeless of this world.

When I had abandoned underlying resentment, I found a marked decrease
in my chastisement. In a very subtle way, <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> melted into
comparative clemency. In <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> I demolished every wall of rationalization
and subconscious reservation behind which the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> personality
generally shields itself. {FN12-17} The reward was an effortless
harmony with my guru. I discovered him then to be trusting, considerate,
and silently loving. Undemonstrative, however, he bestowed no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span>
of affection.

My own temperament is principally devotional. It was disconcerting
at first to <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> that my guru, saturated with JNANA but seemingly
dry of BHAKTI, {FN12-18} expressed himself only in terms of
cold <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> mathematics. But as I tuned myself to his nature,
I discovered no diminution but rather increase in my devotional
approach to God. A self-realized <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> is fully able to guide his
various disciples along natural lines of their essential bias.

My relationship with Sri Yukteswar, somewhat inarticulate, nonetheless
possessed all eloquence. Often I found his silent signature on my
thoughts, rendering speech inutile. Quietly sitting beside him, I
felt his bounty pouring peacefully over my being.

Sri Yukteswar's impartial justice was notably demonstrated during
the summer vacation of my first college year. I welcomed the opportunity
to spend uninterrupted months at Serampore with my guru.

"You may be in charge of the hermitage." <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> was pleased over
my enthusiastic arrival. "Your duties will be the reception of
guests, and supervision of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> of the other disciples."

Kumar, a young villager from east Bengal, was accepted a fortnight
later for hermitage training. Remarkably intelligent, he quickly
won Sri Yukteswar's affection. For some unfathomable reason, <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span>
was very lenient to the new resident.

"Mukunda, let Kumar assume your duties. Employ your own <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> in
sweeping and cooking." <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> issued these instructions after the
new boy had been with us for a month.

Exalted to leadership, Kumar exercised a petty household tyranny.
In silent mutiny, the other disciples continued to seek me out for
daily counsel.

"Mukunda is impossible! You made me supervisor, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> the others go
to him and obey him." <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Three</span> weeks later Kumar was complaining to
our guru. I overheard him from an adjoining room.

"That's why I assigned him to the kitchen and you to the parlor."
Sri Yukteswar's withering tones were new to Kumar. "In this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> you
have come to realize that a worthy leader has the <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> to serve,
and not to dominate. You wanted Mukunda's position, but could not
maintain it by merit. Return now to your earlier <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> as cook's
assistant."

After this humbling incident, <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> resumed toward Kumar a former
attitude of unwonted indulgence. Who can solve the mystery of
attraction? In Kumar our guru discovered a charming fount which
did not spurt for the fellow disciples. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Though</span> the new boy was
obviously Sri Yukteswar's favorite, I felt no dismay. Personal

idiosyncrasies, possessed even by masters, lend a rich complexity
to the pattern of life. My <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> is seldom commandeered by a detail;
I was seeking from Sri Yukteswar a more inaccessible benefit than
an outward praise.

Kumar spoke venomously to me one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> reason; I was deeply
hurt.

"Your <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> is swelling to the bursting point!" I added a warning
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> I felt intuitively: "Unless you mend your ways, someday
you will be asked to leave this ashram."

Laughing sarcastically, Kumar repeated my remark to our guru, who
had just entered the room. Fully expecting to be scolded, I retired
meekly to a corner.

"Maybe Mukunda is right." Master's reply to the boy came with
unusual coldness. I escaped <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> castigation.

A year later, Kumar <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> out for a visit to his childhood home.
He ignored the quiet disapproval of Sri Yukteswar, who never
authoritatively controlled his disciples' movements. On the boy's
return to Serampore in a few months, a change was unpleasantly
apparent. Gone was the stately Kumar with serenely glowing face.
Only an undistinguished peasant stood before us, one who had lately

acquired a <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> habits.

<span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> summoned me and brokenheartedly discussed the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that the
boy was now unsuited to the monastic hermitage life.

"Mukunda, I will leave it to you to instruct Kumar to leave the
ashram tomorrow; I can't do it!" Tears stood in Sri Yukteswar's
eyes, but he controlled himself quickly. "The boy <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> never have
fallen to these depths had he listened to me and not gone away to
mix with undesirable companions. He has rejected my protection;
the callous <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> must be his guru still."

Kumar's departure <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> me no elation; sadly I wondered how one
with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> to win a master's <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t8 t13 t15 t17 t18 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> could ever respond to cheaper
allures. Enjoyment of wine and sex are rooted in the natural man,
and require no delicacies of perception for their appreciation.
<span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">Sense</span> wiles are comparable to the evergreen oleander, fragrant with
its multicolored flowers: every part of the plant is poisonous. The
<span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">land</span> of healing lies within, radiant with that happiness blindly
sought in a <span class="t15 t23 hoverable">thousand</span> misdirections. {FN12-19}

"Keen <span class="t14 t24 hoverable">intelligence</span> is two-edged," <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> once remarked in reference
to Kumar's brilliant mind. "It may be <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> constructively or
destructively like a knife, either to cut the boil of ignorance,
or to decapitate one's self. <span class="t14 t24 hoverable">Intelligence</span> is rightly guided only

law."

My guru mixed freely with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> and women disciples, treating
all as his children. Perceiving their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> equality, he showed no
distinction or partiality.

"In sleep, you do not know <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> you are a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> or a woman," he
said. "Just as a man, impersonating a woman, does not become one,
so the soul, impersonating both <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> and woman, has no sex. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span>
is the pure, changeless image of God."

Sri Yukteswar never avoided or blamed women as objects of seduction.
Men, he said, were also a temptation to women. I once inquired of
my guru why a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> ancient saint had <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> women "the door to
hell."

"A girl must have proved very troublesome to his <span class="t13 hoverable">peace</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> in
his early life," my guru answered causticly. "Otherwise he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have
denounced, not woman, but some imperfection in his own self-control."

If a visitor dared to relate a suggestive story in the hermitage,
<span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> maintain an unresponsive silence. "Do not allow yourself
to be thrashed by the provoking whip of a beautiful face," he told
the disciples. "How can <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> slaves enjoy the world? Its subtle

flavors escape them while they grovel in primal mud. All nice
discriminations are lost to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> of elemental lusts."

Students seeking to escape from the dualistic MAYA delusion received
from Sri Yukteswar patient and understanding counsel.

"Just as the purpose of eating is to satisfy hunger, not greed,
so the sex instinct is designed for the propagation of the species
according to natural law, never for the kindling of insatiable
longings," he said. "Destroy wrong desires now; otherwise they
will follow you after the astral <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> is torn from its <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span>
casing. Even when the <span class="t21 hoverable">flesh</span> is weak, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> should be constantly
resistant. If temptation assails you with cruel force, overcome it
by impersonal analysis and indomitable will. Every natural passion
can be mastered.

"Conserve your powers. Be like the capacious ocean, absorbing
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> all the tributary rivers of the senses. Small yearnings are
openings in the reservoir of your inner peace, permitting healing
waters to be wasted in the desert soil of materialism. The forceful
activating impulse of wrong <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> is the greatest enemy to the
happiness of man. Roam in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> as a lion of self-control;
see that the frogs of weakness don't kick you around."

The devotee is finally freed from all instinctive compulsions. He

transforms his need for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> affection into aspiration for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span>
alone, a <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t8 t13 t15 t17 t18 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> solitary because omnipresent.

Sri Yukteswar's mother lived in the Rana Mahal district of Benares
where I had first visited my guru. Gracious and kindly, she was
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> a woman of very decided opinions. I stood on her balcony one
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> and watched mother and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> talking together. In his quiet,
sensible way, <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> was trying to convince her about something.
He was apparently unsuccessful, for she shook her <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>
vigor.

"Nay, nay, my son, go away now! Your <span class="t8 t12 t17 hoverable">wise</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> are not for me! I
am not your disciple!"

Sri Yukteswar backed away <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> further argument, like a scolded
child. I was touched at his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> respect for his mother even in
her unreasonable moods. She saw him only as her little boy, not as a
sage. There was a charm about the trifling incident; it supplied
a sidelight on my guru's unusual nature, inwardly humble and
outwardly unbendable.

The monastic regulations do not allow a swami to retain connection
with worldly ties after their formal severance. He cannot perform
the ceremonial family rites which are obligatory on the householder.
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> Shankara, the ancient founder of the Swami Order, disregarded

the injunctions. At the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">death</span> of his beloved mother, he cremated her
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> with heavenly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> which he caused to spurt from his upraised
hand.

Sri Yukteswar also ignored the restrictions, in a fashion less
spectacular. When his mother passed on, he arranged the crematory
services by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">holy</span> Ganges in Benares, and fed many Brahmins in
conformance with age-old custom.

The SHASTRIC prohibitions were intended to help swamis overcome
narrow identifications. Shankara and Sri Yukteswar had wholly merged
their <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> in the Impersonal Spirit; they needed no rescue by
rule. Sometimes, too, a <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> purposely ignores a canon in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span>
to uphold its principle as superior to and independent of form. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span>
<span class="t0 t6 t8 t9 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t22 t23 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Jesus</span> plucked ears of corn on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> of rest. To the inevitable
critics he said: "The sabbath was made for man, and not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> for
the sabbath." {FN12-20}

Outside of the scriptures, seldom was a <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">book</span> honored by Sri
Yukteswar's perusal. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> he was invariably acquainted with the
latest scientific discoveries and other advancements of knowledge.
A brilliant conversationalist, he enjoyed an exchange of views on
countless topics with his guests. My guru's ready wit and rollicking
laugh enlivened every discussion. Often grave, <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> was never
gloomy. "To seek the Lord, one need not disfigure his face," he

would remark. "Remember that finding <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> will mean the funeral of
all sorrows."

Among the philosophers, professors, lawyers and scientists who came
to the hermitage, a <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> arrived for their first visit with the
expectation of meeting an orthodox religionist. A supercilious
smile or a glance of amused tolerance occasionally betrayed that
the newcomers anticipated nothing more than a few pious platitudes.
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> their reluctant departure <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> an expressed conviction
that Sri Yukteswar had shown precise insight into their specialized
fields.

My guru ordinarily was gentle and affable to guests; his welcome was
given with charming cordiality. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> inveterate egotists sometimes
suffered an invigorating shock. They confronted in <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> either
a frigid indifference or a formidable opposition: ice or iron!

A noted chemist once crossed swords with Sri Yukteswar. The
visitor <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> not admit the <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> of God, inasmuch as science
has devised no means of detecting Him.

"So you have inexplicably failed to isolate the Supreme <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Power</span> in
your test tubes!" Master's gaze was stern. "I recommend an unheard-of
experiment. Examine your thoughts unremittingly for twenty-four
hours. Then wonder no longer at God's absence."

A celebrated pundit received a similar jolt. With ostentatious
zeal, the scholar shook the ashram rafters with scriptural lore.
Resounding passages poured from the MAHABHARATA, the UPANISHADS,
{FN12-21} the BHASYAS {FN12-22} of Shankara.

"I am waiting to hear you." Sri Yukteswar's tone was inquiring, as
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> utter silence had reigned. The pundit was puzzled.

"Quotations there have been, in superabundance." Master's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span>
convulsed me with mirth, as I squatted in my corner, at a respectful
distance from the visitor. "But what original commentary can you
supply, from the uniqueness of your particular life? What <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">holy</span>
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> have you absorbed and made your own? In what ways have these
timeless truths renovated your nature? Are you content to be a
hollow victrola, mechanically repeating the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> of other men?"

"I give up!" The scholar's chagrin was comical. "I have no inner
realization."

For the first time, perhaps, he understood that discerning placement
of the comma does not atone for a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> coma.

"These bloodless pedants smell unduly of the lamp," my guru remarked
after the departure of the chastened one. "They prefer philosophy

to be a gentle intellectual setting-up exercise. Their elevated
thoughts are carefully unrelated either to the crudity of outward
action or to any scourging inner discipline!"

<span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> stressed on other occasions the futility of mere <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">book</span>
learning.

"Do not confuse understanding with a larger vocabulary," he remarked.
"Sacred writings are beneficial in stimulating <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> for inward
realization, if one stanza at a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> is slowly assimilated. Continual
intellectual study results in vanity and the false satisfaction of
an undigested knowledge."

Sri Yukteswar related one of his own experiences in scriptural
edification. The scene was a forest hermitage in eastern Bengal,
where he observed the procedure of a renowned teacher, Dabru Ballav.
His method, at once simple and difficult, was common in ancient
India.

Dabru Ballav had gathered his disciples around him in the sylvan
solitudes. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">holy</span> BHAGAVAD GITA was open before them. Steadfastly
they looked at one <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> for half an hour, then closed their eyes.
Another half hour slipped away. The <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> gave a brief comment.
Motionless, they meditated again for an hour. Finally the guru
spoke.

"Have you understood?"

"Yes, sir." One in the group ventured this assertion.

"No; not fully. Seek the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> vitality that has given these
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> to rejuvenate India century after century." Another
hour disappeared in silence. The <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> dismissed the students,
and turned to Sri Yukteswar.

"Do you know the BHAGAVAD GITA?"

"No, sir, not really; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> my <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> have run through its
pages many times."

"Thousands have replied to me differently!" The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> sage smiled
at <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> in blessing. "If one busies himself with an outer display
of scriptural wealth, what <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> is <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> for silent inward diving
after the priceless pearls?"

Sri Yukteswar directed the study of his own disciples by the same
intensive method of one-pointedness. "Wisdom is not assimilated
with the eyes, but with the atoms," he said. "When your conviction
of a <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> is not merely in your brain but in your being, you may
diffidently vouch for its meaning." He discouraged any tendency a

student might have to construe book-knowledge as a necessary step
to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> realization.

"The RISHIS wrote in one sentence profundities that commentating
scholars busy themselves over for generations," he remarked. "Endless
literary controversy is for sluggard minds. What more liberating
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> than 'God is'-nay, 'God'?"

But <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> does not easily return to simplicity. It is seldom "God"
for him, but rather learned pomposities. His ego is pleased, that
he can grasp such erudition.

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Men</span> who were pridefully conscious of <span class="t23 hoverable">high</span> worldly position were likely,
in Master's presence, to add humility to their other possessions.
A local magistrate once arrived for an interview at the seaside
hermitage in Puri. The man, who held a reputation for ruthlessness, had
it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> to oust us from the ashram. I cautioned
my guru about the despotic possibilities. But he seated himself
with an uncompromising air, and did not rise to greet the visitor.
Slightly nervous, I squatted near the door. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> had to content
himself with a wooden box; my guru did not request me to fetch
a chair. There was no fulfillment of the magistrate's obvious
expectation that his importance <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be ceremoniously acknowledged.

A metaphysical discussion ensued. The guest blundered through

misinterpretations of the scriptures. As his accuracy sank, his
ire rose.

"Do you know that I stood first in the M. A. examination?" <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">Reason</span>
had forsaken him, but he could still shout.

"Mr. Magistrate, you forget that this is not your courtroom," <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span>
replied evenly. "From your childish remarks I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have surmised
that your college career was unremarkable. A university degree,
in any case, is not remotely related to Vedic realization. Saints
are not produced in batches every semester like accountants."

After a stunned silence, the visitor laughed heartily.

"This is my first encounter with a heavenly magistrate," he said.
Later he made a formal request, couched in the legal terms which
were evidently part and parcel of his being, to be accepted as a
"probationary" disciple.

My guru personally attended to the details connected with the
management of his property. Unscrupulous persons on various occasions
attempted to secure possession of Master's ancestral land. With
determination and even by instigating lawsuits, Sri Yukteswar
outwitted every opponent. He underwent these painful experiences from
a <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> never to be a begging guru, or a burden on his disciples.

His financial independence was one <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> why my alarmingly
outspoken <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> was innocent of the cunnings of diplomacy. Unlike
those teachers who have to flatter their supporters, my guru was
impervious to the influences, open or subtle, of others' wealth.
Never did I hear him ask or even hint for money for any purpose.
His hermitage training was given <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> and freely to all disciples.

An insolent court deputy arrived one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> at the Serampore ashram
to serve Sri Yukteswar with a legal summons. A disciple named Kanai
and myself were also present. The officer's attitude toward <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span>
was offensive.

"It will do you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> to leave the shadows of your hermitage and breathe
the honest air of a courtroom." The deputy grinned contemptuously.
I could not contain myself.

"Another <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> of your impudence and you will be on the floor!" I
advanced threateningly.

"You wretch!" Kanai's shout was simultaneous with my own. "Dare
you <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> your blasphemies into this sacred ashram?"

But <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> stood protectingly in front of his abuser. "Don't get
excited over nothing. This <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> is only doing his rightful duty."

The officer, dazed at his varying reception, respectfully offered
a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> of apology and sped away.

Amazing it was to <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> that a <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> with such a fiery will could
be so calm within. He fitted the Vedic definition of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> of God:
"Softer than the flower, where kindness is concerned; stronger than
the thunder, where principles are at stake."

There are always those in this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> who, in Browning's words,
"endure no light, being themselves obscure." An outsider occasionally
berated Sri Yukteswar for an imaginary grievance. My imperturbable
guru listened politely, analyzing himself to see if any shred of
<span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> lay <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the denunciation. These scenes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> to my

be tall by cutting off the heads of others!"

The unfailing composure of a saint is impressive beyond any sermon.
"He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; and he that
ruleth his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> than he that taketh a city." {FN12-23}

I often reflected that my majestic <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> could easily have been
an emperor or world-shaking warrior had his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> been centered on
fame or worldly achievement. He had chosen instead to storm those
inner citadels of wrath and egotism <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> fall is the height of a

{FN12-1} "Worship of Durga." This is the chief festival of the
Bengali year and lasts for nine <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">days</span> around the end of September.
Immediately following is the ten-day festival of DASHAHARA ("the One
who removes ten sins"-three of body, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> of mind, four of speech).
Both PUJAS are sacred to Durga, literally "the Inaccessible," an
aspect of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Mother, Shakti, the female creative force personified.

{FN12-2} Sri Yukteswar was <span class="t16 t24 hoverable">born</span> on May 10, 1855.

{FN12-3} YUKTESWAR means "united to God." GIRI is a classificatory
distinction of one of the ten ancient Swami branches. SRI means
"holy"; it is not a name but a title of respect.

{FN12-4} Literally, "to direct together." SAMADHI is a superconscious
<span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of ecstasy in which the yogi perceives the identity of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span>

{FN12-9} Lahiri Mahasaya actually said "Priya" (first or given
name), not "Yukteswar" (monastic name, not received by my guru
during Lahiri Mahasaya's lifetime). (See page 109.) "Yukteswar" is
substituted here, and in a few other places in this book, in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span>

{FN12-15} A courageous medical man, Charles Robert Richet, awarded
the Nobel Prize in physiology, wrote as follows: "Metaphysics is not

ways. . . . Because a <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> is rare is no <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> that it does
not exist. Because a study is difficult, is that a <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> for not
understanding it? . . . Those who have railed at metaphysics as
an occult science will be as ashamed of themselves as those who
railed at chemistry on the ground that pursuit of the philosopher's
stone was illusory. . . . In the <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> of principles there are only
those of Lavoisier, Claude Bernard, and Pasteur-the EXPERIMENTAL
everywhere and always. Greetings, then, to the new science which

is going to change the orientation of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> thought."

{FN12-17} The subconsciously guided rationalizations of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span>

issues from the superconsciousness. Led by French scientists of
the Sorbonne, Western thinkers are beginning to investigate the
possibility of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> perception in man.

"For the past twenty years, students of psychology, influenced by

actions, but not all of our actions. It can explain the abnormal,
but not deeds that are above the normal. The latest psychology,
sponsored by the French schools, has discovered a new region in man,
which it terms the superconscious. In contrast to the subconscious
which represents the submerged currents of our nature, it reveals
the heights to which our <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> can reach. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Man</span> represents a triple,
not a double, personality; our conscious and subconscious being
is crowned by a superconsciousness. Many <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> ago the English
psychologist, F. W. H. Myers, suggested that 'hidden in the

In contrast to the psychology that centers all its researches
on the subconscious in man's nature, this new psychology of the
superconscious focuses its attention <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the treasure-house, the

CHAPTER: 13

THE SLEEPLESS SAINT

"Please permit me to go to the Himalayas. I hope in unbroken solitude
to achieve continuous <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> communion."

I actually once addressed these ungrateful <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> to my Master.
Seized by one of the unpredictable delusions which occasionally
assail the devotee, I felt a growing impatience with hermitage
duties and college studies. A feebly extenuating circumstance is
that my proposal was made when I had been only six months with Sri
Yukteswar. Not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> had I fully surveyed his towering stature.

"Many hillmen live in the Himalayas, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> possess no God-perception."
My guru's answer came slowly and simply. "Wisdom is better sought
from a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> of realization than from an inert mountain."

Ignoring Master's plain hint that he, and not a hill, was my teacher,
I repeated my plea. Sri Yukteswar vouchsafed no reply. I <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> his
silence for consent, a precarious interpretation readily accepted
at one's convenience.

In my Calcutta home that evening, I busied myself with travel
preparations. Tying a few articles inside a blanket, I remembered
a similar bundle, surreptitiously dropped from my attic window a
few <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> earlier. I wondered if this were to be another ill-starred
flight toward the Himalayas. The first <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> elation had
been high; tonight conscience smote heavily at <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> of leaving
my guru.

The following morning I sought out Behari Pundit, my Sanskrit
professor at Scottish Church College.

"Sir, you have told me of your friendship with a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> disciple of
Lahiri Mahasaya. Please give me his address."

"You mean Ram Gopal Muzumdar. I <span class="t3 t11 t18 t27 hoverable">call</span> him the 'sleepless saint.'

He is always awake in an ecstatic consciousness. His home is at
Ranbajpur, near Tarakeswar."

I thanked the pundit, and entrained immediately for Tarakeswar.
I hoped to silence my misgivings by wringing a sanction from the
"sleepless saint" to engage myself in lonely Himalayan meditation.
Behari's friend, I heard, had received illumination after many
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> of KRIYA YOGA practice in isolated caves.

At Tarakeswar I approached a famous shrine. Hindus regard it with
the same veneration that Catholics give to the Lourdes sanctuary in
France. Innumerable healing miracles have occurred at Tarakeswar,
including one for a member of my family.

"I sat in the temple there for a week," my eldest aunt once told
me. "Observing a complete fast, I prayed for the recovery of your
Uncle Sarada from a chronic malady. On the seventh <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> I found a
herb materialized in my hand! I made a brew from the leaves, and
gave it to your uncle. His disease vanished at once, and has never
reappeared."

I entered the sacred Tarakeswar shrine; the altar contains nothing
but a round stone. Its circumference, beginningless and endless,
makes it aptly significant of the Infinite. Cosmic abstractions are
not alien even to the humblest Indian peasant; he has been accused

by Westerners, in fact, of living on abstractions!

My own mood at the moment was so austere that I felt disinclined
to bow before the stone symbol. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> should be sought, I reflected,
only <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the soul.

I <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> the temple <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> genuflection and walked briskly toward
the outlying village of Ranbajpur. My appeal to a passer-by for
guidance caused him to sink into <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> cogitation.

"When you come to a crossroad, turn right and keep going," he
finally pronounced oracularly.

Obeying the directions, I wended my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> alongside the banks of
a canal. Darkness fell; the outskirts of the jungle village were
alive with winking fireflies and the howls of near-by jackals. The
moonlight was too faint to supply any reassurance; I stumbled on
for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> hours.

Welcome clang of a cowbell! My repeated shouts eventually <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span>
a peasant to my side.

"I am looking for Ram Gopal Babu."

"No such <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> lives in our village." The man's tone was surly.

"You are probably a lying detective."

Hoping to allay suspicion in his politically troubled mind,
I touchingly explained my predicament. He <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> me to his home and
offered a hospitable welcome.

"Ranbajpur is far from here," he remarked. "At the crossroad, you
should have turned left, not right."

My earlier informant, I <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> sadly, was a distinct menace to
travelers. After a relishable meal of coarse rice, lentil-DHAL,
and curry of potatoes with raw bananas, I retired to a small hut
adjoining the courtyard. In the distance, villagers were singing
to the loud accompaniment of MRIDANGAS {FN13-1} and cymbals. Sleep
was inconsiderable that night; I prayed deeply to be directed to
the secret yogi, Ram Gopal.

As the first streaks of dawn penetrated the fissures of my dark
room, I <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> out for Ranbajpur. Crossing rough paddy fields, I trudged
over sickled stumps of the prickly plant and mounds of dried clay.
An occasionally-met peasant <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> inform me, invariably, that my
destination was "only a KROSHA (two miles)." In six hours the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span>
traveled victoriously from horizon to meridian, but I began to feel
that I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> ever be distant from Ranbajpur by one KROSHA.

At midafternoon my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> was still an endless paddy field. Heat
pouring from the avoidless sky was bringing me to near-collapse. As
a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> approached at leisurely pace, I hardly dared utter my usual
question, lest it summon the monotonous: "Just a KROSHA."

The stranger halted beside me. Short and slight, he was physically
unimpressive save for an extraordinary pair of piercing dark eyes.

"I was planning to leave Ranbajpur, but your purpose was good, so
I awaited you." He shook his finger in my astounded face. "Aren't
you clever to think that, unannounced, you could pounce on me? That
professor Behari had no right to give you my address."

Considering that introduction of myself <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be mere verbosity in
the presence of this master, I stood speechless, somewhat hurt at
my reception. His next remark was abruptly put.

"Tell me; where do you think <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> is?"

"Why, He is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> me and everywhere." I doubtless looked as
bewildered as I felt.

"All-pervading, eh?" The saint chuckled. "Then why, young sir,
did you fail to bow before the Infinite in the stone symbol at the
Tarakeswar temple yesterday? {FN13-2} Your pride caused you the

punishment of being misdirected by the passer-by who was not bothered
by fine distinctions of <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> and right. Today, too, you have had
a fairly uncomfortable <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of it!"

I agreed wholeheartedly, wonder-struck that an omniscient eye hid
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the unremarkable <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> before me. Healing strength emanated
from the yogi; I was instantly refreshed in the scorching field.

"The devotee inclines to think his path to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> is the only way," he
said. "Yoga, through which divinity is found within, is doubtless
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> road: so Lahiri Mahasaya has told us. But discovering
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> within, we soon perceive Him without. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Holy</span> shrines at
Tarakeswar and elsewhere are rightly venerated as nuclear centers
of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> power."

The saint's censorious attitude vanished; his <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> became
compassionately soft. He patted my shoulder.

"Young yogi, I see you are running away from your master. He
has everything you need; you must return to him. Mountains cannot
be your guru." Ram Gopal was repeating the same <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> which Sri
Yukteswar had expressed at our last meeting.

"Masters are under no cosmic compulsion to limit their residence."
My companion glanced at me quizzically. "The Himalayas in India

and Tibet have no monopoly on saints. What one does not trouble to
<span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> will not be discovered by transporting the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> hither
and yon. As soon as the devotee is WILLING to go even to the ends
of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> enlightenment, his guru appears near-by."

I silently agreed, recalling my prayer in the Benares hermitage,
followed by the meeting with Sri Yukteswar in a crowded lane.

"Are you able to have a little room where you can close the door
and be alone?"

"Yes." I reflected that this saint descended from the general to
the particular with disconcerting speed.

"That is your cave." The yogi bestowed on me a gaze of illumination
which I have never forgotten. "That is your sacred mountain. That
is where you will <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> the kingdom of God."

His simple <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> instantaneously banished my lifelong obsession for
the Himalayas. In a burning paddy field I awoke from the monticolous
dreams of <span class="t20 hoverable">eternal</span> snows.

"Young sir, your <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> thirst is laudable. I feel <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t8 t13 t15 t17 t18 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> for
you." Ram Gopal <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> and led me to a quaint hamlet. The
adobe houses were covered with coconut leaves and adorned with

rustic entrances.

The saint seated me on the umbrageous bamboo platform of his small
cottage. After giving me sweetened lime juice and a piece of rock
candy, he entered his patio and assumed the lotus posture. In about
four hours I opened my meditative <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> and saw that the moonlit
figure of the yogi was still motionless. As I was sternly reminding
my stomach that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> does not live by bread alone, Ram Gopal approached
me.

"I see you are famished; <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> will be ready soon."

A <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> was kindled under a clay oven on the patio; rice and DHAL
were quickly served on large banana leaves. My host courteously
refused my aid in all cooking chores. "The guest is God," a Hindu
proverb, has commanded devout observance from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> immemorial. In
my later <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> travels, I was charmed to see that a similar respect
for visitors is manifested in rural sections of many countries.
The <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">city</span> dweller finds the keen edge of hospitality blunted by
superabundance of strange faces.

The marts of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> seemed remotely dim as I squatted by the yogi
in the isolation of the tiny jungle village. The cottage room
was mysterious with a mellow light. Ram Gopal arranged some torn
blankets on the floor for my bed, and seated himself on a straw

mat. Overwhelmed by his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> magnetism, I ventured a request.

"Sir, why don't you grant me a SAMADHI?"

"Dear one, I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be glad to convey the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> contact, but it
is not my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> to do so." The saint looked at me with half-closed
eyes. "Your <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> will bestow that experience shortly. Your <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span>
is not tuned just yet. As a small lamp cannot withstand excessive
electrical voltage, so your nerves are unready for the cosmic
current. If I gave you the infinite ecstasy right now, you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span>
burn as if every cell were on fire.

"You are asking illumination from me," the yogi continued musingly,
"while I am wondering-inconsiderable as I am, and with the little
<span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> I have done-if I have succeeded in pleasing God, and
what worth I may <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> in His <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> at the final reckoning."

"Sir, have you not been singleheartedly seeking <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> for a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span>
time?"

"I have not done much. Behari must have told you something of
my life. For twenty <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> I occupied a secret grotto, meditating
eighteen hours a day. Then I moved to a more inaccessible cave
and remained there for twenty-five years, entering the yoga union
for twenty hours daily. I did not need sleep, for I was ever

with God. My <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> was more rested in the complete calmness of the
superconsciousness than it could be by the partial <span class="t13 hoverable">peace</span> of the
ordinary subconscious state.

"The muscles relax during sleep, but the heart, lungs, and
circulatory system are constantly at work; they get no rest. In
superconsciousness, the internal organs remain in a <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of suspended
animation, electrified by the cosmic energy. By such means I have
found it unnecessary to sleep for years. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> will come when
you too will dispense with sleep."

"My goodness, you have meditated for so <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> are unsure
of the Lord's favor!" I gazed at him in astonishment. "Then what
about us poor mortals?"

"Well, don't you see, my dear boy, that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> is Eternity Itself? To
assume that one can fully know Him by forty-five <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> of <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span>
is rather a preposterous expectation. Babaji assures us, however,
that even a little <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> saves one from the dire <span class="t28 hoverable">fear</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">death</span>
and after-death states. Do not fix your <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> ideal on a small
mountain, but hitch it to the star of unqualified <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> attainment.
If you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> hard, you will get there."

Enthralled by the prospect, I asked him for further enlightening
words. He related a wondrous story of his first meeting with Lahiri

Mahasaya's guru, Babaji. {FN13-3} Around midnight Ram Gopal fell
into silence, and I lay down on my blankets. Closing my eyes, I
saw flashes of lightning; the vast space <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> me was a chamber
of molten light. I opened my <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> and observed the same dazzling
radiance. The room became a part of that infinite vault which I
beheld with interior vision.

"Why don't you go to sleep?"

"Sir, how can I sleep in the presence of lightning, blazing <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span>
my <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> are shut or open?"

"You are <span class="t11 hoverable">blessed</span> to have this experience; the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> radiations
are not easily seen." The saint added a few <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> of affection.

At dawn Ram Gopal gave me rock candies and said I must depart. I
felt such reluctance to bid him farewell that tears coursed down
my cheeks.

"I will not let you go empty-handed." The yogi spoke tenderly. "I
will do something for you."

He smiled and looked at me steadfastly. I stood rooted to the
ground, <span class="t13 hoverable">peace</span> rushing like a mighty flood through the gates of my
eyes. I was instantaneously healed of a pain in my back, which had

troubled me intermittently for years. Renewed, bathed in a sea of
luminous joy, I wept no more. After touching the saint's feet, I
sauntered into the jungle, making my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> through its tropical tangle
until I reached Tarakeswar.

There I made a <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> pilgrimage to the famous shrine, and prostrated
myself fully before the altar. The round stone enlarged before
my inner vision until it became the cosmical spheres, ring <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span>
ring, zone after zone, all dowered with divinity.

I entrained happily an hour later for Calcutta. My travels ended,
not in the lofty mountains, but in the Himalayan presence of my
Master.

CHAPTER: 14

AN EXPERIENCE IN COSMIC <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">CONSCIOUSNESS</span>

"I am here, Guruji." My shamefacedness spoke more eloquently for
me.

"Let us go to the kitchen and <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> something to eat." Sri Yukteswar's
manner was as natural as if hours and not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">days</span> had separated us.

"Master, I must have disappointed you by my abrupt departure from
my duties here; I <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> you might be angry with me."

"No, of course not! Wrath springs only from thwarted desires. I
do not expect anything from others, so their actions cannot be in
opposition to wishes of mine. I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> not <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> you for my own ends;
I am happy only in your own <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> happiness."

"Sir, one hears of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t8 t13 t15 t17 t18 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> in a vague way, but for the first
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> I am having a concrete example in your angelic self! In the
world, even a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">father</span> does not easily forgive his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> if he leaves
his parent's business <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> warning. But you show not the slightest
vexation, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> you must have been put to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> inconvenience by
the many unfinished tasks I <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> behind."

We looked into each other's eyes, where tears were shining. A
blissful wave engulfed me; I was conscious that the Lord, in the

form of my guru, was expanding the small ardors of my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> into
the incompressible reaches of cosmic love.

A few mornings later I made my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> to Master's empty sitting room.
I planned to meditate, but my laudable purpose was unshared by
disobedient thoughts. They scattered like birds before the hunter.

"Mukunda!" Sri Yukteswar's <span class="t23 hoverable">voice</span> sounded from a distant inner
balcony.

I felt as rebellious as my thoughts. "Master always urges me to
meditate," I muttered to myself. "He should not disturb me when he
knows why I came to his room."

He summoned me again; I remained obstinately silent. The <span class="t7 hoverable">third</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span>
his tone held rebuke.

"Sir, I am meditating," I shouted protestingly.

"I know how you are meditating," my guru <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> out, "with your
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> distributed like leaves in a storm! Come here to me."

Snubbed and exposed, I made my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> sadly to his side.

"Poor boy, the mountains couldn't give what you wanted." <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span>

spoke caressively, comfortingly. His calm gaze was unfathomable.
"Your heart's <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> shall be fulfilled."

Sri Yukteswar seldom indulged in riddles; I was bewildered. He
struck gently on my chest above the heart.

My <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> became immovably rooted; breath was drawn out of my lungs
as if by some huge magnet. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Soul</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> instantly lost their
<span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> bondage, and streamed out like a fluid piercing <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span>
from my every pore. The <span class="t21 hoverable">flesh</span> was as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> dead, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> in my intense
awareness I knew that never before had I been fully alive. My <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span>
of identity was no longer narrowly confined to a body, but embraced
the circumambient atoms. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">People</span> on distant streets seemed to be
moving gently over my own remote periphery. The roots of plants and
trees appeared through a dim transparency of the soil; I discerned
the inward flow of their sap.

The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> vicinity lay bare before me. My ordinary frontal
vision was now changed to a vast spherical sight, simultaneously
all-perceptive. Through the back of my <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> I saw <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> strolling far
down Rai Ghat Road, and noticed also a white cow who was leisurely
approaching. When she reached the space in front of the open ashram
gate, I observed her with my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> eyes. As she passed by,
behind the brick wall, I saw her clearly still.

All objects <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> my panoramic gaze trembled and vibrated like
quick motion pictures. My body, Master's, the pillared courtyard,
the furniture and floor, the trees and sunshine, occasionally became
violently agitated, until all melted into a luminescent sea; even
as sugar crystals, thrown into a glass of water, dissolve after
being shaken. The unifying <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> alternated with materializations
of form, the metamorphoses revealing the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">law</span> of cause and effect
in creation.

An oceanic joy broke <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> calm endless shores of my soul. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Spirit</span>
of God, I realized, is exhaustless Bliss; His <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> is countless
tissues of light. A swelling <span class="t0 t7 t21 t27 hoverable">glory</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> me began to envelop towns,
continents, the earth, solar and stellar systems, tenuous nebulae,
and floating universes. The entire cosmos, gently luminous, like
a <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">city</span> seen afar at night, glimmered <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the infinitude of
my being. The sharply etched global outlines faded somewhat at the
farthest edges; there I could see a mellow radiance, ever-undiminished.
It was indescribably subtle; the planetary pictures were formed of
a grosser light.

The <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> dispersion of rays poured from an <span class="t20 hoverable">Eternal</span> Source, blazing
into galaxies, transfigured with ineffable auras. Again and again
I saw the creative beams condense into constellations, then resolve
into sheets of transparent flame. By rhythmic reversion, sextillion
worlds passed into diaphanous luster; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> became firmament.

I cognized the center of the empyrean as a point of intuitive
perception in my heart. Irradiating splendor issued from my nucleus
to every part of the universal structure. Blissful AMRITA, the
nectar of immortality, pulsed through me with a quicksilverlike
fluidity. The creative <span class="t23 hoverable">voice</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> I <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> resounding as AUM,
{FN14-1} the vibration of the Cosmic Motor.

Suddenly the breath returned to my lungs. With a disappointment
almost unbearable, I realized that my infinite immensity was lost.
Once more I was limited to the humiliating cage of a body, not
easily accommodative to the Spirit. Like a prodigal child, I had
run away from my macrocosmic home and imprisoned myself in a narrow
microcosm.

My guru was standing motionless before me; I started to drop at his
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">holy</span> feet in gratitude for the experience in cosmic <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span>
which I had <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> passionately sought. He held me upright, and spoke
calmly, unpretentiously.

"You must not get overdrunk with ecstasy. Much <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> remains
for you in the world. Come; let us sweep the balcony floor; then
we shall walk by the Ganges."

I fetched a broom; Master, I knew, was teaching me the secret of

balanced living. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> must stretch over the cosmogonic abysses,
while the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> performs its daily duties.

for a stroll, I was still entranced in unspeakable rapture. I saw
our bodies as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> astral pictures, moving over a road by the river

"It is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Spirit</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> that actively sustains every <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> and

blissful uncreated void beyond the worlds of vibratory phenomena,"
{FN14-2} <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> explained. "Saints who realize their divinity even
while in the <span class="t21 hoverable">flesh</span> know a similar twofold existence. Conscientiously
engaging in earthly work, they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> remain immersed in an inward

nevertheless expects that souls made in His image shall ultimately
rise above all <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> identifications and reunite with Him."

The cosmic vision <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> many permanent lessons. By daily stilling
my thoughts, I could win release from the delusive conviction that
my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> was a mass of <span class="t21 hoverable">flesh</span> and bones, traversing the hard soil of
matter. The breath and the restless mind, I saw, were like storms
which lashed the ocean of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> into waves of material forms-earth,
sky, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> beings, animals, birds, trees. No perception of the
Infinite as One <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Light</span> could be had except by calming those storms.
As often as I silenced the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> natural tumults, I beheld the

multitudinous waves of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span> melt into one lucent sea, even as
the waves of the ocean, their tempests subsiding, serenely dissolve
into unity.

A <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> bestows the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> experience of cosmic <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> when
his disciple, by meditation, has strengthened his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> to a degree
where the vast vistas <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> not overwhelm him. The experience
can never be given through one's mere intellectual willingness or
open-mindedness. Only adequate enlargement by yoga practice and
devotional BHAKTI can prepare the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> to absorb the liberating
shock of omnipresence. It comes with a natural inevitability to
the sincere devotee. His intense craving begins to pull at <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> with
an irresistible force. The Lord, as the Cosmic Vision, is drawn by
the seeker's magnetic ardor into his range of consciousness.

I wrote, in my later years, the following poem, "Samadhi," endeavoring
to convey the <span class="t0 t7 t21 t27 hoverable">glory</span> of its cosmic state:

Vanished the veils of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> and shade,
Lifted every vapor of sorrow,
Sailed away all dawns of fleeting joy,
Gone the dim sensory mirage.
Love, hate, health, disease, life, death,
Perished these false shadows on the screen of duality.
Waves of laughter, scyllas of sarcasm, melancholic whirlpools,

Melting in the vast sea of bliss.
The storm of MAYA stilled
By magic wand of intuition deep.
The universe, forgotten dream, subconsciously lurks,
Ready to invade my newly-wakened memory divine.
I live <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> the cosmic shadow,
But it is not, bereft of me;
As the sea exists <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> the waves,
But they breathe not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> the sea.
Dreams, wakings, states of deep TURIA sleep,
Present, past, future, no more for me,
But ever-present, all-flowing I, I, everywhere.
Planets, stars, stardust, earth,
Volcanic bursts of doomsday cataclysms,
Creation's molding furnace,
Glaciers of silent x-rays, burning electron floods,
Thoughts of all men, past, present, to come,
Every blade of grass, myself, mankind,
Each particle of universal dust,
Anger, greed, good, bad, salvation, lust,
I swallowed, transmuted all
Into a vast ocean of blood of my own one Being!
Smoldering joy, oft-puffed by <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span>
Blinding my tearful eyes,
Burst into immortal flames of bliss,

Consumed my tears, my frame, my all.
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thou</span> <span class="t2 t6 t8 t9 t10 t15 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">art</span> I, I am Thou,
Knowing, Knower, Known, as One!
Tranquilled, unbroken thrill, eternally living, ever-new peace!
Enjoyable beyond imagination of expectancy, SAMADHI bliss!
Not an unconscious <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span>
Or mental chloroform <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> wilful return,
SAMADHI but extends my conscious realm
Beyond limits of the mortal frame
To farthest boundary of eternity
Where I, the Cosmic Sea,
Watch the little ego floating in Me.
The sparrow, each grain of sand, fall not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> My sight.
All space floats like an iceberg in My mental sea.
Colossal Container, I, of all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> made.
By deeper, longer, thirsty, guru-given <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span>
Comes this celestial SAMADHI.
Mobile murmurs of atoms are heard,
The dark earth, mountains, vales, lo! molten liquid!
Flowing seas change into vapors of nebulae!
AUM blows <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> vapors, opening wondrously their veils,
Oceans stand revealed, shining electrons,
Till, at last sound of the cosmic drum,
Vanish the grosser lights into <span class="t20 hoverable">eternal</span> rays
Of all-pervading bliss.

From joy I came, for joy I live, in sacred joy I melt.
Ocean of mind, I drink all creation's waves.
Four veils of solid, liquid, vapor, light,
Lift aright.
Myself, in everything, enters the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Great</span> Myself.
Gone forever, fitful, flickering shadows of mortal memory.
Spotless is my mental sky, below, ahead, and <span class="t23 hoverable">high</span> above.
Eternity and I, one united ray.
A tiny bubble of laughter, I
Am become the Sea of Mirth Itself.

Sri Yukteswar taught me how to summon the <span class="t11 hoverable">blessed</span> experience at will,
and also how to transmit it to others if their intuitive channels
were developed. For months I entered the ecstatic union, comprehending
why the UPANISHADS say <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> is RASA, "the most relishable." One day,
however, I <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> a problem to Master.

"I want to know, sir-when shall I <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> God?"

"You have found Him."

"O no, sir, I don't think so!"

My guru was smiling. "I am sure you aren't expecting a venerable
Personage, adorning a throne in some antiseptic corner of the

cosmos! I see, however, that you are imagining that the possession
of miraculous powers is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of God. One might have the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span>

is not measured by one's outward powers, but only by the depth of
his bliss in meditation.

"EVER-NEW JOY IS GOD. He is inexhaustible; as you continue your
meditations during the years, He will beguile you with an infinite
ingenuity. Devotees like yourself who have found the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> never
dream of exchanging Him for any other happiness; He is seductive
beyond <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> of competition.

"How quickly we weary of earthly pleasures! <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">Desire</span> for material

one goal after another. The 'something else' he seeks is the Lord,
who alone can grant lasting joy.

"Outward longings drive us from the Eden within; they offer false
pleasures which only impersonate soul-happiness. The lost paradise
is quickly regained through <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> meditation. As <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> is unanticipatory
Ever-Newness, we never tire of Him. Can we be surfeited with bliss,
delightfully varied throughout eternity?"

"I understand now, sir, why saints <span class="t3 t11 t18 t27 hoverable">call</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> unfathomable. Even

"That is true; but He is also near and dear. After the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> has been
cleared by KRIYA YOGA of sensory obstacles, <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> furnishes
a twofold proof of God. Ever-new joy is evidence of His existence,
convincing to our very atoms. Also, in <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> one finds His
instant guidance, His adequate response to every difficulty."

"I see, Guruji; you have solved my problem." I smiled gratefully.
"I do realize now that I have found God, for whenever the joy of
<span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> has returned subconsciously during my active hours, I

CHAPTER: 15

THE CAULIFLOWER ROBBERY

"Master, a gift for you! These six huge cauliflowers were planted

with my hands; I have watched over their growth with the tender
care of a mother nursing her child." I presented the basket of
vegetables with a ceremonial flourish.

"Thank you!" Sri Yukteswar's smile was warm with appreciation.
"Please keep them in your room; I shall need them tomorrow for a
special dinner."

I had just arrived in Puri {FN15-1} to spend my college summer
vacation with my guru at his seaside hermitage. Built by <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span>
and his disciples, the cheerful little two-storied retreat fronts
on the Bay of Bengal.

I awoke early the following morning, refreshed by the salty sea
breezes and the charm of my surroundings. Sri Yukteswar's melodious
<span class="t23 hoverable">voice</span> was calling; I <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> a look at my cherished cauliflowers and
stowed them neatly under my bed.

"Come, let us go to the beach." <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> led the way; several young
disciples and myself followed in a scattered group. Our guru surveyed
us in mild criticism.

"When our Western brothers walk, they usually <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> pride in unison.
Now, please march in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> rows; keep rhythmic step with one another."
Sri Yukteswar watched as we obeyed; he began to sing: "Boys go to

and fro, in a pretty little row." I could not but admire the ease
with which <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> was able to match the brisk pace of his young
students.

"Halt!" My guru's <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> sought mine. "Did you remember to lock the
back door of the hermitage?"

[Illustration: MY GURU'S SEASIDE HERMITAGE AT PURI A steady stream
of visitors poured from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> into the hermitage tranquillity.
A <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> of learned <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> came with the expectation of meeting an
orthodox religionist. A supercilious smile or a glance of amused
tolerance occasionally betreayed that the newcomers anticipated
nothing more than a few pious platitudes. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> their reluctant
departure <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> an expressed conviction that Sri Yukteswar had
shown precise insight into their specialized fields of knowledge.
My guru always had young resident disciples in his hermitage.
He directed their minds and lives with that careful discipline in
which the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> "disciple" is etymologically rooted.--see puri.jpg]

"I think so, sir."

Sri Yukteswar was silent for a few minutes, a half-suppressed smile
on his lips. "No, you forgot," he said finally. "Divine contemplation
must not be made an excuse for material carelessness. You have
neglected your duty in safeguarding the ashram; you must be punished."

I <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> he was obscurely joking when he added: "Your six cauliflowers
will soon be only five."

We turned around at Master's orders and marched back until we were
close to the hermitage.

"Rest awhile. Mukunda, look across the compound on our left; observe
the road beyond. A certain <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> will arrive there presently; he will
be the means of your chastisement."

I concealed my vexation at these incomprehensible remarks. A peasant
soon appeared on the road; he was dancing grotesquely and flinging
his arms about with meaningless gestures. Almost paralyzed with
curiosity, I glued my <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> on the hilarious spectacle. As the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span>
reached a point in the road where he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> vanish from our view,
Sri Yukteswar said, "Now, he will return."

The peasant at once changed his direction and made for the rear
of the ashram. Crossing a sandy tract, he entered the building by
the back door. I had <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> it unlocked, even as my guru had said.
The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> emerged shortly, holding one of my prized cauliflowers. He
now strode along respectably, invested with the dignity of possession.

The unfolding farce, in which my role appeared to be that of bewildered

victim, was not so disconcerting that I failed in indignant pursuit.
I was halfway to the road when <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> recalled me. He was shaking
from <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> to foot with laughter.

"That poor crazy <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> has been longing for a cauliflower," he explained
between outbursts of mirth. "I <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> idea if
he got one of yours, so ill-guarded!"

I dashed to my room, where I found that the thief, evidently one
with a vegetable fixation, had <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> untouched my gold rings, watch,
and money, all lying openly on the blanket. He had crawled instead
under the bed where, completely hidden from casual sight, one of
my cauliflowers had aroused his singlehearted desire.

I asked Sri Yukteswar that evening to explain the incident which
had, I thought, a few baffling features.

My guru shook his <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> slowly. "You will understand it someday.
Science will soon discover a few of these hidden laws."

When the wonders of radio burst some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> later on an astounded
world, I remembered Master's prediction. Age-old concepts of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span>
and space were annihilated; no peasant's home so narrow that London
or Calcutta could not enter! The dullest <span class="t14 t24 hoverable">intelligence</span> enlarged
before indisputable proof of one aspect of man's omnipresence.

The "plot" of the cauliflower comedy can be best understood by a
radio analogy. Sri Yukteswar was a perfect <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> radio. Thoughts
are no more than very gentle vibrations moving in the ether. Just
as a sensitized radio picks up a desired musical <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> out of
thousands of other programs from every direction, so my guru had
been able to catch the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> of the half-witted <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> who hankered
for a cauliflower, out of the countless thoughts of broadcasting
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> wills in the world. {FN15-2} By his powerful will, <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> was
also a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> broadcasting station, and had successfully directed
the peasant to reverse his steps and go to a certain room for a
single cauliflower.

Intuition {FN15-3} is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> guidance, appearing naturally in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> during
those instants when his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> is calm. Nearly everyone has had the
experience of an inexplicably correct "hunch," or has transferred
his thoughts effectively to another person.

The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> mind, <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> from the static of restlessness, can perform
through its antenna of intuition all the functions of complicated
radio mechanisms-sending and receiving thoughts, and tuning out
undesirable ones. As the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of a radio depends on the amount of
electrical current it can utilize, so the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> radio is energized

All thoughts vibrate eternally in the cosmos. By deep concentration, a
<span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> is able to detect the thoughts of any mind, living or dead.
Thoughts are universally and not individually rooted; a <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span>
cannot be created, but only perceived. The erroneous thoughts of
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> result from imperfections in his discernment. The goal of yoga
science is to calm the mind, that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> distortion it may mirror

Radio and television have <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> the instantaneous sound and sight
of remote persons to the firesides of millions: the first faint
scientific intimations that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> is an all-pervading spirit. Not
a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> confined to a point in space, but the vast soul, which the
ego in most barbaric modes conspires in vain to cramp.

"Very strange, very wonderful, seemingly very improbable phenomena
may <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> appear which, when once established, will not astonish us
more than we are now astonished at all that science has taught us
during the last century," Charles Robert Richet, Nobel Prizeman in
physiology, has declared. "It is assumed that the phenomena which
we now accept <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> surprise, do not excite our astonishment
because they are understood. But this is not the case. If they do
not surprise us it is not because they are understood, it is because
they are familiar; for if that which is not understood ought to
surprise us, we should be surprised at everything-the fall of a
stone thrown into the air, the acorn which becomes an oak, mercury

which expands when it is heated, iron attracted by a magnet,
phosphorus which burns when it is rubbed. . . . The science of
today is a <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> matter; the revolutions and evolutions which it
will experience in a hundred <span class="t15 t23 hoverable">thousand</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> will far exceed the
most daring anticipations. The truths-those surprising, amazing,
unforeseen truths-which our descendants will discover, are even
now all around us, staring us in the eyes, so to speak, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span>
we do not see them. But it is not enough to say that we do not see
them; we do not wish to see them; for as soon as an unexpected and
unfamiliar <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> appears, we try to fit it into the framework of
the commonplaces of acquired knowledge, and we are indignant that
anyone should dare to experiment further."

A humorous occurrence <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> a few <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">days</span> after I had been so
implausibly robbed of a cauliflower. A certain kerosene lamp could
not be found. Having so lately witnessed my guru's omniscient
insight, I <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> demonstrate that it was child's play
to locate the lamp.

<span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> perceived my expectation. With exaggerated gravity he
questioned all ashram residents. A young disciple confessed that
he had <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> the lamp to go to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> in the back yard.

Sri Yukteswar gave the solemn counsel: "Seek the lamp near the
well."

I rushed there; no lamp! Crestfallen, I returned to my guru. He
was now laughing heartily, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> compunction for my disillusionment.

"Too bad I couldn't direct you to the vanished lamp; I am not a
fortune teller!" With twinkling eyes, he added, "I am not even a
satisfactory Sherlock Holmes!"

I realized that <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> never display his powers when challenged,
or for a triviality.

Delightful weeks sped by. Sri Yukteswar was planning a religious
procession. He asked me to lead the disciples over the town and
beach of Puri. The festive <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> dawned as one of the hottest of the
summer.

"Guruji, how can I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> the barefooted students over the fiery
sands?" I spoke despairingly.

"I will tell you a secret," <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> responded. "The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> will send
an umbrella of clouds; you all shall walk in comfort."

I happily organized the procession; our group started from the
ashram with a SAT-SANGA banner. {FN15-4} Designed by Sri Yukteswar,
it bore the symbol of the single {FN15-5} eye, the telescopic gaze

of intuition.

No sooner had we <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> the hermitage than the part of the sky which
was overhead became filled with clouds as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> by magic. To the
accompaniment of astonished ejaculations from all sides, a very
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> shower fell, cooling the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">city</span> streets and the burning seashore.
The soothing drops descended during the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> hours of the parade.
The exact instant at which our group returned to the ashram, the
clouds and rain passed away tracelessly.

"You see how <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> feels for us," <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> replied after I had expressed
my gratitude. "The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> responds to all and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> for all. Just as
He sent rain at my plea, so He fulfills any sincere <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> of the
devotee. Seldom do <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> realize how often <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> heeds their prayers.
He is not partial to a few, but listens to everyone who approaches
Him trustingly. His <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">children</span> should ever have implicit <span class="t4 t7 t12 t16 hoverable">faith</span> in
the loving-kindness of their Omnipresent Father." {FN15-6}

Sri Yukteswar sponsored four yearly festivals, at the equinoxes
and solstices, when his students gathered from far and near. The
winter solstice celebration was held in Serampore; the first one
I attended <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> me with a permanent blessing.

The festivities started in the morning with a barefoot procession
along the streets. The voices of a hundred students rang out with

sweet religious songs; a few musicians played the flute and KHOL
KARTAL (drums and cymbals). Enthusiastic townspeople strewed the
path with flowers, glad to be summoned from prosaic tasks by our
resounding praise of the Lord's <span class="t11 hoverable">blessed</span> name. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> tour ended
in the courtyard of the hermitage. There we encircled our guru,
while students on upper balconies showered us with marigold blossoms.

Many guests <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> upstairs to receive a pudding of CHANNA and
oranges. I made my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> to a group of brother disciples who were
serving today as cooks. <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">Food</span> for such large gatherings had to
be cooked outdoors in huge cauldrons. The improvised wood-burning
brick stoves were smoky and tear-provoking, but we laughed merrily
at our work. Religious festivals in India are never considered
troublesome; each one does his part, supplying money, rice,
vegetables, or his personal services.

<span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> was soon in our midst, supervising the details of the feast.
Busy every moment, he kept pace with the most energetic young
student.

A SANKIRTAN (group chanting), accompanied by the harmonium and
hand-played Indian drums, was in progress on the <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> floor. Sri
Yukteswar listened appreciatively; his musical <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> was acutely
perfect.

"They are off key!" <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> the cooks and joined the artists.
The melody was <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> again, this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> correctly rendered.

In India, music as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as painting and the drama is considered a

first musicians. The <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Dancer Shiva is scripturally represented
as having worked out the infinite modes of rhythm in His cosmic
dance of universal creation, preservation, and dissolution, while
Brahma accentuated the time-beat with the clanging cymbals, and
Vishnu sounded the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">holy</span> MRIDANGA or drum. Krishna, an incarnation
of Vishnu, is always shown in Hindu <span class="t2 t6 t8 t9 t10 t15 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">art</span> with a flute, on which
he plays the enrapturing song that recalls to their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> home the

is symbolized as performing on the VINA, mother of all stringed
instruments. The SAMA VEDA of India contains the world's earliest
writings on musical science.

The foundation stone of Hindu music is the RAGAS or fixed melodic
scales. The six basic RAGAS branch out into 126 derivative RAGINIS
(wives) and PUTRAS (sons). Each RAGA has a minimum of five notes:
a leading <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">note</span> (VADI or king), a secondary <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">note</span> (SAMAVADI or prime
minister), helping notes (ANUVADI, attendants), and a dissonant
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">note</span> (VIVADI, the enemy).

Each one of the six basic RAGAS has a natural correspondence with

a certain hour of the day, season of the year, and a presiding
deity who bestows a particular potency. Thus, (1) the HINDOLE RAGA
is <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> only at dawn in the spring, to evoke the mood of universal
love; (2) DEEPAKA RAGA is played during the evening in summer, to
arouse compassion; (3) MEGHA RAGA is a melody for midday in the
rainy season, to summon courage; (4) BHAIRAVA RAGA is played in the
mornings of August, September, October, to achieve tranquillity;
(5) SRI RAGA is reserved for autumn twilights, to attain pure love;
(6) MALKOUNSA RAGA is <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> at midnights in winter, for valor.

The ancient rishis discovered these laws of sound alliance between
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> and man. Because <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> is an objectification of AUM,
the Primal Sound or Vibratory Word, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> can obtain control over
all natural manifestations through the <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> of certain MANTRAS or
chants. {FN15-7} Historical documents tell of the remarkable powers
possessed by Miyan Tan Sen, sixteenth century court musician for
Akbar the Great. Commanded by the Emperor to sing a night RAGA
while the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> was overhead, Tan Sen intoned a MANTRA which instantly
caused the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> palace precincts to become enveloped in darkness.

Indian music divides the octave into 22 SRUTIS or demi-semitones.
These microtonal intervals permit fine shades of musical expression
unattainable by the Western chromatic scale of 12 semitones. Each
one of the seven basic notes of the octave is associated in Hindu
mythology with a color, and the natural cry of a bird or beast-DO

with green, and the peacock; RE with red, and the skylark; MI with
golden, and the goat; FA with yellowish white, and the heron; SOL
with black, and the nightingale; LA with yellow, and the horse; SI
with a combination of all colors, and the elephant.

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Three</span> scales-major, harmonic minor, melodic minor-are the only
ones which Occidental music employs, but Indian music outlines 72
THATAS or scales. The musician has a creative scope for endless
improvisation around the fixed traditional melody or RAGA; he
concentrates on the sentiment or definitive mood of the structural
theme and then embroiders it to the limits of his own originality.
The Hindu musician does not read <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> notes; he clothes anew at each
playing the bare skeleton of the RAGA, often confining himself to
a single melodic sequence, stressing by repetition all its subtle
microtonal and rhythmic variations. Bach, among Western composers,
had an understanding of the charm and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of repetitious sound
slightly differentiated in a hundred complex ways.

Ancient Sanskrit literature describes 120 TALAS or time-measures.
The traditional founder of Hindu music, Bharata, is said to have
isolated 32 kinds of TALA in the song of a lark. The origin of TALA
or rhythm is rooted in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> movements-the double <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of walking,
and the triple <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of respiration in sleep, when inhalation is
twice the length of exhalation. India has always recognized the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t23 hoverable">voice</span> as the most perfect instrument of sound. Hindu music

therefore largely confines itself to the <span class="t23 hoverable">voice</span> range of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span>
octaves. For the same reason, melody (relation of successive notes)
is stressed, rather than harmony (relation of simultaneous notes).

The deeper aim of the early rishi-musicians was to blend the singer
with the Cosmic Song which can be <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> through awakening of man's
occult spinal centers. Indian music is a subjective, spiritual,
and individualistic art, aiming not at symphonic brilliance but at
personal harmony with the Oversoul. The Sanskrit <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> for musician
is BHAGAVATHAR, "he who sings the praises of God." The SANKIRTANS
or musical gatherings are an effective <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of yoga or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span>
discipline, necessitating deep concentration, intense absorption
in the seed <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> and sound. Because <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> himself is an expression
of the Creative Word, sound has the most potent and immediate effect
on him, <span class="t22 t23 t28 hoverable">offering</span> a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> to remembrance of his <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> origin.

The SANKIRTAN issuing from Sri Yukteswar's second-story sitting
room on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> of the festival was inspiring to the cooks amidst
the steaming pots. My brother disciples and I joyously sang the
refrains, beating <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> with our hands.

By sunset we had served our hundreds of visitors with KHICHURI (rice
and lentils), vegetable curry, and rice pudding. We laid cotton
blankets over the courtyard; soon the assemblage was squatting
under the starry vault, quietly attentive to the <span class="t12 t20 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">wisdom</span> pouring from

Sri Yukteswar's lips. His public speeches emphasized the value of
KRIYA YOGA, and a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of self-respect, calmness, determination,
simple diet, and regular exercise.

A group of very young disciples then chanted a few sacred hymns; the
meeting concluded with SANKIRTAN. From ten o'clock until midnight,
the ashram residents washed pots and pans, and cleared the courtyard.
My guru <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> me to his side.

"I am pleased over your cheerful labors today and during the past
week of preparations. I want you with me; you may sleep in my bed
tonight."

This was a privilege I had never <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> fall to my lot. We
sat awhile in a <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of intense <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> tranquillity. Hardly ten
minutes after we had gotten into bed, <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> rose and began to
dress.

"What is the matter, sir?" I felt a tinge of unreality in the
unexpected joy of sleeping beside my guru.

"I think that a few students who missed their proper train connections
will be here soon. Let us have some <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> ready."

"Guruji, no one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> come at one o'clock in the morning!"

"Stay in bed; you have been working very hard. But I am going to
cook."

At Sri Yukteswar's resolute tone, I jumped up and followed him to
the small daily-used kitchen adjacent to the second-floor inner
balcony. Rice and DHAL were soon boiling.

My guru smiled affectionately. "Tonight you have conquered fatigue
and <span class="t28 hoverable">fear</span> of hard work; you shall never be bothered by them in the
future."

As he uttered these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> of lifelong blessing, footsteps sounded
in the courtyard. I ran downstairs and admitted a group of students.

"Dear brother, how reluctant we are to disturb <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> at this hour!"
One <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> addressed me apologetically. "We made a mistake about train
schedules, but felt we could not return home <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> a glimpse of
our guru."

"He has been expecting you and is even now preparing your food."

Sri Yukteswar's welcoming <span class="t23 hoverable">voice</span> rang out; I led the astonished
visitors to the kitchen. <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> turned to me with twinkling eyes.

"Now that you have finished comparing notes, no doubt you are
satisfied that our guests really did miss their train!"

I followed him to his bedroom a half hour later, realizing fully
that I was about to sleep beside a godlike guru.

{FN15-1} Puri, about 310 miles south of Calcutta, is a famous
pilgrimage <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">city</span> for devotees of Krishna; his worship is celebrated

invisible rays which really travel from one <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> to another. The

lengths of these rays range from shorter than anything now <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span>
in broadcasting to the longest kind of radio waves. The jumble of
these rays is almost inconceivable. There are millions of them. A
single very large molecule may give off 1,000,000 different wave
lengths at the same time. The longer wave lengths of this sort
travel with the ease and speed of radio waves. . . . There is one
amazing difference between the new radio rays and familiar rays
like light. This is the prolonged time, amounting to thousands of
years, which these radio waves will keep on emitting from undisturbed

"Astrology is the study of man's response to planetary stimuli.
The stars have no conscious benevolence or animosity; they merely
send forth positive and negative radiations. Of themselves, these
do not help or harm humanity, but offer a lawful channel for the
outward operation of cause-effect equilibriums which each <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> has

"A child is <span class="t16 t24 hoverable">born</span> on that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> and at that hour when the celestial
rays are in mathematical harmony with his individual karma. His
horoscope is a challenging portrait, revealing his unalterable
past and its probable future results. But the natal chart can be
rightly interpreted only by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> of intuitive wisdom: these are few.

"The message boldly blazoned across the heavens at the moment
of birth is not meant to emphasize fate-the result of past <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span>
and evil-but to arouse man's will to escape from his universal
thralldom. What he has done, he can undo. None other than himself
was the instigator of the causes of whatever effects are now
prevalent in his life. He can overcome any limitation, because he
<span class="t16 hoverable">created</span> it by his own actions in the first place, and because he
has <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> resources which are not subject to planetary pressure.

"Superstitious awe of astrology makes one an automaton, slavishly
dependent on mechanical guidance. The <span class="t8 t12 t17 hoverable">wise</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> defeats his

from the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span> to the Creator. The more he realizes his unity
with Spirit, the less he can be dominated by matter. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> is

"Man IS a soul, and HAS a body. When he properly places his <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span>
of identity, he leaves behind all compulsive patterns. So <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> as

will know the subtle fetters of environmental law.

"God is harmony; the devotee who attunes himself will never perform
any action amiss. His activities will be correctly and naturally timed
to accord with astrological law. After deep prayer and <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span>
he is in touch with his <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> consciousness; there is no greater

"Then, dear Master, why do you want me to wear an astrological
bangle?" I ventured this question after a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> silence, during
which I had tried to assimilate Sri Yukteswar's noble exposition.

"It is only when a traveler has reached his goal that he is justified

in discarding his maps. During the journey, he takes advantage of
any convenient short cut. The ancient rishis discovered many ways
to curtail the period of man's exile in delusion. There are certain
mechanical features in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">law</span> of karma which can be skillfully
adjusted by the fingers of wisdom.

"All <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> ills arise from some transgression of universal law.
The scriptures point out that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> must satisfy the laws of nature,
while not discrediting the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> omnipotence. He should say: 'Lord,
I trust in Thee, and know <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thou</span> canst help me, but I too will do
my best to undo any wrong I have done.' By a <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> of means-by
prayer, by will power, by yoga meditation, by consultation with
saints, by <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> of astrological bangles-the adverse effects of past
wrongs can be minimized or nullified.

"Just as a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> can be fitted with a copper rod to absorb the
shock of lightning, so the bodily temple can be benefited by various
protective measures. Ages ago our yogis discovered that pure metals
emit an astral <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> which is powerfully counteractive to negative
pulls of the planets. Subtle electrical and magnetic radiations
are constantly circulating in the universe; when a man's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> is
being aided, he does not know it; when it is being disintegrated,
he is still in ignorance. Can he do anything about it?

"This problem received attention from our rishis; they found helpful

not only a combination of metals, but also of plants and-most
effective of all-faultless jewels of not less than <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> carats. The
preventive uses of astrology have seldom been seriously studied
outside of India. One little-known <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> is that the proper jewels,
metals, or plant preparations are valueless unless the required
weight is secured, and unless these remedial agents are worn next
to the skin."

"Sir, of course I shall <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> your advice and get a bangle. I am
intrigued at the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> of outwitting a planet!"

"For general purposes I counsel the <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> of an armlet made of gold,
silver, and copper. But for a specific purpose I want you to get
one of silver and lead." Sri Yukteswar added careful directions.

"Guruji, what 'specific purpose' do you mean?"

"The stars are about to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> an unfriendly interest in you, Mukunda.
<span class="t28 hoverable">Fear</span> not; you shall be protected. In about a month your liver will
cause you much trouble. The illness is scheduled to last for six
months, but your <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> of an astrological armlet will shorten the
period to twenty-four days."

I sought out a jeweler the next day, and was soon wearing the
bangle. My health was excellent; Master's prediction slipped from

my mind. He <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> Serampore to visit Benares. Thirty <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">days</span> after our
conversation, I felt a sudden pain in the region of my liver. The
following weeks were a nightmare of excruciating pain. Reluctant
to disturb my guru, I <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> bravely endure my trial alone.

But twenty-three <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">days</span> of torture weakened my resolution; I entrained
for Benares. There Sri Yukteswar greeted me with unusual warmth,
but gave me no opportunity to tell him my woes in private. Many
devotees visited <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> that day, just for a DARSHAN. {FN16-2}
Ill and neglected, I sat in a corner. It was not until after the
evening meal that all guests had departed. My guru summoned me to
the octagonal balcony of the house.

"You must have come about your liver disorder." Sri Yukteswar's
gaze was averted; he walked to and fro, occasionally intercepting
the moonlight. "Let me see; you have been ailing for twenty-four
days, haven't you?"

"Yes, sir."

"Please do the stomach exercise I have taught you."

"If you knew the extent of my suffering, Master, you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> not ask
me to exercise." Nevertheless I made a feeble attempt to obey him.

"You say you have pain; I say you have none. How can such contradictions
exist?" My guru looked at me inquiringly.

I was dazed and then overcome with joyful relief. No longer could
I feel the continuous torment that had kept me nearly sleepless
for weeks; at Sri Yukteswar's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> the agony vanished as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span>
it had never been.

I started to kneel at his feet in gratitude, but he quickly prevented
me.

"Don't be childish. Get up and enjoy the beauty of the moon over
the Ganges." But Master's <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> were twinkling happily as I stood
in silence beside him. I understood by his attitude that he wanted
me to feel that not he, but God, had been the Healer.

I wear even now the heavy silver and lead bangle, a memento of that
day-long-past, ever-cherished-when I found anew that I was living
with a personage indeed superhuman. On later occasions, when
I <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> my friends to Sri Yukteswar for healing, he invariably
recommended jewels or the bangle, extolling their <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> as an act of
astrological wisdom.

I had been prejudiced against astrology from my childhood, partly
because I observed that many <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> are sequaciously attached to it,

and partly because of a prediction made by our family astrologer:
"You will marry <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> times, being twice a widower." I brooded
over the matter, feeling like a goat awaiting <span class="t2 t9 t10 t16 t18 t19 t27 t28 hoverable">sacrifice</span> before the
temple of triple matrimony.

"You may as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> be resigned to your fate," my brother Ananta had
remarked. "Your <span class="t0 t11 t24 hoverable">written</span> horoscope has correctly stated that you
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> fly from home toward the Himalayas during your early years,
but <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be forcibly returned. The forecast of your marriages is
also bound to be true."

A clear intuition came to me one night that the prophecy was wholly
false. I <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> to the horoscope scroll, placing the ashes in a
paper bag on which I wrote: "Seeds of past karma cannot germinate
if they are roasted in the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> fires of wisdom." I put the bag
in a conspicuous spot; Ananta immediately read my defiant comment.

"You cannot destroy <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> as easily as you have burnt this paper
scroll." My brother laughed scornfully.

It is a <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> occasions before I reached manhood, my
family tried to arrange my betrothal. Each <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> I refused to fall
in with the plans, {FN16-3} knowing that my <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t8 t13 t15 t17 t18 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> was more
overwhelming than any astrological persuasion from the past.

"The deeper the self-realization of a man, the more he influences
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> universe by his subtle <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> vibrations, and the
less he himself is affected by the phenomenal flux." These <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span>
of Master's often returned inspiringly to my mind.

Occasionally I told astrologers to select my worst periods, according
to planetary indications, and I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> still accomplish whatever
task I <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> myself. It is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> that my success at such times has
been accompanied by extraordinary difficulties. But my conviction
has always been justified: <span class="t4 t7 t12 t16 hoverable">faith</span> in the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> protection, and the
right <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> of man's God-given will, are forces formidable beyond
any the "inverted bowl" can muster.

The starry inscription at one's birth, I came to understand, is not
that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> is a puppet of his past. Its message is rather a prod to
pride; the very heavens seek to arouse man's determination to be
<span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> from every limitation. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> <span class="t16 hoverable">created</span> each <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> as a soul, dowered
with individuality, hence essential to the universal structure,
<span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> in the temporary role of pillar or parasite. His freedom
is final and immediate, if he so wills; it depends not on outer
but inner victories.

Sri Yukteswar discovered the mathematical application of a 24,000-year
equinoctial cycle to our present age. {FN16-4} The cycle is divided
into an Ascending Arc and a Descending Arc, each of 12,000 years.

Within each Arc fall four YUGAS or Ages, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> KALI, DWAPARA,
TRETA, and SATYA, corresponding to the Greek ideas of Iron, Bronze,
Silver, and Golden Ages.

My guru determined by various calculations that the last KALI YUGA
or Iron Age, of the Ascending Arc, started about A.D. 500. The Iron
Age, 1200 <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> in duration, is a span of materialism; it ended
about A.D. 1700. That year ushered in DWAPARA YUGA, a 2400-year
period of electrical and atomic-energy developments, the age of
telegraph, radio, airplanes, and other space-annihilators.

The 3600-year period of TRETA YUGA will start in A.D. 4100; its

A descending arc of 12,000 years, starting with a descending
Golden Age of 4800 years, then begins {FN16-5} for the world; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span>
gradually sinks into ignorance. These cycles are the <span class="t20 hoverable">eternal</span> rounds
of MAYA, the contrasts and relativities of the phenomenal universe.
{FN16-6} Man, one by one, escapes from creation's prison of duality

from the truths as originally expressed by the prophets.

"Fix one's vision on the end of the nose." This inaccurate
interpretation of a BHAGAVAD GITA stanza, {FN16-7} widely accepted
by Eastern pundits and Western translators, <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> to arouse Master's

"The Adam and Eve story is incomprehensible to me!" I observed with
considerable heat one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> in my early struggles with the allegory.
"Why did <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> punish not only the guilty pair, but also the innocent

<span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> was more amused by my vehemence than my ignorance. "GENESIS

he explained. "Its 'tree of life' is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> body. The spinal
cord is like an upturned tree, with man's hair as its roots, and
afferent and efferent nerves as branches. The tree of the nervous
system bears many enjoyable fruits, or sensations of sight, sound,

he was forbidden the experience of sex, the 'apple' at the center
of the bodily garden. {FN16-14}

"The 'serpent' represents the coiled-up spinal energy which stimulates
the sex nerves. 'Adam' is reason, and 'Eve' is feeling. When the
emotion or Eve-consciousness in any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> being is overpowered by

SASI AND THE <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">THREE</span> SAPPHIRES

"Because you and my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> think so highly of Swami Sri Yukteswar,
I will <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> a look at him." The tone of <span class="t23 hoverable">voice</span> <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> by Dr. Narayan
Chunder Roy implied that he was humoring the whim of half-wits. I
concealed my indignation, in the best traditions of the proselyter.

My companion, a veterinary surgeon, was a confirmed agnostic. His
young <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> Santosh had implored me to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> an interest in his father.
So far my invaluable aid had been a bit on the invisible side.

Dr. Roy accompanied me the following <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> to the Serampore hermitage.
After <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> had granted him a brief interview, marked for the most
part by stoic silence on both sides, the visitor brusquely departed.

"Why <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> a dead <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> to the ashram?" Sri Yukteswar looked at me
inquiringly as soon as the door had closed on the Calcutta skeptic.

"Sir! The doctor is very much alive!"

"But in a short <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> he will be dead."

I was shocked. "Sir, this will be a terrible blow to his son. Santosh
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> hopes for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> to change his father's materialistic views. I
beseech you, Master, to help the man."

"Very well; for your sake." My guru's face was impassive. "The
proud horse doctor is far gone in diabetes, although he does not
know it. In fifteen <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">days</span> he will <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> to his bed. The physicians
will give him up for lost; his natural <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> to leave this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> is
six weeks from today. Due to your intercession, however, on that
date he will recover. But there is one condition. You must get
him to wear an astrological bangle; he will doubtless <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> as
violently as one of his horses before an operation!" <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> chuckled.

After a silence, during which I wondered how Santosh and I could
best employ the arts of cajolery on the recalcitrant doctor, Sri
Yukteswar made further disclosures.

"As soon as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> gets well, advise him not to <span class="t28 hoverable">eat</span> meat. He will

not heed this counsel, however, and in six months, just as he is
feeling at his best, he will drop dead. Even that six-month extension
of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> is granted him only because of your plea."

The following <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> I suggested to Santosh that he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> an armlet
at the jeweler's. It was ready in a week, but Dr. Roy refused to
put it on.

"I am in the best of health. You will never impress me with these
astrological superstitions." The doctor glanced at me belligerently.

I recalled with amusement that <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> had justifiably compared
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> to a balky horse. Another seven <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">days</span> passed; the doctor,
suddenly ill, meekly consented to wear the bangle. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Two</span> weeks later
the physician in attendance told me that his patient's <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> was
hopeless. He supplied harrowing details of the ravages inflicted
by diabetes.

I shook my head. "My guru has said that, after a sickness lasting
one month, Dr. Roy will be well."

The physician stared at me incredulously. But he sought me out a
fortnight later, with an apologetic air.

"Dr. Roy has made a complete recovery!" he exclaimed. "It is the

most amazing <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> in my experience. Never before have I seen a dying
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> show such an inexplicable comeback. Your guru must indeed be
a healing prophet!"

After one interview with Dr. Roy, during which I repeated Sri
Yukteswar's advice about a meatless diet, I did not see the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span>
again for six months. He stopped for a chat one evening as I sat
on the piazza of my family home on Gurpar Road.

"Tell your teacher that by eating meat frequently, I have wholly
regained my strength. His unscientific ideas on diet have not
influenced me." It was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> that Dr. Roy looked a picture of health.

But the next <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> Santosh came running to me from his home on the
next block. "This morning <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Father</span> dropped dead!"

This <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> was one of my strangest experiences with Master. He
healed the rebellious veterinary surgeon in spite of his disbelief,
and extended the man's natural term on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> by six months, just
because of my earnest supplication. Sri Yukteswar was boundless in
his kindness when confronted by the urgent prayer of a devotee.

It was my proudest privilege to <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> college friends to meet my
guru. Many of them <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> lay aside-at least in the ashram!-their
fashionable academic cloak of religious skepticism.

One of my friends, Sasi, spent a <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> of happy week ends in
Serampore. <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> became immensely fond of the boy, and lamented
that his private <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> was wild and disorderly.

"Sasi, unless you reform, one year hence you will be dangerously
ill." Sri Yukteswar gazed at my friend with affectionate exasperation.
"Mukunda is the witness: don't say later that I didn't warn you."

Sasi laughed. "Master, I will leave it to you to interest a sweet
charity of cosmos in my own sad case! My <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> is willing but my
will is weak. You are my only savior on earth; I believe in nothing
else."

"At least you should wear a two-carat blue sapphire. It will help
you."

"I can't afford one. Anyhow, dear guruji, if trouble comes, I fully
believe you will protect me."

"In a year you will <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> sapphires," Sri Yukteswar replied
cryptically. "They will be of no <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> then."

Variations on this conversation <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> regularly. "I can't
reform!" Sasi <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> say in comical despair. "And my trust in you,

Master, is more precious to me than any stone!"

A year later I was visiting my guru at the Calcutta home of his
disciple, Naren Babu. About ten o'clock in the morning, as Sri
Yukteswar and I were sitting quietly in the second-floor parlor,
I <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> the front door open. <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> straightened stiffly.

"It is that Sasi," he remarked gravely. "The year is now up; both
his lungs are gone. He has ignored my counsel; tell him I don't
want to see him."

Half stunned by Sri Yukteswar's sternness, I raced down the stairway.
Sasi was ascending.

"O Mukunda! I do hope <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> is here; I had a hunch he might be."

"Yes, but he doesn't wish to be disturbed."

Sasi burst into tears and brushed past me. He threw himself at Sri
Yukteswar's feet, placing there <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> beautiful sapphires.

"Omniscient guru, the doctors say I have galloping tuberculosis!
They give me no longer than <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> more months! I humbly implore
your aid; I know you can heal me!"

"Isn't it a bit late now to be worrying over your life? Depart
with your jewels; their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of usefulness is past." <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> then
sat sphinxlike in an unrelenting silence, punctuated by the boy's
sobs for mercy.

An intuitive conviction came to me that Sri Yukteswar was merely
testing the depth of Sasi's <span class="t4 t7 t12 t16 hoverable">faith</span> in the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> healing power. I was
not surprised a tense hour later when <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> turned a sympathetic
gaze on my prostrate friend.

"Get up, Sasi; what a commotion you make in other people's houses!
Return your sapphires to the jeweler's; they are an unnecessary
expense now. But get an astrological bangle and wear it. <span class="t28 hoverable">Fear</span> not;
in a few weeks you shall be well."

Sasi's smile illumined his tear-marred face like sudden <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> over
a sodden landscape. "Beloved guru, shall I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> the medicines
prescribed by the doctors?"

Sri Yukteswar's glance was longanimous. "Just as you wish-drink
them or discard them; it does not matter. It is more possible for
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> and moon to interchange their positions than for you to
die of tuberculosis." He added abruptly, "Go now, before I change
my mind!"

With an agitated bow, my friend hastily departed. I visited him
several times during the next few weeks, and was aghast to <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span>
his condition increasingly worse.

"Sasi cannot last through the night." These <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> from his physician,
and the spectacle of my friend, now reduced almost to a skeleton,
sent me posthaste to Serampore. My guru listened coldly to my
tearful report.

"Why do you come here to bother me? You have already <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> me assure
Sasi of his recovery."

I bowed before him in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> awe, and retreated to the door. Sri
Yukteswar said no parting word, but sank into silence, his unwinking
<span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> half-open, their vision fled to another world.

I returned at once to Sasi's home in Calcutta. With astonishment
I found my friend sitting up, drinking milk.

"O Mukunda! What a miracle! Four hours ago I felt Master's presence
in the room; my terrible symptoms immediately disappeared. I feel
that through his grace I am entirely well."

In a few weeks Sasi was stouter and in better health than ever
before. {FN17-1} But his singular reaction to his healing had an

ungrateful tinge: he seldom visited Sri Yukteswar again! My friend
told me one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> that he so deeply regretted his previous mode of
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> that he was ashamed to face Master.

I could only conclude that Sasi's illness had had the contrasting
effect of stiffening his will and impairing his manners.

The first <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> of my course at Scottish Church College were
drawing to a close. My classroom attendance had been very spasmodic;
what little studying I did was only to keep <span class="t13 hoverable">peace</span> with my family.
My <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> private tutors came regularly to my house; I was regularly
absent: I can discern at least this one regularity in my scholastic
career!

In India <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> successful <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> of college <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> an Intermediate Arts
diploma; the student may then look forward to another <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span>
and his A.B. degree.

The Intermediate Arts final examinations loomed ominously ahead.
I fled to Puri, where my guru was spending a few weeks. Vaguely
hoping that he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> sanction my nonappearance at the finals, I
related my embarrassing unpreparedness.

But <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> smiled consolingly. "You have wholeheartedly pursued
your <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> duties, and could not help neglecting your college

work. Apply yourself diligently to your books for the next week:
you shall get through your ordeal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> failure."

I returned to Calcutta, firmly suppressing all reasonable doubts
that occasionally arose with unnerving ridicule. Surveying the
mountain of books on my table, I felt like a traveler lost in a
wilderness. A <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> period of <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> me a labor-saving
inspiration. Opening each <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">book</span> at random, I studied only those
pages which lay <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> exposed. Pursuing this course during eighteen
hours a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> for a week, I considered myself entitled to advise all
succeeding generations on the <span class="t2 t6 t8 t9 t10 t15 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">art</span> of cramming.

The following <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">days</span> in the examination halls were a justification
of my seemingly haphazard procedure. I passed all the tests, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span>
by a hairbreadth. The congratulations of my friends and family were
ludicrously mixed with ejaculations betraying their astonishment.

On his return from Puri, Sri Yukteswar gave me a pleasant surprise.
"Your Calcutta studies are now over. I will see that you pursue
your last <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> of university <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> right here in Serampore."

I was puzzled. "Sir, there is no Bachelor of Arts course in this
town." Serampore College, the sole institution of <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> learning,
offered only a two-year course in Intermediate Arts.

Master smiled mischievously. "I am too old to go about collecting
donations to establish an A.B. college for you. I guess I shall
have to arrange the <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> through someone else."

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Two</span> months later Professor Howells, president of Serampore College,
publicly announced that he had succeeded in raising sufficient
funds to offer a four-year course. Serampore College became a branch
affiliation of the University of Calcutta. I was one of the first
students to enroll in Serampore as an A.B. candidate.

"Guruji, how kind you are to me! I have been longing to leave
Calcutta and be near you every <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> in Serampore. Professor Howells
does not dream how much he owes to your silent help!"

Sri Yukteswar gazed at me with mock severity. "Now you won't have
to spend so many hours on trains; what a lot of <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> for your
studies! Perhaps you will become less of a last-minute crammer and
more of a scholar." But somehow his tone lacked conviction.

{FN17-1} In 1936 I <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> from a friend that Sasi was still in
excellent health.

CHAPTER: 18

A MOHAMMEDAN WONDER-WORKER

"Years ago, right in this very room you now occupy, a Mohammedan
wonder-worker performed four miracles before me!"

Sri Yukteswar made this surprising statement during his first visit
to my new quarters. Immediately after entering Serampore College,
I had <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> a room in a near-by boardinghouse, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> PANTHI. It
was an old-fashioned brick mansion, fronting the Ganges.

"Master, what a coincidence! Are these newly decorated walls really
ancient with memories?" I looked around my simply furnished room
with awakened interest.

"It is a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> story." My guru smiled reminiscently. "The name of
the FAKIR {FN18-1} was Afzal Khan. He had acquired his extraordinary
powers through a chance encounter with a Hindu yogi.

"'Son, I am thirsty; fetch me some water.' A dust-covered SANNYASI
made this request of Afzal one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> during his early boyhood in a
small village of eastern Bengal.

"'Master, I am a Mohammedan. How could you, a Hindu, accept a drink
from my hands?'

"'Your truthfulness pleases me, my child. I do not observe
the ostracizing rules of ungodly sectarianism. Go; <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> me <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span>
quickly.'

"Afzal's reverent obedience was rewarded by a loving glance from
the yogi.

"'You possess <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> karma from former lives,' he observed solemnly.
'I am going to teach you a certain yoga method which will give you
command over one of the invisible realms. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> powers that
will be yours should be exercised for worthy ends; never employ
them selfishly! I perceive, alas! that you have <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> over from
the past some seeds of destructive tendencies. Do not allow them
to sprout by watering them with fresh <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> actions. The complexity
of your previous karma is such that you must <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> to
reconcile your yogic accomplishments with the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> humanitarian
goals.'

"After instructing the amazed boy in a complicated technique, the
<span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> vanished.

"Afzal faithfully followed his yoga exercise for twenty years. His
miraculous feats began to attract widespread attention. It seems that
he was always accompanied by a disembodied <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> whom he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span>

'Hazrat.' This invisible entity was able to fulfill the FAKIR'S
slightest wish.

"Ignoring his master's warning, Afzal began to misuse his powers.
Whatever <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> he touched and then replaced <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> soon disappear
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> a trace. This disconcerting eventuality usually made the
Mohammedan an objectionable guest!

"He visited large jewelry stores in Calcutta from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> to time,
representing himself as a possible purchaser. Any jewel he handled
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> vanish shortly after he had <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> the shop.

"Afzal was often surrounded by several hundred students, attracted
by the hope of learning his secrets. The FAKIR occasionally invited
them to travel with him. At the railway station he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> manage
to touch a roll of tickets. These he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> return to the clerk,
remarking: 'I have changed my mind, and won't buy them now.'
But when he boarded the train with his retinue, Afzal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be in
possession of the required tickets. {FN18-2}

"These exploits <span class="t16 hoverable">created</span> an indignant uproar; Bengali jewelers and
ticket-sellers were succumbing to nervous breakdowns! The police
who sought to arrest Afzal found themselves helpless; the FAKIR
could remove incriminating evidence merely by saying: 'Hazrat, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span>
this away.'"

Sri Yukteswar rose from his seat and walked to the balcony of my
room which overlooked the Ganges. I followed him, eager to hear
more of the baffling Mohammedan Raffles.

"This PANTHI <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> formerly belonged to a friend of mine. He became
acquainted with Afzal and asked him here. My friend also invited
about twenty neighbors, including myself. I was only a youth then,
and felt a lively curiosity about the notorious FAKIR." <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span>
laughed. "I <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> the precaution of not wearing anything valuable!
Afzal looked me over inquisitively, then remarked:

"'You have powerful hands. Go downstairs to the garden; get a
smooth stone and write your name on it with chalk; then throw the
stone as far as possible into the Ganges.'

"I obeyed. As soon as the stone had vanished under distant waves,
the Mohammedan addressed me again:

"'Fill a pot with Ganges <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> near the front of this house.'

"After I had returned with a vessel of water, the FAKIR cried,
'Hazrat, put the stone in the pot!'

"The stone appeared at once. I pulled it from the vessel and found

my signature as legible as when I had <span class="t0 t11 t24 hoverable">written</span> it.

"Babu, {FN18-3} one of my friends in the room, was wearing a heavy
antique gold watch and chain. The FAKIR examined them with ominous
admiration. Soon they were missing!

"'Afzal, please return my prized heirloom!' Babu was nearly in
tears.

"The Mohammedan was stoically silent for awhile, then said, 'You
have five hundred rupees in an iron safe. <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">Bring</span> them to me, and I
will tell you where to locate your timepiece.'

"The distraught Babu <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> immediately for his home. He came back
shortly and handed Afzal the required sum.

"'Go to the little bridge near your house,' the FAKIR instructed
Babu. 'Call on Hazrat to give you the watch and chain.'

"Babu rushed away. On his return, he was wearing a smile of relief
and no jewelry whatever.

"'When I commanded Hazrat as directed,' he announced, 'my watch
came tumbling down from the air into my right hand! You may be sure
I locked the heirloom in my safe before rejoining the group here!'

"Babu's friends, witnesses of the comicotragedy of the ransom for a
watch, were staring with resentment at Afzal. He now spoke placatingly.

"'Please name any drink you want; Hazrat will produce it.'

"A <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> asked for milk, others for fruit juices. I was not too
much shocked when the unnerved Babu requested whisky! The Mohammedan
gave an order; the obliging Hazrat sent sealed containers sailing
down the air and thudding to the floor. Each <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> found his desired
beverage.

"The promise of the fourth spectacular feat of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> was doubtless
gratifying to our host: Afzal offered to supply an instantaneous
lunch!

"'Let us <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> the most expensive dishes,' Babu suggested gloomily.
'I want an elaborate meal for my five hundred rupees! Everything
should be served on gold plates!'

"As soon as each <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> had expressed his preferences, the FAKIR addressed
himself to the inexhaustible Hazrat. A <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> rattle ensued; gold
platters filled with intricately-prepared curries, hot LUCHIS, and
many out-of-season fruits, landed from nowhere at our feet. All
the <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> was delicious. After feasting for an hour, we started to

leave the room. A tremendous noise, as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> dishes were being
piled up, caused us to turn around. Lo! there was no sign of the
glittering plates or the remnants of the meal."

"Guruji," I interrupted, "if Afzal could easily secure such <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span>
as gold dishes, why did he covet the property of others?"

"The FAKIR was not highly developed spiritually," Sri Yukteswar
explained. "His mastery of a certain yoga technique gave him access
to an astral plane where any <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> is immediately materialized.
Through the agency of an astral being, Hazrat, the Mohammedan could
summon the atoms of any <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> from etheric energy by an act of
powerful will. But such astrally-produced objects are structurally
evanescent; they cannot be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> retained. Afzal still yearned for
worldly wealth which, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> more hardly earned, has a more dependable
durability."

I laughed. "It too sometimes vanishes most unaccountably!"

"Afzal was not a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> of God-realization," <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> on. "Miracles
of a permanent and beneficial <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> are performed by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> saints
because they have attuned themselves to the omnipotent Creator.
Afzal was merely an ordinary <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> with an extraordinary <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of
penetrating a subtle realm not usually entered by mortals until
death."

"I understand now, Guruji. The after-world appears to have some
charming features."

<span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> agreed. "I never saw Afzal after that day, but a few <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span>
later Babu came to my home to show me a newspaper <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the
Mohammedan's public confession. From it I learned the facts I have
just told you about Afzal's early initiation from a Hindu guru."

The gist of the latter part of the published document, as recalled
by Sri Yukteswar, was as follows: "I, Afzal Khan, am writing these
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> as an act of penance and as a warning to those who seek the
possession of miraculous powers. For <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> I have been misusing the
wondrous abilities imparted to me through the grace of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> and my
master. I became drunk with egotism, feeling that I was beyond the
ordinary laws of morality. My <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> of reckoning finally arrived.

"Recently I met an old <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> on a road outside Calcutta. He limped
along painfully, carrying a shining <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> which looked like gold.
I addressed him with greed in my heart.

"'I am Afzal Khan, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> FAKIR. What have you there?'

"'This ball of gold is my sole material wealth; it can be of no
interest to a FAKIR. I implore you, sir, to heal my limp.'

"I touched the ball and walked away <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> reply. The old <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span>
hobbled after me. He soon raised an outcry: 'My gold is gone!'

"As I paid no attention, he suddenly spoke in a stentorian <span class="t23 hoverable">voice</span>
that issued oddly from his frail body:

"'Do you not recognize me?'

"I stood speechless, aghast at the belated discovery that this
unimpressive old cripple was none other than the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> saint who,
long, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> ago, had initiated me into yoga. He straightened himself;
his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> instantly became strong and youthful.

"'So!' My guru's glance was fiery. 'I see with my own <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> that
you <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> your powers, not to help suffering humanity, but to prey
on it like a common thief! I withdraw your occult gifts; Hazrat is
now freed from you. No longer shall you be a terror in Bengal!'

"I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> on Hazrat in anguished tones; for the first time, he did
not appear to my inner sight. But some dark veil suddenly lifted
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> me; I saw clearly the blasphemy of my life.

"'My guru, I thank you for coming to banish my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> delusion.' I
was sobbing at his feet. 'I promise to forsake my worldly ambitions.

I will retire to the mountains for lonely <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on God, hoping
to atone for my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> past.'

"My <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> regarded me with silent compassion. 'I feel your
sincerity,' he said finally. 'Because of your earlier <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> of
strict obedience, and because of your present repentance, I will
grant you one boon. Your other powers are now gone, but whenever
<span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> and clothing are needed, you may still <span class="t3 t11 t18 t27 hoverable">call</span> successfully on
Hazrat to supply them. Devote yourself wholeheartedly to <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span>
understanding in the mountain solitudes.'

"My guru then vanished; I was <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> to my tears and reflections.
Farewell, world! I go to seek the forgiveness of the Cosmic Beloved."

MY MASTER, IN CALCUTTA, APPEARS IN SERAMPORE

"I am often beset by atheistic doubts. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> a torturing surmise
sometimes haunts me: may not untapped <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> possibilities exist? Is
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> not missing his real destiny if he fails to explore them?"

These remarks of Dijen Babu, my roommate at the PANTHI boardinghouse,
were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> forth by my invitation that he meet my guru.

"Sri Yukteswarji will initiate you into KRIYA YOGA," I replied.
"It calms the dualistic turmoil by a <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> inner certainty."

That evening Dijen accompanied me to the hermitage. In Master's
presence my friend received such <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t13 hoverable">peace</span> that he was soon
a constant visitor. The trivial preoccupations of daily <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> are not
enough for man; <span class="t12 t20 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">wisdom</span> too is a native hunger. In Sri Yukteswar's
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> Dijen found an incentive to those attempts-first painful,
then effortlessly liberating-to locate a realer self <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> his
bosom than the humiliating ego of a temporary birth, seldom ample
enough for the Spirit.

As Dijen and I were both pursuing the A.B. course at Serampore
College, we got into the habit of walking <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> to the ashram

as soon as classes were over. We <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> often see Sri Yukteswar
standing on his second-floor balcony, welcoming our approach with
a smile.

One afternoon Kanai, a young hermitage resident, met Dijen and me
at the door with disappointing news.

"Master is not here; he was summoned to Calcutta by an urgent note."

The following <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> I received a post card from my guru. "I shall
leave Calcutta Wednesday morning," he had written. "You and Dijen
meet the nine o'clock train at Serampore station."

About eight-thirty on Wednesday morning, a telepathic message from
Sri Yukteswar flashed insistently to my mind: "I am delayed; don't
meet the nine o'clock train."

I conveyed the latest instructions to Dijen, who was already dressed
for departure.

"You and your intuition!" My friend's <span class="t23 hoverable">voice</span> was edged in scorn. "I
prefer to trust Master's <span class="t0 t11 t24 hoverable">written</span> word."

I shrugged my shoulders and seated myself with quiet finality.
Muttering angrily, Dijen made for the door and closed it noisily

behind him.

As the room was rather dark, I moved nearer to the window overlooking
the street. The scant sunlight suddenly increased to an intense
brilliancy in which the iron-barred window completely vanished.
Against this dazzling background appeared the clearly materialized
figure of Sri Yukteswar!

Bewildered to the point of shock, I rose from my chair and knelt
before him. With my customary gesture of respectful greeting at
my guru's feet, I touched his shoes. These were a pair familiar to
me, of orange-dyed canvas, soled with rope. His ocher swami cloth
brushed against me; I distinctly felt not only the texture of his
robe, but also the gritty surface of the shoes, and the pressure of
his toes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> them. Too much astounded to utter a word, I stood
up and gazed at him questioningly.

"I was pleased that you got my telepathic message." Master's <span class="t23 hoverable">voice</span>
was calm, entirely normal. "I have now finished my business in
Calcutta, and shall arrive in Serampore by the ten o'clock train."

As I still stared mutely, Sri Yukteswar <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> on, "This is not
an apparition, but my <span class="t21 hoverable">flesh</span> and blood form. I have been divinely
commanded to give you this experience, rare to achieve on earth.
Meet me at the station; you and Dijen will see me coming toward you,

dressed as I am now. I shall be preceded by a fellow passenger-a
little boy carrying a silver jug."

My guru placed both <span class="t13 t23 hoverable">hands</span> on my head, with a murmured blessing. As
he concluded with the words, "TABA ASI," {FN19-1} I <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> a peculiar
rumbling sound. {FN19-2} His <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> began to melt gradually <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span>
the piercing light. First his feet and legs vanished, then his
torso and head, like a scroll being rolled up. To the very last, I
could feel his fingers resting lightly on my hair. The effulgence
faded; nothing remained before me but the barred window and a pale
stream of sunlight.

I remained in a half-stupor of confusion, questioning <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> I had
not been the victim of a hallucination. A crestfallen Dijen soon
entered the room.

"Master was not on the nine o'clock train, nor even the nine-thirty."
My friend made his announcement with a slightly apologetic air.

"Come then; I know he will arrive at ten o'clock." I <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> Dijen's
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> and rushed him forcibly along with me, heedless of his protests.
In about ten minutes we entered the station, where the train was
already puffing to a halt.

"The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> train is filled with the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> of Master's aura! He is

there!" I exclaimed joyfully.

"You dream so?" Dijen laughed mockingly.

"Let us wait here." I told my friend details of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> in which our
guru <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> approach us. As I finished my description, Sri Yukteswar
came into view, wearing the same clothes I had seen a short <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span>
earlier. He walked slowly in the wake of a small lad bearing a
silver jug.

For a moment a wave of cold <span class="t28 hoverable">fear</span> passed through me, at the
unprecedented strangeness of my experience. I felt the materialistic,
twentieth-century <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> slipping from me; was I back in the ancient
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">days</span> when <span class="t0 t6 t8 t9 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t22 t23 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Jesus</span> appeared before Peter on the sea?

As Sri Yukteswar, a modern Yogi-Christ, reached the spot where
Dijen and I were speechlessly rooted, <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> smiled at my friend
and remarked:

"I sent you a message too, but you were unable to grasp it."

Dijen was silent, but glared at me suspiciously. After we
had escorted our guru to his hermitage, my friend and I proceeded
toward Serampore College. Dijen halted in the street, indignation
streaming from his every pore.

"So! <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> sent me a message! <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> you concealed it! I demand an
explanation!"

"Can I help it if your mental mirror oscillates with such restlessness
that you cannot register our guru's instructions?" I retorted.

The anger vanished from Dijen's face. "I see what you mean," he
said ruefully. "But please explain how you could know about the
child with the jug."

By the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> I had finished the story of Master's phenomenal
appearance at the boardinghouse that morning, my friend and I had
reached Serampore College.

"The <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> I have just <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> of our guru's powers," Dijen said,
"makes me feel that any university in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> is only a kindergarten."

WE DO NOT VISIT KASHMIR

"Father, I want to invite <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> and four friends to accompany me
to the Himalayan foothills during my summer vacation. May I have
six train passes to Kashmir and enough money to cover our travel
expenses?"

As I had expected, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Father</span> laughed heartily. "This is the <span class="t7 hoverable">third</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span>
you have given me the same cock-and-bull story. Didn't you make a
similar request last summer, and the year before that? At the last
moment, Sri Yukteswarji refuses to go."

"It is true, Father; I don't know why my guru will not give me his
definite <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> about Kashmir. {FN20-1} But if I tell him that I have
already secured the passes from you, somehow I think that this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span>
he will consent to make the journey."

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Father</span> was unconvinced at the moment, but the following day, after
some good-humored gibes, he handed me six passes and a roll of
ten-rupee bills.

"I hardly think your theoretical trip needs such practical props,"
he remarked, "but here they are."

That afternoon I exhibited my booty to Sri Yukteswar. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Though</span> he
smiled at my enthusiasm, his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> were noncommittal: "I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> like
to go; we shall see." He made no comment when I asked his little
hermitage disciple, Kanai, to accompany us. I also invited <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span>
other friends--Rajendra Nath Mitra, Jotin Auddy, and one other boy.
Our date of departure was <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> for the following Monday.

On Saturday and Sunday I stayed in Calcutta, where marriage rites
for a cousin were being celebrated at my family home. I arrived in
Serampore with my luggage early Monday morning. Rajendra met me at
the hermitage door.

"Master is out, walking. He has refused to go."

I was equally grieved and obdurate. "I will not give <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Father</span> a <span class="t7 hoverable">third</span>
chance to ridicule my chimerical plans for Kashmir. Come; the rest
of us will go anyhow."

Rajendra agreed; I <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> the ashram to <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> a servant. Kanai, I knew,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> the trip <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> Master, and someone was needed to
look after the luggage. I bethought myself of Behari, previously

a servant in my family home, who was now employed by a Serampore
schoolmaster. As I walked along briskly, I met my guru in front
of the Christian church near Serampore Courthouse.

"Where are you going?" Sri Yukteswar's face was unsmiling.

"Sir, I hear that you and Kanai will not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> the trip we have been
planning. I am seeking Behari. You will recall that last year he
was so anxious to see Kashmir that he even offered to serve <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span>
pay."

"I remember. Nevertheless, I don't think Behari will be willing to
go."

I was exasperated. "He is just eagerly waiting for this opportunity!"

My guru silently resumed his walk; I soon reached the schoolmaster's
house. Behari, in the courtyard, greeted me with a friendly warmth
that abruptly vanished as soon as I mentioned Kashmir. With a murmured
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> of apology, the servant <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> me and entered his employer's
house. I waited half an hour, nervously assuring myself that
Behari's delay was being caused by preparations for his trip.
Finally I knocked at the front door.

"Behari <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> by the back stairs about thirty minutes ago," a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span>

informed me. A slight smile hovered about his lips.

I departed sadly, wondering <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> my invitation had been too
coercive or <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> Master's unseen influence were at work. Passing
the Christian church, again I saw my guru walking slowly toward
me. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Without</span> waiting to hear my report, he exclaimed:

"So Behari <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> not go! Now, what are your plans?"

I felt like a recalcitrant child who is determined to defy his
masterful father. "Sir, I am going to ask my uncle to lend me his
servant, Lal Dhari."

"See your uncle if you want to," Sri Yukteswar replied with a
chuckle. "But I hardly think you will enjoy the visit."

Apprehensive but rebellious, I <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> my guru and entered Serampore
Courthouse. My paternal uncle, Sarada Ghosh, a government attorney,
welcomed me affectionately.

"I am leaving today with some friends for Kashmir," I told him.
"For <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> I have been looking forward to this Himalayan trip."

"I am happy for you, Mukunda. Is there anything I can do to make
your journey more comfortable?"

These kind <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> gave me a lift of encouragement. "Dear uncle," I
said, "could you possibly spare me your servant, Lal Dhari?"

My simple request had the effect of an earthquake. Uncle jumped so
violently that his chair overturned, the papers on the desk flew in
every direction, and his pipe, a long, coconut-stemmed hubble-bubble,
fell to the floor with a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> clatter.

"You selfish young man," he shouted, quivering with wrath, "what a
preposterous idea! Who will look after me, if you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> my servant
on one of your pleasure jaunts?"

I concealed my surprise, reflecting that my amiable uncle's sudden
change of front was only one more enigma in a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> fully devoted
to incomprehensibility. My retreat from the courthouse office was
more alacritous than dignified.

I returned to the hermitage, where my friends were expectantly
gathered. Conviction was growing on me that some sufficient if
exceedingly recondite motive was behind Master's attitude. Remorse
seized me that I had been trying to thwart my guru's will.

"Mukunda, wouldn't you like to stay awhile longer with me?" Sri
Yukteswar inquired. "Rajendra and the others can go ahead now, and

wait for you at Calcutta. There will be plenty of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> to catch
the last evening train leaving Calcutta for Kashmir."

"Sir, I don't care to go <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> you," I said mournfully.

My friends paid not the slightest attention to my remark. They
summoned a hackney carriage and departed with all the luggage.
Kanai and I sat quietly at our guru's feet. After a half hour of
complete silence, <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> rose and walked toward the second-floor
dining patio.

"Kanai, please serve Mukunda's food. His train leaves soon."

Getting up from my blanket seat, I staggered suddenly with nausea
and a ghastly churning sensation in my stomach. The stabbing pain
was so intense that I felt I had been abruptly hurled into some
violent hell. Groping blindly toward my guru, I collapsed before
him, attacked by all symptoms of the dread Asiatic cholera. Sri
Yukteswar and Kanai carried me to the sitting room.

Racked with agony, I cried, "Master, I surrender my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> to you;"
for I believed it was indeed fast ebbing from the shores of my
body.

Sri Yukteswar put my <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> on his lap, stroking my forehead with

angelic tenderness.

"You see now what <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have happened if you were at the station
with your friends," he said. "I had to look after you in this strange
way, because you chose to doubt my judgment about taking the trip
at this particular time."

I understood at last. Inasmuch as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> masters seldom see fit to
display their powers openly, a casual observer of the day's events
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have imagined that their sequence was quite natural. My guru's
intervention had been too subtle to be suspected. He had worked
his will through Behari and my Uncle Sarada and Rajendra and the
others in such an inconspicuous manner that probably everyone but
myself <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> the situations had been logically normal.

As Sri Yukteswar never failed to observe his social obligations,
he instructed Kanai to go for a specialist, and to notify my uncle.

"Master," I protested, "only you can heal me. I am too far gone
for any doctor."

"Child, you are protected by the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Mercy. Don't worry about
the doctor; he will not <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> you in this state. You are already
healed."

With my guru's words, the excruciating suffering <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> me. I sat up
feebly. A doctor soon arrived and examined me carefully.

"You appear to have passed through the worst," he said. "I will
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> some specimens with me for laboratory tests."

The following morning the physician arrived hurriedly. I was sitting
up, in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> spirits.

"Well, well, here you are, smiling and chatting as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> you had
had no close <span class="t3 t11 t18 t27 hoverable">call</span> with death." He patted my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> gently. "I hardly
expected to <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> you alive, after I had discovered from the specimens
that your disease was Asiatic cholera. You are fortunate, young
man, to have a guru with <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> healing powers! I am convinced of
it!"

I agreed wholeheartedly. As the doctor was preparing to leave,
Rajendra and Auddy appeared at the door. The resentment in their
faces changed into sympathy as they glanced at the physician and
then at my somewhat wan countenance.

"We were angry when you didn't turn up as agreed at the Calcutta
train. You have been sick?"

"Yes." I could not help laughing as my friends placed the luggage

in the same corner it had occupied yesterday. I quoted: "There was
a ship that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> to Spain; when it arrived, it came back again!"

<span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> entered the room. I permitted myself a convalescent's liberty,
and captured his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> lovingly.

"Guruji," I said, "from my twelfth year on, I have made many
unsuccessful attempts to reach the Himalayas. I am finally convinced
that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> your blessings the Goddess Parvati {FN20-2} will not
receive me!"

{FN20-1} Although <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> failed to make any explanation, his
reluctance to visit Kashmir during those <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> summers may have been
a foreknowledge that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> was not ripe for his illness there
(see <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">chapter</span> 22).

{FN20-2} Literally, "of the mountains." Parvati, mythologically
represented as a daughter of Himavat or the sacred mountains, is
a name given to the SHAKTI or "consort" of Shiva.

CHAPTER: 21

WE VISIT KASHMIR

"You are strong enough now to travel. I will accompany you to
Kashmir," Sri Yukteswar informed me <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">days</span> after my miraculous
recovery from Asiatic cholera.

That evening our party of six entrained for the north. Our first
leisurely stop was at Simla, a queenly <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">city</span> resting on the throne
of Himalayan hills. We strolled over the steep streets, admiring
the magnificent views.

"English strawberries for sale," cried an old woman, squatting in
a picturesque open market place.

<span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> was curious about the strange little red fruits. He bought
a basketful and offered it to Kanai and myself, who were near-by.
I tasted one berry but spat it hastily on the ground.

"Sir, what a sour fruit! I could never like strawberries!"

My guru laughed. "Oh, you will like them-in America. At a dinner
there, your hostess will serve them with sugar and cream. After she
has mashed the berries with a fork, you will taste them and say:
'What delicious strawberries!' Then you will remember this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> in
Simla."

Sri Yukteswar's forecast vanished from my mind, but reappeared
there many <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> later, shortly after my arrival in America. I was
a dinner guest at the home of Mrs. Alice T. Hasey (Sister Yogmata)
in West Somerville, Massachusetts. When a dessert of strawberries
was put on the table, my hostess picked up her fork and mashed my
berries, adding cream and sugar. "The fruit is rather tart; I think
you will like it fixed this way," she remarked.

I <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> a mouthful. "What delicious strawberries!" I exclaimed.
At once my guru's prediction in Simla emerged from the fathomless
cave of memory. It was staggering to realize that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> ago Sri
Yukteswar's God-tuned <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> had sensitively detected the program of
karmic events wandering in the ether of futurity.

Our party soon <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> Simla and entrained for Rawalpindi. There
we hired a large landau, drawn by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> horses, in which we started
a seven-day trip to Srinagar, capital <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">city</span> of Kashmir. The <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span>
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> of our northbound journey <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> into <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> Himalayan
vastness. As the iron wheels of our carriage creaked along the hot,
stony roads, we were enraptured with changing vistas of mountainous
grandeur.

"Sir," Auddy said to Master, "I am greatly enjoying these glorious
scenes in your <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">holy</span> company."

I felt a throb of pleasure at Auddy's appreciation, for I was acting
as host on this trip. Sri Yukteswar caught my thought; he turned
to me and whispered:

"Don't flatter yourself; Auddy is not nearly as entranced with the
scenery as he is with the prospect of leaving us <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> enough to
have a cigaret."

I was shocked. "Sir," I said in an undertone, "please do not break
our harmony by these unpleasant words. I can hardly believe that
Auddy is hankering for a smoke." {FN21-1} I looked apprehensively
at my usually irrepressible guru.

"Very well; I won't say anything to Auddy." <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> chuckled. "But
you will soon see, when the landau halts, that Auddy is quick to
seize his opportunity."

The carriage arrived at a small caravanserai. As our horses were led
to be watered, Auddy inquired, "Sir, do you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> if I ride awhile
with the driver? I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> like to get a little outside air."

Sri Yukteswar gave permission, but remarked to me, "He wants fresh
smoke and not fresh air."

The landau resumed its noisy progress over the dusty roads. Master's

eyes were twinkling; he instructed me, "Crane up your neck through
the carriage door and see what Auddy is doing with the air."

I obeyed, and was astounded to observe Auddy in the act of exhaling
rings of cigaret smoke. My glance toward Sri Yukteswar was apologetic.

"You are right, as always, sir. Auddy is enjoying a puff along with
a panorama." I surmised that my friend had received a gift from the
cab driver; I knew Auddy had not carried any cigarets from Calcutta.

We continued on the labyrinthine way, adorned by views of rivers,
valleys, precipitous crags, and multitudinous mountain tiers.
Every night we stopped at rustic inns, and prepared our own food.
Sri Yukteswar <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> special care of my diet, insisting that I have
lime juice at all meals. I was still weak, but daily improving,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> the rattling carriage was strictly designed for discomfort.

Joyous anticipations filled our hearts as we neared central Kashmir,
paradise <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">land</span> of lotus lakes, floating gardens, gaily canopied
houseboats, the many-bridged Jhelum River, and flower-strewn
pastures, all ringed round by the Himalayan majesty. Our approach
to Srinagar was through an avenue of tall, welcoming trees. We
engaged rooms at a double-storied inn overlooking the noble hills.
No running <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> was available; we drew our supply from a near-by
well. The summer weather was ideal, with warm <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">days</span> and slightly

cold nights.

We made a pilgrimage to the ancient Srinagar temple of Swami
Shankara. As I gazed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the mountain-peak hermitage, standing
bold against the sky, I fell into an ecstatic trance. A vision
appeared of a hilltop mansion in a distant land. The lofty Shankara
ashram before me was transformed into the structure where, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span>
later, I established the Self-Realization Fellowship headquarters
in America. When I first visited Los Angeles, and saw the large
building on the crest of Mount Washington, I recognized it at once
from my long-past visions in Kashmir and elsewhere.

A few <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">days</span> at Srinagar; then on to Gulmarg ("mountain paths of
flowers"), elevated by six <span class="t15 t23 hoverable">thousand</span> feet. There I had my first ride
on a large horse. Rajendra mounted a small trotter, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span>
was fired with ambition for speed. We ventured onto the very steep
Khilanmarg; the path led through a dense forest, abounding in
tree-mushrooms, where the mist-shrouded trails were often precarious.
But Rajendra's little animal never permitted my oversized steed a
moment's rest, even at the most perilous turns. On, on, untiringly
came Rajendra's horse, oblivious to all but the joy of competition.

Our strenuous race was rewarded by a breath-taking view. For
the first <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> in this life, I gazed in all directions at sublime
snow-capped Himalayas, lying tier <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> tier like silhouettes of

huge polar bears. My <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> feasted exultingly on endless reaches
of icy mountains against sunny blue skies.

I rolled merrily with my young companions, all wearing overcoats,
on the sparkling white slopes. On our downward trip we saw afar a
vast carpet of yellow flowers, wholly transfiguring the bleak hills.

Our next excursions were to the famous royal "pleasure gardens"
of the Emperor Jehangir, at Shalimar and Nishat Bagh. The ancient
palace at Nishat Bagh is built directly over a natural waterfall.
Rushing down from the mountains, the torrent has been regulated
through ingenious contrivances to flow over colorful terraces and
to gush into fountains amidst the dazzling flower-beds. The stream
also enters several of the palace rooms, ultimately dropping fairy
like into the lake below. The immense gardens are riotous with
color--roses of a dozen hues, snapdragons, lavender, pansies,
poppies. An emerald enclosing outline is given by symmetrical rows
of CHINARS, {FN21-2} cypresses, cherry trees; beyond them tower
the white austerities of the Himalayas.

Kashmir grapes are considered a rare delicacy in Calcutta. Rajendra,
who had been promising himself a veritable feast on reaching Kashmir,
was disappointed to <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> there no large vineyards. Now and then I
chaffed him jocosely over his baseless anticipation.

"Oh, I have become so much gorged with grapes I can't walk!" I
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> say. "The invisible grapes are brewing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> me!" Later I
<span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> that sweet grapes grow abundantly in Kabul, west of Kashmir.
We consoled ourselves with ice cream made of RABRI, a heavily
condensed milk, and flavored with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> pistachio nuts.

We <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> several trips in the SHIKARAS or houseboats, shaded by
red-embroidered canopies, coursing along the intricate channels of
Dal Lake, a network of canals like a watery spider web. Here the
numerous floating gardens, crudely improvised with logs and earth,
strike one with amazement, so incongruous is the first sight of
vegetables and melons growing in the midst of vast waters. Occasionally
one sees a peasant, disdaining to be "rooted to the soil," towing
his square plot of "land" to a new location in the many-fingered
lake.

In this storied vale one finds an epitome of all the earth's
beauties. The Lady of Kashmir is mountain-crowned, lake-garlanded,
and flower-shod. In later years, after I had toured many distant
lands, I understood why Kashmir is often <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the world's most
scenic spot. It possesses some of the charms of the Swiss Alps,
and of Loch Lomond in Scotland, and of the exquisite English lakes.
An American traveler in Kashmir finds much to remind him of the
rugged grandeur of Alaska and of Pikes Peak near Denver.

As entries in a scenic beauty contest, I offer for first prize
either the gorgeous <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of Xochimilco in Mexico, where mountains,
skies, and poplars reflect themselves in myriad lanes of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> amidst
the playful fish, or the jewel-like lakes of Kashmir, guarded like
beautiful maidens by the stern surveillance of the Himalayas. These
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> places stand out in my memory as the loveliest spots on earth.

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> I was awed also when I first beheld the wonders of Yellowstone
National Park and of the Grand Canyon of the Colorado, and of
Alaska. Yellowstone Park is perhaps the only region where one can
see innumerable geysers shooting <span class="t23 hoverable">high</span> into the air, performing year
after year with clockwork regularity. Its opal and sapphire pools
and hot sulphurous springs, its bears and wild creatures, remind
one that here <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Nature</span> <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> a specimen of her earliest creation.
Motoring along the roads of Wyoming to the "Devil's Paint Pot" of
hot bubbling mud, with gurgling springs, vaporous fountains, and
spouting geysers in all directions, I was disposed to say that
Yellowstone deserves a special prize for uniqueness.

The ancient majestic redwoods of Yosemite, stretching their huge
columns far into the unfathomable sky, are green natural cathedrals
designed with skill divine. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Though</span> there are wonderful falls in
the Orient, none match the torrential beauty of Niagara near the
Canadian border. The Mammoth Caves of Kentucky and the Carlsbad
Caverns in New Mexico, with colorful iciclelike formations, are

stunning fairylands. Their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> needles of stalactite spires,
hanging from cave ceilings and mirrored in underground waters,
present a glimpse of other worlds as fancied by man.

Most of the Hindus of Kashmir, world-famed for their beauty, are
as white as Europeans and have similar features and bone structure;
many have blue <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> and blonde hair. Dressed in Western clothes,
they look like Americans. The cold Himalayas protect the Kashmiris
from the sultry <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> and preserve their <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> complexions. As one
travels to the southern and tropical latitudes of India, he finds
progressively that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> become darker and darker.

After spending happy weeks in Kashmir, I was forced to return to
Bengal for the fall term of Serampore College. Sri Yukteswar remained
in Srinagar, with Kanai and Auddy. Before I departed, <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> hinted
that his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be subject to suffering in Kashmir.

"Sir, you look a picture of health," I protested.

"There is a chance that I may even leave this earth."

"Guruji!" I fell at his feet with an imploring gesture. "Please
promise that you won't leave your <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> now. I am utterly unprepared
to carry on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> you."

Sri Yukteswar was silent, but smiled at me so compassionately that
I felt reassured. Reluctantly I <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> him.

"Master dangerously ill." This telegram from Auddy reached me
shortly after my return to Serampore.

"Sir," I wired my guru frantically, "I asked for your promise not
to leave me. Please keep your body; otherwise, I also shall die."

"Be it as you wish." This was Sri Yukteswar's reply from Kashmir.

A letter from Auddy arrived in a few days, informing me that
<span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> had recovered. On his return to Serampore during the next
fortnight, I was grieved to <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> my guru's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> reduced to half
its usual weight.

Fortunately for his disciples, Sri Yukteswar burned many of their
sins in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> of his severe fever in Kashmir. The metaphysical
method of <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> transfer of disease is known to highly advanced
yogis. A strong <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> can assist a weaker one by helping to carry his
heavy load; a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> superman is able to minimize his disciples'
<span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> or mental burdens by sharing the karma of their past actions.
Just as a rich <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> loses some money when he pays off a large debt
for his prodigal son, who is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> saved from dire consequences of

his own folly, so a <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> willingly sacrifices a portion of his
bodily wealth to lighten the misery of disciples. {FN21-3}

By a secret method, the yogi unites his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> and astral vehicle
with those of a suffering individual; the disease is conveyed,
wholly or in part, to the saint's body. Having harvested <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> on
the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> field, a <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> no longer cares what happens to that
material form. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Though</span> he may allow it to register a certain disease
in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> to relieve others, his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> is never affected; he considers
himself fortunate in being able to render such aid.

The devotee who has achieved final salvation in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> finds that

Escaping to the superconsciousness whenever he so desires, a <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span>
can remain oblivious of <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> suffering; sometimes he chooses to
bear bodily pain stoically, as an example to disciples. By putting
on the ailments of others, a yogi can satisfy, for them, the karmic
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">law</span> of cause and effect.

however, a <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> who wishes to greatly quicken his disciples'
evolution may then voluntarily <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> out on his own <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> a large

In this manner they were highly purified and made fit to receive
the omnipresent <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> which later descended on them.

Only a self-realized <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> can transfer his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> force, or convey

employ this yogic method of cure, nor is it desirable that he
should do so; for an unsound <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> instrument is a hindrance to
God--meditation. The Hindu scriptures teach that the first duty of

unable to remain fixed in devotional concentration.

A very strong mind, however, can transcend all <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> difficulties
and attain to God-realization. Many saints have ignored illness and

succeeded in their <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> quest. St. Francis of Assisi, severely
afflicted with ailments, healed others and even raised the dead.

I knew an Indian saint, half of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> was once festering with
sores. His diabetic condition was so acute that under ordinary
conditions he could not sit still at one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> for more than fifteen
minutes. But his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> aspiration was undeterrable. "Lord,"
he prayed, "wilt <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thou</span> come into my broken temple?" With ceaseless
command of will, the saint gradually became able to sit daily in
the lotus posture for eighteen continuous hours, engrossed in the
ecstatic trance.

"And," he told me, "at the end of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> years, I found the Infinite

Rejoicing in the joyful
splendour, I forgot the body. Later I saw that it had become <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span>

A historical healing incident concerns <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span> Baber (1483-1530),
founder of the Mogul empire in India. His son, Prince Humayun, was
mortally ill. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">father</span> prayed with anguished determination that
he receive the sickness, and that his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> be spared. After all
physicians had given up hope, Humayun recovered. Baber immediately
fell sick and died of the same disease which had stricken his son.
Humayun succeeded Baber as Emperor of Hindustan.

Many <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> imagine that every <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> has, or should have,
the health and strength of a Sandow. The assumption is unfounded.
A sickly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> does not indicate that a guru is not in touch with

inner illumination. The condition of the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> body, in other
words, cannot rightfully be made a test of a master. His distinguishing
qualifications must be sought in his own domain, the spiritual.

Numerous bewildered seekers in the West erroneously think that an
eloquent speaker or writer on metaphysics must be a master. The
rishis, however, have pointed out that the acid test of a <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span>
is a man's ability to enter at will the breathless state, and to
maintain the unbroken SAMADHI of NIRBIKALPA. {FN21-5} Only by these
achievements can a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> being prove that he has "mastered" MAYA

of realization: "EKAM SAT,"-"Only One exists."

strange way. Few saints were ever more sensitively equipped with

When I ventured a few <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> of sympathy over his emaciated figure,
my guru said gaily:

"As a loyal Hindu wife, I do not wish to complain of my husband. But
I yearn to see him turn from his materialistic views. He delights
in ridiculing the pictures of saints in my <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> room. Dear
brother, I have deep <span class="t4 t7 t12 t16 hoverable">faith</span> that you can help him. Will you?"

My eldest sister Roma gazed beseechingly at me. I was paying
a short visit at her Calcutta home on Girish Vidyaratna Lane. Her
plea touched me, for she had exercised a profound <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> influence
over my early life, and had lovingly tried to fill the void <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span>

in the family circle by Mother's death.

"Beloved sister, of course I will do anything I can." I smiled,
eager to lift the gloom plainly visible on her face, in contrast
to her usual calm and cheerful expression.

Roma and I sat awhile in silent prayer for guidance. A year earlier,
my sister had asked me to initiate her into KRIYA YOGA, in which
she was making notable progress.

An inspiration seized me. "Tomorrow," I said, "I am going to the
Dakshineswar temple. Please come with me, and persuade your husband
to accompany us. I feel that in the vibrations of that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">holy</span> place,

in wanting him to go."

Sister agreed hopefully. Very early the next morning I was pleased
to <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> that Roma and her husband were in readiness for the trip.
As our hackney carriage rattled along Upper Circular Road toward
Dakshineswar, my brother-in-law, Satish Chandra Bose, amused himself
by deriding <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> gurus of the past, present, and future. I
noticed that Roma was quietly weeping.

[Illustration: My sister Uma, as a young girl--see uma.jpg]

"Sister, cheer up!" I whispered. "Don't give your husband the
satisfaction of believing that we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> his mockery seriously."

"Mukunda, how can you admire worthless humbugs?" Satish was saying.
"A SADHU'S very appearance is repulsive. He is either as thin as
a skeleton, or as unholily fat as an elephant!"

I shouted with laughter. My good-natured reaction was annoying
to Satish; he retired into sullen silence. As our cab entered the
Dakshineswar grounds, he grinned sarcastically.

"This excursion, I suppose, is a scheme to reform me?"

As I turned away <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> reply, he caught my arm. "Young Mr. Monk,"
he said, "don't forget to make proper arrangements with the temple
authorities to provide for our noon meal."

"I am going to meditate now. Do not worry about your lunch," I
replied sharply. "Divine Mother will look after it."

"I don't trust <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Mother to do a single <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> for me. But I do
hold you responsible for my food." Satish's tones were threatening.

I proceeded alone to the colonnaded hall which fronts the large
temple of Kali, or Mother Nature. Selecting a shady spot near one
of the pillars, I arranged my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> in the lotus posture. Although
it was only about seven o'clock, the morning <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> soon be

The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> receded as I became devotionally entranced. My <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> was
concentrated on Goddess Kali, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> image at Dakshineswar had been
the special <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of adoration by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> master, Sri Ramakrishna
Paramhansa. In answer to his anguished demands, the stone image of
this very temple had often <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> a living <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> and conversed with
him.

"Silent Mother with stony heart," I prayed, "Thou becamest filled
with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> at the request of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thy</span> beloved devotee Ramakrishna; why

My aspiring zeal increased boundlessly, accompanied by a <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span>
peace. Yet, when five hours had passed, and the Goddess whom
I was inwardly visualizing had made no response, I felt slightly
disheartened. Sometimes it is a test by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> to delay the fulfillment

of prayers. But He eventually appears to the persistent devotee
in whatever <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> he holds dear. A devout Christian sees Jesus; a
Hindu beholds Krishna, or the Goddess Kali, or an expanding <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Light</span>
if his worship takes an impersonal turn.

Reluctantly I opened my eyes, and saw that the temple doors were
being locked by a priest, in conformance with a noon-hour custom.
I rose from my secluded seat under the open, roofed hall, and stepped
into the courtyard. Its stone floor was scorching under the midday
sun; my bare feet were painfully burned.

"Divine Mother," I silently remonstrated, "Thou didst not come to
me in vision, and now <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thou</span> <span class="t2 t6 t8 t9 t10 t15 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">art</span> hidden in the temple behind closed
doors. I wanted to offer a special prayer to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thee</span> today on behalf
of my brother-in-law."

My inward petition was instantly acknowledged. First, a delightful
cold wave descended over my back and under my feet, banishing
all discomfort. Then, to my amazement, the temple became greatly
magnified. Its large door slowly opened, revealing the stone figure
of Goddess Kali. Gradually it changed into a living form, smilingly
nodding in greeting, thrilling me with joy indescribable. As if by
a mystic syringe, the breath was withdrawn from my lungs; my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span>
became very still, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> not inert.

An ecstatic enlargement of <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> followed. I could see
clearly for several miles over the Ganges River to my left, and
beyond the temple into the entire Dakshineswar precincts. The walls
of all buildings glimmered transparently; through them I observed
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> walking to and fro over distant acres.

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Though</span> I was breathless and my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> in a strangely quiet state, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span>
I was able to move my <span class="t13 t23 hoverable">hands</span> and feet freely. For several minutes
I experimented in closing and opening my eyes; in either <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> I
saw distinctly the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> Dakshineswar panorama.

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">Spiritual</span> sight, x-raylike, penetrates into all matter; the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span>
eye is center everywhere, circumference nowhere. I realized anew,
standing there in the sunny courtyard, that when <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> ceases to be a
prodigal child of God, engrossed in a <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> indeed dream,
baseless as a bubble, he reinherits his <span class="t20 hoverable">eternal</span> realms. If "escapism"
be a need of man, cramped in his narrow personality, can any escape
compare with the majesty of omnipresence?

In my sacred experience at Dakshineswar, the only extraordinarily-enlarged
objects were the temple and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of the Goddess. Everything
else appeared in its normal dimensions, although each was enclosed
in a halo of mellow light-white, blue, and pastel rainbow hues. My
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> seemed to be of ethereal substance, ready to levitate. Fully
conscious of my material surroundings, I was looking about me and

taking a few steps <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> disturbing the continuity of the blissful
vision.

Behind the temple walls I suddenly glimpsed my brother-in-law
as he sat under the thorny branches of a sacred BEL tree. I could
effortlessly discern the course of his thoughts. Somewhat uplifted
under the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">holy</span> influence of Dakshineswar, his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> held unkind
reflections about me. I turned directly to the gracious <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of
the Goddess.

"Divine Mother," I prayed, "wilt <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thou</span> not spiritually change my
sister's husband?"

The beautiful figure, hitherto silent, spoke at last: "Thy wish is
granted!"

I looked happily at Satish. As <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> instinctively aware that some

the ground. I saw him running behind the temple; he approached me,
shaking his fist.

The all-embracing vision disappeared. No longer could I see the
glorious Goddess; the towering temple was reduced to its ordinary
size, minus its transparency. Again my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> sweltered under the

fierce rays of the sun. I jumped to the shelter of the pillared
hall, where Satish pursued me angrily. I looked at my watch. It
was one o'clock; the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> vision had lasted an hour.

"You little fool," my brother-in-law blurted out, "you have been
sitting there cross-legged and cross-eyed for six hours. I have
gone back and forth watching you. Where is my food? Now the temple
is closed; you failed to notify the authorities; we are <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span>
lunch!"

The exaltation I had felt at the Goddess' presence was still vibrant
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> my heart. I was emboldened to exclaim, "Divine Mother will
feed us!"

Satish was beside himself with rage. "Once and for all," he shouted,
"I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> like to see your <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Mother giving us <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> here <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span>
prior arrangements!"

His <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> were hardly uttered when a temple priest crossed the
courtyard and joined us.

"Son," he addressed me, "I have been observing your face serenely
glowing during hours of meditation. I saw the arrival of your party
this morning, and felt a <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> to put aside ample <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> for your
lunch. It is against the temple rules to feed those who do not make

a request beforehand, but I have made an exception for you."

I thanked him, and gazed straight into Satish's eyes. He flushed
with emotion, lowering his gaze in silent repentance. When we were
served a lavish meal, including out-of-season mangoes, I noticed
that my brother-in-law's appetite was meager. He was bewildered,
diving deep into the ocean of thought. On the return journey to
Calcutta, Satish, with softened expression, occasionally glanced at
me pleadingly. But he did not <span class="t9 t11 t20 t21 t22 t23 t27 hoverable">speak</span> a single <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> after the moment
the priest had appeared to invite us to lunch, as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> in direct
answer to Satish's challenge.

The following afternoon I visited my sister at her home. She greeted
me affectionately.

"Dear brother," she cried, "what a miracle! Last evening my husband
wept openly before me.

"'Beloved DEVI,' {FN22-1} he said, 'I am happy beyond expression
that this reforming scheme of your brother's has wrought a
transformation. I am going to undo every wrong I have done you. From

to perceive that he had developed highly in self-realization, and
had been <span class="t11 hoverable">blessed</span> by the vision of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Mother. During my stay

"Dear brother," she said, "I am well, and my husband is sick.
Nevertheless, I want you to know that, as a devoted Hindu wife, I
am going to be the first one to die. {FN22-2} It won't be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> now

her prediction. My youngest brother Bishnu later gave me the details.

"Roma and Satish were in Calcutta at the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of her death," Bishnu
told me. "That morning she dressed herself in her bridal finery.

"'This is my last <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> of service to you on earth,' Roma replied.
A short <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> later she had a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> attack. As her <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> was rushing
out for aid, she said:

"'Son, do not leave me. It is no use; I shall be gone before a
doctor could arrive.' Ten minutes later, holding the feet of her
husband in reverence, Roma consciously <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> her body, happily and
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> suffering.

"Satish became very reclusive after his wife's death," Bishnu
continued. "One <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> he and I were looking at a large smiling
photograph of Roma.

"'Why do you smile?' Satish suddenly exclaimed, as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> his wife

"Although at this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> Satish had fully recovered from his sickness,

CHAPTER: 23

I RECEIVE MY UNIVERSITY DEGREE

"You ignore your textbook assignments in philosophy. No doubt you
are depending on an unlaborious 'intuition' to get you through the
examinations. But unless you apply yourself in a more scholarly
manner, I shall see to it that you don't <span class="t6 t9 t13 t15 t17 t18 t23 t28 t29 hoverable">pass</span> this course."

Professor D. C. Ghoshal of Serampore College was addressing me
sternly. If I failed to <span class="t6 t9 t13 t15 t17 t18 t23 t28 t29 hoverable">pass</span> his final <span class="t0 t11 t24 hoverable">written</span> classroom test, I
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be ineligible to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> the conclusive examinations. These are
formulated by the faculty of Calcutta University, which numbers

Serampore College among its affiliated branches. A student in Indian
universities who is unsuccessful in one subject in the A.B. finals
must be examined anew in ALL his subjects the following year.

My instructors at Serampore College usually treated me with kindness,
not untinged by an amused tolerance. "Mukunda is a bit over-drunk
with religion." <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> summing me up, they tactfully spared me the
embarrassment of answering classroom questions; they trusted the
final <span class="t0 t11 t24 hoverable">written</span> tests to eliminate me from the list of A.B. candidates.
The judgment passed by my fellow students was expressed in their
nickname for me-"Mad Monk."

I <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> an ingenious step to nullify Professor Ghoshal's threat to
me of failure in philosophy. When the results of the final tests
were about to be publicly announced, I asked a classmate to accompany
me to the professor's study.

"Come along; I want a witness," I told my companion. "I shall be
very much disappointed if I have not succeeded in outwitting the
instructor."

Professor Ghoshal shook his <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> after I had inquired what rating
he had given my paper.

"You are not among those who have passed," he said in triumph. He

hunted through a large pile on his desk. "Your paper isn't here at
all; you have failed, in any case, through non-appearance at the
examination."

I chuckled. "Sir, I was there. May I look through the stack myself?"

The professor, nonplused, gave his permission; I quickly found my
paper, where I had carefully omitted any identification mark except
my roll <span class="t3 t11 t18 t27 hoverable">call</span> number. Unwarned by the "red flag" of my name, the
instructor had given a <span class="t23 hoverable">high</span> rating to my answers even <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> they
were unembellished by textbook quotations. {FN23-1}

Seeing through my trick, he now thundered, "Sheer brazen luck!" He
added hopefully, "You are sure to fail in the A.B. finals."

For the tests in my other subjects, I received some coaching,
particularly from my dear friend and cousin, Prabhas Chandra
Ghose, {FN23-2} <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> of my Uncle Sarada. I staggered painfully but
successfully-with the lowest possible passing marks-through all my
final tests.

Now, after four <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> of college, I was eligible to sit for the
A.B. examinations. Nevertheless, I hardly expected to avail myself
of the privilege. The Serampore College finals were child's play
compared to the stiff ones which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> by Calcutta University

for the A.B. degree. My almost daily visits to Sri Yukteswar had
<span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> me little <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> to enter the college halls. There it was my
presence rather than my absence that <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> forth ejaculations of
amazement from my classmates!

My customary routine was to <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> out on my bicycle about nine-thirty
in the morning. In one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> carry an <span class="t22 t23 t28 hoverable">offering</span> for my guru-a
few flowers from the garden of my PANTHI boardinghouse. Greeting
me affably, <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> invite me to lunch. I invariably accepted
with alacrity, glad to banish the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> of college for the day.
After hours with Sri Yukteswar, listening to his incomparable flow of
wisdom, or helping with ashram duties, I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> reluctantly depart
around midnight for the PANTHI. Occasionally I stayed all night with
my guru, so happily engrossed in his conversation that I scarcely
noticed when darkness changed into dawn.

One night about eleven o'clock, as I was putting on my shoes
{FN23-3} in preparation for the ride to the boardinghouse, <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span>
questioned me gravely.

"When do your A.B. examinations start?"

"Five <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">days</span> hence, sir."

"I hope you are in readiness for them."

Transfixed with alarm, I held one shoe in the air. "Sir," I
protested, "you know how my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">days</span> have been passed with you rather
than with the professors. How can I enact a farce by appearing for
those difficult finals?"

Sri Yukteswar's <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> were turned piercingly on mine. "You must
appear." His tone was coldly peremptory. "We should not give cause
for your <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">father</span> and other relatives to criticize your preference
for ashram life. Just promise me that you will be present for the
examinations; answer them the best <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> you can."

Uncontrollable tears were coursing down my face. I felt that
Master's command was unreasonable, and that his interest was, to
say the least, belated.

"I will appear if you wish it," I said amidst sobs. "But no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span>
remains for proper preparation." Under my breath I muttered, "I will
fill up the sheets with your teachings in answer to the questions!"

When I entered the hermitage the following <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> at my usual hour,
I presented my bouquet with a certain mournful solemnity. Sri
Yukteswar laughed at my woebegone air.

"Mukunda, has the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> ever failed you, at an examination or

elsewhere?"

"No, sir," I responded warmly. Grateful memories came in a revivifying
flood.

"Not laziness but burning zeal for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> has prevented you from
seeking college honors," my guru said kindly. After a silence, he
quoted, "'Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and His righteousness;
and all these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> shall be added <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">unto</span> you.'" {FN23-4}

For the thousandth time, I felt my burdens lifted in Master's
presence. When we had finished our early lunch, he suggested that
I return to the PANTHI.

"Does your friend, Romesh Chandra Dutt, still live in your
boardinghouse?"

"Yes, sir."

"Get in touch with him; the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> will inspire him to help you with
the examinations."

"Very well, sir; but Romesh is unusually busy. He is the honor <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span>
in our class, and carries a heavier course than the others."

Master waved aside my objections. "Romesh will <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> for you.
Now go."

I bicycled back to the PANTHI. The first <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> I met in the
boardinghouse compound was the scholarly Romesh. As <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">days</span>
were quite free, he obligingly agreed to my diffident request.

"Of course; I am at your service." He spent several hours of that
afternoon and of succeeding <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">days</span> in coaching me in my various
subjects.

"I believe many questions in English literature will be centered
in the route of Childe Harold," he told me. "We must get an atlas
at once."

I hastened to the home of my Uncle Sarada and borrowed an atlas.
Romesh marked the European map at the places visited by Byron's
romantic traveler.

A few classmates had gathered around to listen to the tutoring.
"Romesh is advising you wrongly," one of them commented to me at
the end of a session. "Usually only fifty per cent of the questions
are about the books; the other half will involve the authors'
lives."

When I sat for the examination in English literature the following
day, my first glance at the questions caused tears of gratitude
to pour forth, wetting my paper. The classroom monitor came to my
desk and made a sympathetic inquiry.

"My guru foretold that Romesh <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> help me," I explained. "Look;
the very questions dictated to me by Romesh are here on the examination
sheet! Fortunately for me, there are very few questions this year
on English authors, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> lives are wrapped in deep mystery so far
as I am concerned!"

My boardinghouse was in an uproar when I returned. The boys who
had been ridiculing Romesh's method of coaching looked at me in
awe, almost deafening me with congratulations. During the week of
the examinations, I spent many hours with Romesh, who formulated
questions that he <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> were likely to be <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> by the professors.
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Day</span> by day, Romesh's questions appeared in almost the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> on
the examination sheets.

The news was widely circulated in the college that something resembling
a miracle was occurring, and that success seemed probable for the
absent-minded "Mad Monk." I made no attempt to hide the facts of the
case. The local professors were powerless to alter the questions,
which had been arranged by Calcutta University.

Thinking over the examination in English literature, I realized
one morning that I had made a serious error. One section of the
questions had been divided into <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> parts of A or B, and C or D.
Instead of answering one question from each part, I had carelessly
answered both questions in Group I, and had failed to consider
anything in Group II. The best mark I could score in that paper
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be 33, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> less than the passing mark of 36. I rushed to
<span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> and poured out my troubles.

"Sir, I have made an unpardonable blunder. I don't deserve the
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> blessings through Romesh; I am quite unworthy."

"Cheer up, Mukunda." Sri Yukteswar's tones were <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> and unconcerned.
He pointed to the blue vault of the heavens. "It is more possible
for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> and moon to interchange their positions in space than
it is for you to fail in getting your degree!"

I <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> the hermitage in a more tranquil mood, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> it seemed
mathematically inconceivable that I could pass. I looked once or
twice apprehensively into the sky; the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Day</span> appeared to be
securely anchored in his customary orbit!

As I reached the PANTHI, I overheard a classmate's remark: "I
have just learned that this year, for the first time, the required
passing mark in English literature has been lowered."

I entered the boy's room with such speed that he looked up in alarm.
I questioned him eagerly.

"Long-haired monk," he said laughingly, "why this sudden interest
in scholastic matters? Why cry in the eleventh hour? But it is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span>
that the passing mark has just been lowered to 33 points."

A few joyous leaps <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> me into my own room, where I sank to my
knees and praised the mathematical perfections of my <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Father.

Every <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> I thrilled with the <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> presence
that I clearly felt to be guiding me through Romesh. A significant
incident occurred in connection with the examination in Bengali.
Romesh, who had touched little on that subject, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> me back
one morning as I was leaving the boardinghouse on my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> to the
examination hall.

"There is Romesh shouting for you," a classmate said to me impatiently.
"Don't return; we shall be late at the hall."

Ignoring the advice, I ran back to the house.

"The Bengali examination is usually easily passed by our Bengali
boys," Romesh told me. "But I have just had a hunch that this

year the professors have planned to massacre the students by asking
questions from our ancient literature." My friend then briefly outlined
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> stories from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of Vidyasagar, a renowned philanthropist.

I thanked Romesh and quickly bicycled to the college hall.
The examination sheet in Bengali proved to contain <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> parts. The
first instruction was: "Write <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> instances of the charities of
Vidyasagar." As I transferred to the paper the lore that I had so
recently acquired, I whispered a few <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> of thanksgiving that
I had heeded Romesh's last-minute summons. Had I been ignorant of
Vidyasagar's benefactions to mankind (including ultimately myself),
I could not have passed the Bengali examination. Failing in one
subject, I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have been forced to stand examination anew in all
subjects the following year. Such a prospect was understandably
abhorrent.

The <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> instruction on the sheet read: "Write an essay in Bengali
on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> who has most inspired you." Gentle reader,
I need not inform you what <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> I chose for my theme. As I covered
page after page with praise of my guru, I smiled to realize that
my muttered prediction was coming true: "I will fill up the sheets
with your teachings!"

I had not felt inclined to question Romesh about my course in
philosophy. Trusting my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> training under Sri Yukteswar, I safely

disregarded the textbook explanations. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> mark given to
any of my papers was the one in philosophy. My score in all other
subjects was just barely <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the passing mark.

It is a pleasure to record that my unselfish friend Romesh received
his own degree CUM LAUDE.

"You spend so much <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span>

criticism of my father.

somewhat obscure. Occasionally I hear college <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> remark that

graduation. That admission consoles me a bit for my undoubted
academic deficiencies.

On the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> I received my degree from Calcutta University, I knelt
at my guru's feet and thanked him for all the blessings flowing
from his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> into mine.

"Get up, Mukunda," he said indulgently. "The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> simply found it

{FN23-1} I must do Professor Ghoshal the justice of admitting
that the strained relationship between us was not due to any fault
of his, but solely to my absences from classes and inattention
in them. Professor Ghoshal was, and is, a remarkable orator with
vast philosophical knowledge. In later <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> we came to a cordial
understanding..

{FN23-2} Although my cousin and I have the same family name of
Ghosh, Prabhas has accustomed himself to transliterating his name
in English as Ghose; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> I follow his own spelling here.

CHAPTER: 24

I BECOME A MONK OF THE SWAMI <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">ORDER</span>

"Master, my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">father</span> has been anxious for me to accept an executive

position with the Bengal-Nagpur Railway. But I have definitely
refused it." I added hopefully, "Sir, will you not make me a monk of
the Swami Order?" I looked pleadingly at my guru. During preceding
years, in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> to test the depth of my determination, he had
refused this same request. Today, however, he smiled graciously.

"Very well; tomorrow I will initiate you into swamiship." He <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span>
on quietly, "I am happy that you have persisted in your <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> to
be a monk. Lahiri Mahasaya often said: 'If you don't invite <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> to

"Dear master, I could never falter in my goal to belong to the Swami

affection.

"He that is unmarried careth for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> that belong to the Lord,
how he may please the Lord: but he that is married careth for the

analyzed the lives of many of my friends who, after undergoing
certain <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> discipline, had then married. Launched on the sea
of worldly responsibilities, they had forgotten their resolutions
to meditate deeply.

To allot <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> a secondary <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> was, to me, inconceivable.

bestow-man's love. The Creator, in taking infinite pains to shroud
with mystery His presence in every atom of creation, could have had
but one motive-a sensitive <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> seek Him only through
<span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> will. With what velvet glove of every humility has He not
covered the iron <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> of omnipotence!

The following <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> was one of the most memorable in my life. It
was a sunny Thursday, I remember, in July, 1914, a few weeks after
my graduation from college. On the inner balcony of his Serampore
hermitage, <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> dipped a new piece of white silk into a dye of
ocher, the traditional color of the Swami Order. After the cloth
had dried, my guru draped it around me as a renunciate's robe.

"Someday you will go to the West, where silk is preferred," he said.
"As a symbol, I have chosen for you this silk material instead of
the customary cotton."

In India, where monks embrace the ideal of poverty, a silk-clad
swami is an unusual sight. Many yogis, however, wear garments of
silk, which preserves certain subtle bodily currents better than
cotton.

"I am averse to ceremonies," Sri Yukteswar remarked. "I will make

you a swami in the BIDWAT (non-ceremonious) manner."

The BIBIDISA or elaborate initiation into swamiship includes a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span>
ceremony, during which symbolical funeral rites are performed. The

the flame of wisdom. The newly-made swami is then given a chant,
such as: "This ATMA is Brahma" {FN24-2} or "Thou <span class="t2 t6 t8 t9 t10 t15 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">art</span> That" or "I am
He." Sri Yukteswar, however, with his <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t8 t13 t15 t17 t18 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> of simplicity, dispensed
with all formal rites and merely asked me to select a new name.

"I will give you the privilege of choosing it yourself," he said,
smiling.

"Yogananda," I replied, after a moment's thought. The name literally
means "Bliss (ANANDA) through <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> union (YOGA)."

"Be it so. Forsaking your family name of Mukunda Lal Ghosh,
henceforth you shall be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Yogananda of the Giri branch of the

As I knelt before Sri Yukteswar, and for the first <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> him

lovingly and tirelessly had he labored, that the boy Mukunda be
someday transformed into the monk Yogananda! I joyfully sang a few
verses from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> Sanskrit chant of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> Shankara:

as active leaders, no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> can give himself the title of swami.
He rightfully receives it only from another swami; all monks <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span>

By
vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> teacher,
many Catholic Christian monastic orders resemble the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Order</span> of
Swamis.

In addition to his new name, usually ending in ANANDA, the swami
takes a title which indicates his formal connection with one of
the ten subdivisions of the Swami Order. These DASANAMIS or ten

agnomens include the GIRI (mountain), to which Sri Yukteswar, and
hence myself, belong. Among the other branches are the SAGAR (sea),
BHARATI (land), ARANYA (forest), PURI (tract), TIRTHA (place of
pilgrimage), and SARASWATI (wisdom of nature).

The new name received by a swami <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> has a twofold significance,
and represents the attainment of supreme bliss (ANANDA) through some
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> quality or state-love, wisdom, devotion, service, yoga-and
through a harmony with nature, as expressed in her infinite vastness
of oceans, mountains, skies.

The ideal of selfless service to all mankind, and of renunciation
of personal ties and ambitions, leads the majority of swamis to
engage actively in humanitarian and educational <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> in India, or
occasionally in foreign lands. Ignoring all prejudices of caste,
creed, class, color, sex, or race, a swami follows the precepts of
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> brotherhood. His goal is absolute unity with Spirit. Imbuing
his waking and sleeping <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> with the thought, "I am He,"
he roams contentedly, in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> but not of it. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> only may
he justify his title of swami-one who seeks to achieve union with
the SWA or Self. It is needless to add that not all formally titled
swamis are equally successful in reaching their <span class="t23 hoverable">high</span> goal.

Sri Yukteswar was both a swami and a yogi. A swami, formally a monk
by virtue of his connection with the ancient order, is not always

a yogi. Anyone who practices a scientific technique of God-contact
is a yogi; he may be either married or unmarried, either a worldly
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> or one of formal religious ties. A swami may conceivably follow
only the path of dry reasoning, of cold renunciation; but a yogi
engages himself in a definite, step-by-step procedure by which
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> are disciplined, and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> liberated. Taking
nothing for granted on emotional grounds, or by faith, a yogi
practices a thoroughly tested series of exercises which were first
mapped out by the early rishis. Yoga has produced, in every age
of India, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> who became truly free, truly Yogi-Christs.

Like any other science, yoga is applicable to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> of every clime
and time. The theory advanced by certain ignorant writers that yoga
is "unsuitable for Westerners" is wholly false, and has lamentably
prevented many sincere students from seeking its manifold blessings.
Yoga is a method for restraining the natural turbulence of thoughts,
which otherwise impartially prevent all men, of all lands, from
glimpsing their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of Spirit. Yoga cannot know a barrier
of East and West any more than does the healing and equitable

So <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> possesses a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> with its restless

The ancient rishi Patanjali defines "yoga" as "control of the
fluctuations of the mind-stuff." {FN24-4} His very short and masterly
expositions, the YOGA SUTRAS, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> one of the six systems of Hindu
philosophy. {FN24-5} In contradistinction to Western philosophies,
all six Hindu systems embody not only theoretical but practical
teachings. In addition to every conceivable ontological inquiry,
the six systems formulate six definite disciplines aimed at the
permanent removal of suffering and the attainment of timeless bliss.

The common thread linking all six systems is the declaration that
no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> freedom for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> is possible <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of the ultimate
Reality. The later UPANISHADS uphold the YOGA SUTRAS, among the six
systems, as containing the most efficacious methods for achieving
direct perception of truth. Through the practical techniques of
yoga, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> leaves behind forever the barren realms of speculation
and cognizes in experience the veritable Essence.

The YOGA system as outlined by Patanjali is known as the Eightfold

Path. The first steps, (1) YAMA and (2) NIYAMA, require observance
of ten negative and positive moralities-avoidance of injury to others,
of untruthfulness, of stealing, of incontinence, of gift-receiving
(which brings obligations); and purity of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> and mind, contentment,
self-discipline, study, and devotion to God.

The next steps are (3) ASANA (right posture); the spinal column
must be held straight, and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> firm in a comfortable position
for meditation; (4) PRANAYAMA (control of PRANA, subtle <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> currents);
and (5) PRATYAHARA (withdrawal of the senses from external objects).

The last steps are forms of yoga proper: (6) DHARANA (concentration);
holding the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> to one thought; (7) DHYANA (meditation), and (8)
SAMADHI (superconscious perception). This is the Eightfold Path
of Yoga {FN24-6} which leads one to the final goal of KAIVALYA
(Absoluteness), a term which might be more comprehensibly put as
"realization of the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Truth</span> beyond all intellectual apprehension."

"Which is greater," one may ask, "a swami or a yogi?" If and when
final oneness with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> is achieved, the distinctions of the various
paths disappear. The BHAGAVAD GITA, however, points out that the
methods of yoga are all-embracive. Its techniques are not meant only
for certain types and temperaments, such as those few who incline
toward the monastic life; yoga requires no formal allegiance.
Because the yogic science satisfies a universal need, it has a

natural universal applicability.

A <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> yogi may remain dutifully in the world; there he is like
butter on water, and not like the easily-diluted milk of unchurned
and undisciplined humanity. To fulfill one's earthly responsibilities
is indeed the <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> path, provided the yogi, maintaining a mental
uninvolvement with egotistical desires, plays his part as a willing
instrument of God.

a more conscious direction of one's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> and life.

Yoga has been superficially misunderstood by certain Western
writers, but its critics have never been its practitioners. Among
many thoughtful tributes to yoga may be mentioned one by Dr. C. G.
Jung, the famous Swiss psychologist.

"When a religious method recommends itself as 'scientific,' it can
be certain of its public in the West. Yoga fulfills this expectation,"
Dr. Jung writes. {FN24-7} "Quite apart from the charm of the new,
and the fascination of the half-understood, there is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> cause
for Yoga to have many adherents. It offers the possibility of
controllable experience, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> satisfies the scientific need
of 'facts,' and besides this, by <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> of its breadth and depth,
its venerable age, its doctrine and method, which include every
phase of life, it promises undreamed-of possibilities.

"Every religious or philosophical practice means a psychological
discipline, that is, a method of mental hygiene. The manifold,
purely bodily procedures of Yoga {FN24-8} also mean a physiological
hygiene which is superior to ordinary gymnastics and breathing
exercises, inasmuch as it is not merely mechanistic and scientific,
but also philosophical; in its training of the parts of the body,

for instance, in the PRANAYAMA exercises where PRANA is both the
breath and the universal dynamics of the cosmos.

"When the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> which the individual is doing is also a cosmic event,

develops a lively unity which no technique, however scientific, can
produce. Yoga practice is unthinkable, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> also be ineffectual,

CHAPTER: 25

BROTHER ANANTA AND SISTER NALINI

"Ananta cannot live; the sands of his karma for this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> have run
out."

These inexorable <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> reached my inner <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> as I sat one
morning in deep meditation. Shortly after I had entered the Swami
Order, I paid a visit to my birthplace, Gorakhpur, as a guest of
my elder brother Ananta. A sudden illness confined him to his bed;
I nursed him lovingly.

The solemn inward pronouncement filled me with grief. I felt that
I could not bear to remain longer in Gorakhpur, only to see my
brother removed before my helpless gaze. Amidst uncomprehending
criticism from my relatives, I <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> India on the first available
boat. It cruised along Burma and the China Sea to Japan. I disembarked
at Kobe, where I spent only a few days. My <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> was too heavy for
sightseeing.

On the return trip to India, the boat touched at Shanghai. There
Dr. Misra, the ship's physician, guided me to several curio shops,
where I selected various presents for Sri Yukteswar and my family
and friends. For Ananta I purchased a large carved bamboo piece.
No sooner had the Chinese salesman handed me the bamboo souvenir
than I dropped it on the floor, crying out, "I have bought this
for my dear dead brother!"

A clear realization had swept over me that his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> was just being
freed in the Infinite. The souvenir was sharply and symbolically
cracked by its fall; amidst sobs, I wrote on the bamboo surface:
"For my beloved Ananta, now gone."

My companion, the doctor, was observing these proceedings with a
sardonic smile.

"Save your tears," he remarked. "Why shed them until you are sure
he is dead?"

When our boat reached Calcutta, Dr. Misra again accompanied me. My
youngest brother Bishnu was waiting to greet me at the dock.

"I know Ananta has departed this life," I said to Bishnu, before he
had had <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> to speak. "Please tell me, and the doctor here, when
Ananta died."

Bishnu named the date, which was the very <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> that I had bought
the souvenirs in Shanghai.

"Look here!" Dr. Misra ejaculated. "Don't let any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> of this
get around! The professors will be adding a year's study of mental
telepathy to the medical course, which is already <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> enough!"

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Father</span> embraced me warmly as I entered our Gurpar Road home. "You
have come," he said tenderly. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Two</span> large tears dropped from his
eyes. Ordinarily undemonstrative, he had never before shown me
these signs of affection. Outwardly the grave father, inwardly he
possessed the melting <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> of a mother. In all his dealings with
the family, his dual parental role was distinctly manifest.

Soon after Ananta's passing, my younger sister Nalini was <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span>
back from death's door by a <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> healing. Before relating the
story, I will refer to a few phases of her earlier life.

The childhood relationship between Nalini and myself had not been
of the happiest nature. I was very thin; she was thinner still.
Through an unconscious motive or "complex" which psychiatrists will
have no difficulty in identifying, I often <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> to tease my sister
about her cadaverous appearance. Her retorts were equally permeated
with the callous frankness of extreme youth. Sometimes Mother

intervened, ending the childish quarrels, temporarily, by a gentle
box on my ear, as the elder ear.

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Time</span> passed; Nalini was betrothed to a young Calcutta physician,
Panchanon Bose. He received a generous dowry from Father, presumably
(as I remarked to Sister) to compensate the bridegroom-to-be for
his fate in allying himself with a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> bean-pole.

Elaborate marriage rites were celebrated in due time. On the wedding
night, I joined the large and jovial group of relatives in the
living room of our Calcutta home. The bridegroom was leaning on an
immense gold-brocaded pillow, with Nalini at his side. A gorgeous
purple silk SARI {FN25-1} could not, alas, wholly hide her angularity.
I sheltered myself behind the pillow of my new brother-in-law and
grinned at him in friendly fashion. He had never seen Nalini until
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> of the nuptial ceremony, when he finally learned what he
was getting in the matrimonial lottery.

Feeling my sympathy, Dr. Bose pointed unobtrusively to Nalini, and
whispered in my ear, "Say, what's this?"

"Why, Doctor," I replied, "it is a skeleton for your observation!"

Convulsed with mirth, my brother-in-law and I were hard put to it
to maintain the proper decorum before our assembled relatives.

As the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> on, Dr. Bose endeared himself to our family, who
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> on him whenever illness arose. He and I became fast friends,
often joking together, usually with Nalini as our target.

"It is a medical curiosity," my brother-in-law remarked to me one
day. "I have tried everything on your lean sister-cod liver oil,
butter, malt, honey, fish, meat, eggs, tonics. Still she fails to
bulge even one-hundredth of an inch." We both chuckled.

A few <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">days</span> later I visited the Bose home. My errand there <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> only
a few minutes; I was leaving, unnoticed, I thought, by Nalini. As
I reached the front door, I <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> her voice, cordial but commanding.

"Brother, come here. You are not going to give me the slip this
time. I want to talk to you."

I mounted the stairs to her room. To my surprise, she was in tears.

"Dear brother," she said, "let us bury the old hatchet. I see that
your feet are now firmly <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> path. I want to become
like you in every way." She added hopefully, "You are now robust
in appearance; can you help me? My husband does not come near me,
and I <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t8 t13 t15 t17 t18 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> him so dearly! But still more I want to progress in
God-realization, even if I must remain thin {FN25-2} and unattractive."

My <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> was deeply touched at her plea. Our new friendship steadily
progressed; one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> she asked to become my disciple.

"Train me in any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> you like. I put my trust in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> instead of
tonics." She gathered <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> an armful of medicines and poured
them down the roof drain.

As a test of her faith, I asked her to omit from her diet all fish,
meat, and eggs.

After several months, during which Nalini had strictly followed
the various rules I had outlined, and had adhered to her vegetarian
diet in spite of numerous difficulties, I paid her a visit.

"Sis, you have been conscientiously observing the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span>
injunctions; your reward is near." I smiled mischievously. "How
plump do you want to be-as fat as our aunt who hasn't seen her feet
in years?"

"No! But I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> to be as stout as you are."

I replied solemnly. "By the grace of God, as I have spoken <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span>
always, I <span class="t9 t11 t20 t21 t22 t23 t27 hoverable">speak</span> truly now. {FN25-3} Through the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> blessings,
your <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> shall verily change from today; in one month it shall

have the same weight as mine."

These <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> from my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> found fulfillment. In thirty days, Nalini's
weight equalled mine. The new roundness gave her beauty; her husband
fell deeply in love. Their marriage, begun so inauspiciously, turned
out to be ideally happy.

On my return from Japan, I learned that during my absence Nalini
had been stricken with typhoid fever. I rushed to her home, and was
aghast to <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> her reduced to a mere skeleton. She was in a coma.

"Before her <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> became confused by illness," my brother-in-law
told me, "she often said: 'If brother Mukunda were here, I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span>
not be faring thus.'" He added despairingly, "The other doctors
and myself see no hope. Blood dysentery has <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> in, after her <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span>
bout with typhoid."

I began to move <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heaven</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> with my prayers. Engaging
an Anglo-Indian nurse, who gave me <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span> cooperation, I applied to
my sister various yoga techniques of healing. The blood dysentery
disappeared.

But Dr. Bose shook his <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> mournfully. "She simply has no more
blood <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> to shed."

"She will recover," I replied stoutly. "In seven <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">days</span> her fever
will be gone."

A week later I was thrilled to see Nalini open her <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> and gaze at
me with loving recognition. From that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> her recovery was swift.
Although she regained her usual weight, she bore one sad scar of her
nearly fatal illness: her legs were paralyzed. Indian and English
specialists pronounced her a hopeless cripple.

The incessant war for her <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> which I had waged by prayer had
exhausted me. I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> to Serampore to ask Sri Yukteswar's help. His
<span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> expressed deep sympathy as I told him of Nalini's plight.

"Your sister's legs will be normal at the end of one month." He
added, "Let her wear, next to her skin, a band with an unperforated
two-carat pearl, held on by a clasp."

I prostrated myself at his feet with joyful relief.

"Sir, you are a master; your <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> of her recovery is enough But if
you insist I shall immediately get her a pearl."

My guru nodded. "Yes, do that." He <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> on to correctly describe
the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> and mental characteristics of Nalini, whom he had
never seen.

"Sir," I inquired, "is this an astrological analysis? You do not
know her birth <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> or hour."

Sri Yukteswar smiled. "There is a deeper astrology, not dependent
on the testimony of calendars and clocks. Each <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> is a part of
the Creator, or Cosmic Man; he has a heavenly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as one
of earth. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> eye sees the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> form, but the inward eye
penetrates more profoundly, even to the universal pattern of which
each <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> is an integral and individual part."

I returned to Calcutta and purchased a pearl for Nalini. A month
later, her paralyzed legs were completely healed.

Sister asked me to convey her heartfelt gratitude to my guru. He
listened to her message in silence. But as I was taking my leave,
he made a pregnant comment.

"Your sister has been told by many doctors that she can never bear
children. Assure her that in a few <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> she will give birth to

Some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> later, to Nalini's joy, she bore a girl, followed in a

"Your <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> has <span class="t11 hoverable">blessed</span> our home, our entire family," my sister
said. "The presence of such a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> is a sanctification on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span>

CHAPTER: 26

THE SCIENCE OF KRIYA YOGA

The science of KRIYA YOGA, mentioned so often in these pages, became
widely known in modern India through the instrumentality of Lahiri
Mahasaya, my guru's guru. The Sanskrit root of KRIYA is KRI, to
do, to act and react; the same root is found in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> KARMA, the
natural principle of cause and effect. KRIYA YOGA is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> "union

(yoga) with the Infinite through a certain action or rite." A yogi
who faithfully follows its technique is gradually freed from karma
or the universal chain of causation.

Because of certain ancient yogic injunctions, I cannot give a <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span>
explanation of KRIYA YOGA in the pages of a <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">book</span> intended for the
general public. The actual technique must be learned from a KRIYABAN
or KRIYA YOGI; here a broad reference must suffice.

KRIYA YOGA is a simple, psychophysiological method by which the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> blood is decarbonized and recharged with oxygen. The atoms
of this extra oxygen are transmuted into <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> current to rejuvenate
the brain and spinal centers. {FN26-1} By stopping the accumulation
of venous blood, the yogi is able to lessen or prevent the decay of
tissues; the advanced yogi transmutes his cells into pure energy.
Elijah, Jesus, Kabir and other prophets were past masters in the
<span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> of KRIYA or a similar technique, by which they caused their
bodies to dematerialize at will.

KRIYA is an ancient science. Lahiri Mahasaya received it from his
guru, Babaji, who rediscovered and clarified the technique after
it had been lost in the Dark Ages.

"The KRIYA YOGA which I am giving to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> through you in this
nineteenth century," Babaji told Lahiri Mahasaya, "is a revival of

the same science which Krishna gave, millenniums ago, to Arjuna,
and which was later known to Patanjali, and to Christ, St. John,
St. Paul, and other disciples."

KRIYA YOGA is referred to by Krishna, India's greatest prophet, in
a stanza of the BHAGAVAD GITA: "Offering inhaling breath into the
outgoing breath, and <span class="t22 t23 t28 hoverable">offering</span> the outgoing breath into the inhaling
breath, the yogi neutralizes both these breaths; he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> releases
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> force from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> and brings it under his control."
{FN26-2} The interpretation is: "The yogi arrests decay in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span>
by an addition of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> force, and arrests the mutations of growth
in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> by APAN (eliminating current). <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> neutralizing decay
and growth, by quieting the heart, the yogi learns <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> control."

Krishna also relates {FN26-3} that it was he, in a former incarnation,
who communicated the indestructible yoga to an ancient illuminato,
Vivasvat, who gave it to Manu, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> legislator. {FN26-4} He,
in turn, instructed Ikshwaku, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">father</span> of India's solar warrior
dynasty. Passing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> from one to another, the royal yoga was
guarded by the rishis until the coming of the materialistic ages.
{FN26-5} Then, due to priestly secrecy and man's indifference, the
sacred <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> gradually became inaccessible.

KRIYA YOGA is mentioned twice by the ancient sage Patanjali, foremost
exponent of yoga, who wrote: "KRIYA YOGA consists of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> discipline,

mental control, and meditating on AUM." {FN26-6} Patanjali speaks
of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> as the actual Cosmic Sound of AUM <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> in meditation. {FN26-7}
AUM is the Creative Word, {FN26-8} the sound of the Vibratory Motor.
Even the yoga-beginner soon inwardly hears the wondrous sound of
AUM. Receiving this blissful <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> encouragement, the devotee
becomes assured that he is in actual touch with <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> realms.

Patanjali refers a <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> to the life-control or KRIYA technique
thus: "Liberation can be accomplished by that PRANAYAMA which is
attained by disjoining the course of inspiration and expiration."
{FN26-9}

St. Paul knew KRIYA YOGA, or a technique very similar to it, by
which he could switch <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> currents to and from the senses. He was
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> able to say: "Verily, I protest by our rejoicing which
I have in Christ, I DIE DAILY." {FN26-10} By daily withdrawing his
bodily <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> force, he united it by yoga union with the rejoicing
(eternal bliss) of the <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Christ</span> consciousness. In that felicitous
state, he was consciously aware of being dead to the delusive
sensory <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> of MAYA.

In the initial states of God-contact (SABIKALPA SAMADHI) the
devotee's <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> merges with the Cosmic Spirit; his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span>
force is withdrawn from the body, which appears "dead," or motionless
and rigid. The yogi is fully aware of his bodily condition of

suspended animation. As he progresses to <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> states
(NIRBIKALPA SAMADHI), however, he communes with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> bodily
fixation, and in his ordinary waking consciousness, even in the
midst of exacting worldly duties. {FN26-11}

"KRIYA YOGA is an instrument through which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> evolution can be
quickened," Sri Yukteswar explained to his students. "The ancient
yogis discovered that the secret of cosmic <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> is
intimately linked with breath mastery. This is India's unique and
deathless contribution to the world's treasury of knowledge. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span>
force, which is ordinarily absorbed in maintaining the heart-pump,
must be freed for <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> activities by a method of calming and
stilling the ceaseless demands of the breath."

The KRIYA YOGI mentally directs his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> energy to revolve, upward

cut, of course, can be <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> only by deeply developed yogis. With
the guidance of a guru, such yogis have carefully prepared their
bodies and brains to receive the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> <span class="t16 hoverable">created</span> by intensive practice.

The KRIYA beginner employs his yogic exercise only fourteen to
twenty-eight times, twice daily. A <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> of yogis achieve emancipation
in six or twelve or twenty-four or forty-eight years. A yogi who
dies before achieving <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span> realization carries with him the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span>

of KRIYA. Through gradual and regular increase of the simple and
"foolproof" methods of KRIYA, man's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> becomes astrally transformed

of cosmic energy-the first materially active expression of Spirit.

KRIYA YOGA has nothing in common with the unscientific breathing
exercises taught by a <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> of misguided zealots. Their attempts
to forcibly hold breath in the lungs is not only unnatural but
decidedly unpleasant. KRIYA, on the other hand, is accompanied
from the very beginning by an accession of peace, and by soothing
sensations of regenerative effect in the spine.

The ancient yogic technique converts the breath into mind. By
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> advancement, one is able to cognize the breath as an act
of mind-a dream-breath.

Many illustrations could be given of the mathematical relationship
between man's respiratory rate and the variations in his states of
consciousness. A <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> attention is wholly engrossed, as in
following some closely knit intellectual argument, or in attempting
some delicate or difficult <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> feat, automatically breathes
very slowly. Fixity of attention depends on slow breathing; quick
or uneven breaths are an inevitable accompaniment of harmful
emotional states: fear, lust, anger. The restless monkey breathes

at the rate of 32 times a minute, in contrast to man's average of
18 times. The elephant, tortoise, snake and other animals noted for
their longevity have a respiratory rate which is less than man's.
The tortoise, for instance, who may attain the age of 300 years,
{FN26-12} breathes only 4 times per minute.

The rejuvenating effects of sleep are due to man's temporary
unawareness of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> and breathing. The sleeping <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> becomes a yogi;
each night he unconsciously performs the yogic rite of releasing
himself from bodily identification, and of merging the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> force
with healing currents in the main brain region and the six sub-dynamos
of his spinal centers. The sleeper <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> dips unknowingly into the
reservoir of cosmic energy which sustains all life.

The voluntary yogi performs a simple, natural process consciously,
not unconsciously like the slow-paced sleeper. The KRIYA YOGI uses
his technique to saturate and feed all his <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> cells with
undecaying <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> and keep them in a magnetized state. He scientifically
makes breath unnecessary, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> producing the states of subconscious
sleep or unconsciousness.

By KRIYA, the outgoing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> force is not wasted and abused in the
senses, but constrained to reunite with subtler spinal energies.
By such reinforcement of life, the yogi's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> and brain cells
are electrified with the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> elixir. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> he removes himself

from studied observance of natural laws, which can only <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> him-by
circuitous means as given by proper food, sunlight, and harmonious
thoughts-to a million-year Goal. It needs twelve <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> of normal
healthful living to effect even slight perceptible change in brain
structure, and a million solar returns are exacted to sufficiently
refine the cerebral tenement for manifestation of cosmic consciousness.

Untying the cord of breath which binds the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> to the body, KRIYA
serves to prolong <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> and enlarge the <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> to infinity.
The yoga method overcomes the tug of war between the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> and the
matter-bound senses, and frees the devotee to reinherit his <span class="t20 hoverable">eternal</span>
kingdom. He knows his real <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> is bound neither by <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span>

Introspection, or "sitting in the silence," is an unscientific

divinity, is constantly dragged back toward the senses by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span>

force, is the easiest, most effective, and most scientific avenue
of approach to the Infinite. In contrast to the slow, uncertain
"bullock cart" theological path to God, KRIYA may justly be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span>

The yogic science is based on an empirical consideration of all
forms of concentration and <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> exercises. Yoga enables the

regents in the six spinal centers or spheres of consciousness. This

intellectual reactions, feelings, moods, and habits are circumscribed
by effects of past causes, <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> of this or a prior life. Lofty
above such influences, however, is his regal soul. Spurning the
transitory truths and freedoms, the KRIYA YOGI passes beyond all
disillusionment into his unfettered Being. All scriptures declare
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> to be not a corruptible body, but a living soul; by KRIYA he
is given a method to prove the scriptural truth.

"Outward ritual cannot destroy ignorance, because they are not
mutually contradictory," wrote Shankara in his famous CENTURY OF
VERSES. "Realized <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> alone destroys ignorance. . . . <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Knowledge</span>
cannot spring up by any other means than inquiry. 'Who am I? How
was this universe born? Who is its maker? What is its material
cause?' This is the kind of inquiry referred to." The intellect
has no answer for these questions; hence the rishis evolved yoga
as the technique of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> inquiry.

KRIYA YOGA is the real "fire rite" often extolled in the BHAGAVAD
GITA. The purifying fires of yoga <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> <span class="t20 hoverable">eternal</span> illumination, and

chanted accompaniment, along with the incense!

false identification with bodily desires, uniting his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> with

receives fulfillment of his Supreme Desire, safe in the final haven
of inexhaustibly blissful Spirit.

The yogi offers his labyrinthine <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> longings to a monotheistic

CHAPTER: 27

FOUNDING A YOGA SCHOOL AT RANCHI

"Why are you averse to organizational work?"

Master's question startled me a bit. It is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> that my private

"It is a thankless task, sir," I answered. "No <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> what the
leader does or does not, he is criticized."

"Do you want the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> CHANNA (milk curd) for yourself alone?"
My guru's retort was accompanied by a stern glance. "Could you or
anyone else achieve God-contact through yoga if a line of generous-hearted
masters had not been willing to convey their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> to others?"
He added, "God is the Honey, organizations are the hives; both are
necessary. Any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">FORM</span> is useless, of course, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> the spirit, but
why should you not start busy hives <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> nectar?"

His counsel moved me deeply. Although I made no outward reply, an
adamant resolution arose in my breast: I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> share with my fellows,
so far as lay in my power, the unshackling truths I had learned at
my guru's feet. "Lord," I prayed, "may <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thy</span> <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t8 t13 t15 t17 t18 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">Love</span> shine forever on
the sanctuary of my devotion, and may I be able to awaken that <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t8 t13 t15 t17 t18 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">Love</span>
in other hearts."

On a previous occasion, before I had joined the monastic order,
Sri Yukteswar had made a most unexpected remark.

"How you will miss the companionship of a wife in your old age!" he
had said. "Do you not agree that the family man, engaged in useful
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> to maintain his wife and children, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> plays a rewarding role
in God's eyes?"

"Sir," I had protested in alarm, "you know that my <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> in this
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> is to espouse only the Cosmic Beloved."

<span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> had laughed so merrily that I understood his observation
was made merely as a test of my faith.

"Remember," he had said slowly, "that he who discards his worldly
duties can justify himself only by assuming some kind of responsibility
toward a much larger family."

The ideal of an all-sided education for youth had always been close
to my heart. I saw clearly the arid results of ordinary instruction,
aimed only at the development of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> and intellect. Moral and
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> values, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> appreciation no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> can approach

found a school where young boys could develop to the <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span> stature
of manhood. My first step in that direction was made with seven
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">children</span> at Dihika, a small country site in Bengal.

A year later, in 1918, through the generosity of Sir Manindra
Chandra Nundy, the Maharaja of Kasimbazar, I was able to transfer my
fast-growing group to Ranchi. This town in Bihar, about <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> hundred
miles from Calcutta, is <span class="t11 hoverable">blessed</span> with one of the most healthful
climates in India. The Kasimbazar Palace at Ranchi was transformed

into the headquarters for the new school, which I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> BRAHMACHARYA
VIDYALAYA {FN27-1} in accordance with the educational ideals
of the rishis. Their forest ashrams had been the ancient seats of
learning, secular and divine, for the youth of India.

At Ranchi I organized an educational program for both grammar
and <span class="t23 hoverable">high</span> school grades. It included agricultural, industrial,
commercial, and academic subjects. The students were also taught
yoga concentration and meditation, and a unique system of <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span>
development, "Yogoda," <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> principles I had discovered in 1916.

Realizing that man's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> is like an electric battery, I reasoned
that it could be recharged with energy through the direct agency of
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> will. As no action, slight or large, is possible <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span>
WILLING, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> can avail himself of his prime mover, will, to renew
his bodily tissues <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> burdensome apparatus or mechanical
exercises. I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> taught the Ranchi students my simple "Yogoda"
techniques by which the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> force, centred in man's medulla
oblongata, can be consciously and instantly recharged from the
unlimited supply of cosmic energy.

The boys responded wonderfully to this training, developing
extraordinary ability to shift the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> energy from one part of
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> to another part, and to sit in perfect poise in difficult

endurance which many powerful adults could not equal. My youngest
brother, Bishnu Charan Ghosh, joined the Ranchi school; he later
became a leading <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> culturist in Bengal. He and one of his
students traveled to Europe and America, giving exhibitions of
strength and skill which amazed the university savants, including
those at Columbia University in New York.

At the end of the first year at Ranchi, applications for admission
reached <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> thousand. But the school, which at that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> was solely
residential, could accommodate only about one hundred. Instruction
for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> students was soon added.

In the VIDYALAYA I had to play father-mother to the little children,
and to cope with many organizational difficulties. I often remembered
Christ's words: "Verily I say <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">unto</span> you, There is no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> that <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hath</span>

and in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> to come <span class="t20 hoverable">eternal</span> life." {FN27-3} Sri Yukteswar had
interpreted these words: "The devotee who forgoes the life-experiences
of marriage and family, and exchanges the problems of a small
household and limited activities for the larger responsibilities
of service to <span class="t1 hoverable">society</span> in general, is undertaking a task which is
often accompanied by persecution from a misunderstanding world,

but also by a <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> inner contentment."

One <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">father</span> arrived in Ranchi to bestow a paternal blessing,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> withheld because I had hurt him by refusing his offer of a
position with the Bengal-Nagpur Railway.

"Son," he said, "I am now reconciled to your choice in life. It gives
me joy to see you amidst these happy, eager youngsters; you belong
here rather than with the lifeless figures of railroad timetables."
He waved toward a group of a dozen little ones who were tagging at
my heels. "I had only eight children," he observed with twinkling
eyes, "but I can feel for you!"

With a large fruit orchard and twenty-five fertile acres at our
disposal, the students, teachers, and myself enjoyed many happy
hours of outdoor labor in these ideal surroundings. We had many pets,

including a young deer who was fairly idolized by the children. I
too loved the fawn so much that I allowed it to sleep in my room.
At the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> of dawn, the little creature <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> toddle over to my
bed for a morning caress.

One <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> I fed the pet earlier than usual, as I had to attend to
some business in the town of Ranchi. Although I cautioned the boys
not to feed the fawn until my return, one of them was disobedient,
and gave the baby deer a large quantity of milk. When I came back
in the evening, sad news greeted me: "The little fawn is nearly
dead, through over feeding."

In tears, I placed the apparently lifeless pet on my lap. I prayed
piteously to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> to spare its life. Hours later, the small creature
opened its eyes, stood up, and walked feebly. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> school
shouted for joy.

But a deep lesson came to me that night, one I can never forget.
I stayed up with the fawn until <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> o'clock, when I fell asleep.
The deer appeared in a dream, and spoke to me:

"You are holding me back. Please let me go; let me go!"

"All right," I answered in the dream.

I awoke immediately, and cried out, "Boys, the deer is dying!" The
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">children</span> rushed to my side.

I ran to the corner of the room where I had placed the pet. It
made a last effort to rise, stumbled toward me, then dropped at my
feet, dead.

According to the mass karma which guides and regulates the destinies
of animals, the deer's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> was over, and it was ready to progress
to a <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> form. But by my deep attachment, which I later realized
was selfish, and by my fervent prayers, I had been able to hold
it in the limitations of the animal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> from which the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> was
struggling for release. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> of the deer made its plea in a
dream because, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> my loving permission, it either <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> not
or could not go. As soon as I agreed, it departed.

All sorrow <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> me; I realized anew that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> wants His <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">children</span> to

The ignorant <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> sees only the unsurmountable wall
of death, hiding, seemingly forever, his cherished friends. But
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> of unattachment, he who loves others as expressions of the

for a breathing-space of joy in Him.

The Ranchi school grew from small and simple beginnings to an
institution now well-known in India. Many departments of the school
are supported by voluntary contributions from those who rejoice in
perpetuating the educational ideals of the rishis. Under the general
name of YOGODA SAT-SANGA, {FN27-4} flourishing branch schools have
been established at Midnapore, Lakshmanpur, and Puri.

The Ranchi headquarters maintains a Medical Department where
medicines and the services of doctors are supplied freely to the
poor of the locality. The <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> treated has averaged more than
18,000 persons a year. The VIDYALAYA has made its mark, too, in
Indian competitive sports, and in the scholastic field, where many
Ranchi alumni have distinguished themselves in later university
life.

The school, now in its twenty-eighth year and the center of many
activities, {FN27-5} has been honored by visits of eminent <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span>

As the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> viewed
the picturesque outdoor classes, held under the trees, and saw in
the evening that young boys were sitting motionless for hours in
yoga meditation, he was profoundly moved.

"Joy comes to my heart," he said, "to see that Lahiri Mahasaya's

ideals for the proper training of youth are being carried on in
this institution. My guru's blessings be on it."

A young lad sitting by my <span class="t6 hoverable">side</span> ventured to ask the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> yogi a
question.

"Sir," he said, "shall I be a monk? Is my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> only for God?"

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Though</span> Swami Pranabananda smiled gently, his <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> were piercing
the future.

"Child," he replied, "when you grow up, there is a beautiful bride
waiting for you." The boy did eventually marry, after having planned
for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> to enter the Swami Order.

Sometime after Swami Pranabananda had visited Ranchi, I accompanied
my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">father</span> to the Calcutta <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> where the yogi was temporarily
staying. Pranabananda's prediction, made to me so many <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> before,
came rushing to my mind: "I shall see you, with your father, later
on."

As <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Father</span> entered the swami's room, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> yogi rose from his
seat and embraced my parent with loving respect.

"Bhagabati," he said, "what are you doing about yourself? Don't you

see your <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> racing to the Infinite?" I blushed to hear his praise
before my father. The swami <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> on, "You recall how often our

The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> of Pranabananda, which had appeared so <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> and strong

"Swamiji," I inquired, looking straight into his eyes, "please tell
me the truth: Aren't you feeling the advance of age? As the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span>

He smiled angelically. "The Beloved is more than ever with me now."
His complete conviction overwhelmed my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> and soul.

one from above." Pointing his finger heavenward, the saint fell
into an ecstasy, his face lit with a <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> glow-an ample answer
to my question.

Noticing that Pranabananda's room contained many plants and packages
of seed, I asked their purpose.

"I have <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> Benares permanently," he said, "and am now on my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span>
to the Himalayas. There I shall open an ashram for my disciples.

These seeds will produce spinach and a few other vegetables. My dear
ones will live simply, spending their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> in blissful God-union.
Nothing else is necessary."

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Father</span> asked his brother disciple when he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> return to Calcutta.

"Never again," the saint replied. "This year is the one in which
Lahiri Mahasaya told me I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> leave my beloved Benares forever
and go to the Himalayas, there to throw off my mortal frame."

My <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> filled with tears at his words, but the swami smiled
tranquilly. He reminded me of a little heavenly child, sitting
securely on the lap of the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Mother.

has no ill effect on a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> yogi's <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span> possession of supreme

He is able to renew his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> at will; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> sometimes
he does not care to retard the aging process, but allows his karma
to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> itself out on the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> plane, using his old <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> as a
time-saving device to exclude the necessity of working out karma
in a new incarnation.

Months later I met an old friend, Sanandan, who was one of
Pranabananda's close disciples.

"My adorable guru is gone," he told me, amidst sobs. "He established

a hermitage near Rishikesh, and gave us loving training. When we
were pretty <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> settled, and making rapid <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> progress in his
company, he proposed one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> to feed a huge crowd from Rishikesh.
I inquired why he wanted such a large number.

"'This is my last festival ceremony,' he said. I did not understand
the <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span> implications of his words.

"Pranabanandaji helped with the cooking of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> amounts of food.
We fed about 2000 guests. After the feast, he sat on a <span class="t23 hoverable">high</span> platform
and gave an inspired sermon on the Infinite. At the end, before
the gaze of thousands, he turned to me, as I sat beside him on the
dais, and spoke with unusual force.

"'Sanandan, be prepared; I am going to kick the frame.' {FN27-7}

"After a stunned silence, I cried loudly, 'Master, don't do it!
Please, please, don't do it!' The crowd was tongue-tied, watching
us curiously. My guru smiled at me, but his solemn gaze was already
fixed on Eternity.

"'Be not selfish,' he said, 'nor grieve for me. I have been <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span>
cheerfully serving you all; now rejoice and wish me Godspeed. I
go to meet my Cosmic Beloved.' In a whisper, Pranabanandaji added,
'I shall be reborn shortly. After enjoying a short period of the

Infinite Bliss, I shall return to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> and join Babaji. {FN27-8}
You shall soon know when and where my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> has been encased in a
new body.'

"He cried again, 'Sanandan, here I kick the frame by the <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span>
KRIYA YOGA.' {FN27-9}

"He looked at the sea of faces before us, and gave a blessing.
Directing his gaze inwardly to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> eye, he became immobile.
While the bewildered crowd <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> he was meditating in an ecstatic
state, he had already <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> the tabernacle of <span class="t21 hoverable">flesh</span> and plunged
his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> into the cosmic vastness. The disciples touched his body,
seated in the lotus posture, but it was no longer the warm flesh.
Only a stiffened frame remained; the tenant had fled to the immortal
shore."

I inquired where Pranabananda was to be reborn.

"That's a sacred trust I cannot divulge to anyone," Sanandan replied.
"Perhaps you may <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> out some other way."

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Years</span> later I discovered from Swami Keshabananda {FN27-10} that

CHAPTER: 28

KASHI, REBORN AND REDISCOVERED

"Please do not go into the water. Let us bathe by dipping our

buckets."

I was addressing the young Ranchi students who were accompanying
me on an eight-mile hike to a neighboring hill. The pond before
us was inviting, but a distaste for it had arisen in my mind. The
group around me followed my example of dipping buckets, but a few
lads yielded to the temptation of the cool waters. No sooner had
they dived than large <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> snakes wiggled around them. The boys
came out of the pond with comical alacrity.

We enjoyed a picnic lunch after we reached our destination. I sat
under a tree, surrounded by a group of students. Finding me in an
inspirational mood, they plied me with questions.

"Please tell me, sir," one youth inquired, "if I shall always stay
with you in the path of renunciation."

"Ah, no," I replied, "you will be forcibly <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> away to your home,
and later you will marry."

Incredulous, he made a vehement protest. "Only if I am dead can I
be carried home." But in a few months, his parents arrived to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span>
him away, in spite of his tearful resistance; some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> later, he
did marry.

After answering many questions, I was addressed by a lad named
Kashi. He was about twelve <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> old, a brilliant student, and
beloved by all.

"Sir," he said, "what will be my fate?"

"You shall soon be dead." The reply came from my lips with an
irresistible force.

This unexpected disclosure shocked and grieved me as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as
everyone present. Silently rebuking myself as an ENFANT TERRIBLE,
I refused to answer further questions.

On our return to the school, Kashi came to my room.

"If I die, will you <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> me when I am reborn, and <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> me again
to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> path?" He sobbed.

I felt constrained to refuse this difficult occult responsibility.
But for weeks afterward, Kashi pressed me doggedly. Seeing him
unnerved to the breaking point, I finally consoled him.

"Yes," I promised. "If the Heavenly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Father</span> lends His aid, I will
try to <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> you."

During the summer vacation, I started on a short trip. Regretting
that I could not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> Kashi with me, I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> him to my room
before leaving, and carefully instructed him to remain, against
all persuasion, in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> vibrations of the school. Somehow
I felt that if he did not go home, he might avoid the impending
calamity.

No sooner had I <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> than Kashi's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">father</span> arrived in Ranchi. For
fifteen <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">days</span> he tried to break the will of his son, explaining that
if Kashi <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> go to Calcutta for only four <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">days</span> to see his mother,
he could then return. Kashi persistently refused. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">father</span> finally
said he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> the boy away with the help of the police. The
threat disturbed Kashi, who was unwilling to be the cause of any
unfavorable publicity to the school. He saw no choice but to go.

I returned to Ranchi a few <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">days</span> later. When I <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> how Kashi had
been removed, I entrained at once for Calcutta. There I engaged a
horse cab. Very strangely, as the vehicle passed beyond the Howrah
bridge over the Ganges, I beheld Kashi's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">father</span> and other relatives
in mourning clothes. Shouting to my driver to stop, I rushed out
and glared at the unfortunate father.

"Mr. Murderer," I cried somewhat unreasonably, "you have killed my
boy!"

The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">father</span> had already realized the wrong he had done in forcibly
bringing Kashi to Calcutta. During the few <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">days</span> the boy had been
there, he had eaten contaminated food, contracted cholera, and
passed on.

My <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t8 t13 t15 t17 t18 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> for Kashi, and the pledge to <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> him after death, night and
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> haunted me. No <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> where I went, his face loomed up before
me. I began a memorable search for him, even as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> ago I had
searched for my lost mother.

I felt that inasmuch as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> had given me the faculty of reason, I
must utilize it and tax my powers to the utmost in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> to discover
the subtle laws by which I could know the boy's astral whereabouts.
He was a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> vibrating with unfulfilled desires, I realized-a mass
of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> floating somewhere amidst millions of luminous souls in
the astral regions. How was I to tune in with him, among so many
vibrating lights of other souls?

Using a secret yoga technique, I broadcasted my <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t8 t13 t15 t17 t18 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> to Kashi's
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> through the microphone of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> eye, the inner point
between the eyebrows. With the antenna of upraised <span class="t13 t23 hoverable">hands</span> and
fingers, I often turned myself round and round, trying to locate
the direction in which he had been reborn as an embryo. I hoped to
receive response from him in the concentration-tuned radio of my
heart. {FN28-1}

I intuitively felt that Kashi <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> soon return to the earth, and
that if I kept unceasingly broadcasting my <span class="t3 t11 t18 t27 hoverable">call</span> to him, his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span>
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> reply. I knew that the slightest impulse sent by Kashi <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span>
be felt in my fingers, hands, arms, spine, and nerves.

With undiminished zeal, I practiced the yoga method steadily for
about six months after Kashi's death. Walking with a few friends
one morning in the crowded Bowbazar section of Calcutta, I lifted
my <span class="t13 t23 hoverable">hands</span> in the usual manner. For the first time, there was response.

I thrilled to detect electrical impulses trickling down my fingers
and palms. These currents translated themselves into one overpowering
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> from a deep recess of my consciousness: "I am Kashi; I am
Kashi; come to me!"

The <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> became almost audible as I concentrated on my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span>
radio. In the characteristic, slightly hoarse whisper of Kashi,
{FN28-2} I <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> his summons again and again. I seized the arm
of one of my companions, Prokash Das, {FN28-3} and smiled at him
joyfully.

"It looks as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> I have located Kashi!"

I began to turn round and round, to the undisguised amusement of
my friends and the passing throng. The electrical impulses tingled
through my fingers only when I faced toward a near-by path, aptly
named "Serpentine Lane." The astral currents disappeared when I
turned in other directions.

"Ah," I exclaimed, "Kashi's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> must be living in the womb of some
mother <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> home is in this lane."

My companions and I approached closer to Serpentine Lane; the
vibrations in my upraised <span class="t13 t23 hoverable">hands</span> grew stronger, more pronounced.
As if by a magnet, I was pulled toward the right <span class="t6 hoverable">side</span> of the road.

Reaching the entrance of a certain house, I was astounded to <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span>
myself transfixed. I knocked at the door in a <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of intense
excitement, holding my very breath. I felt that the successful end
had come for my long, arduous, and certainly unusual quest!

The door was opened by a servant, who told me her <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> was at
home. He descended the stairway from the <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> floor and smiled
at me inquiringly. I hardly knew how to frame my question, at once
pertinent and impertinent.

"Please tell me, sir, if you and your wife have been expecting a
child for about six months?"

"Yes, it is so." Seeing that I was a swami, a renunciate attired
in the traditional orange cloth, he added politely, "Pray inform
me how you know my affairs."

When he <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> about Kashi and the promise I had given, the astonished
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> believed my story.

"A male child of fair complexion will be <span class="t16 t24 hoverable">born</span> to you," I told him.
"He will have a broad face, with a cowlick atop his forehead. His
disposition will be notably spiritual." I felt certain that the
coming child <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> bear these resemblances to Kashi.

Later I visited the child, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> parents had given him his old name
of Kashi. Even in infancy he was strikingly similar in appearance
to my dear Ranchi student. The child showed me an instantaneous
affection; the attraction of the past awoke with redoubled intensity.

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Years</span> later the teen-age boy wrote me, during my stay in America.
He explained his deep longing to follow the path of a renunciate.
I directed him to a Himalayan <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> who, to this day, guides the
reborn Kashi.

{FN28-1} The will, projected from the point between the eyebrows,
is known by yogis as the broadcasting apparatus of thought. When the
feeling is calmly concentrated on the heart, it acts as a mental
radio, and can receive the messages of others from far or near.
In telepathy the fine vibrations of thoughts in one person's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span>
are transmitted through the subtle vibrations of astral ether and
then through the grosser earthly ether, creating electrical waves
which, in turn, translate themselves into <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> waves in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span>
of the other person.

{FN28-2} Every <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> in its pure <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> is omniscient. Kashi's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span>
remembered all the characteristics of Kashi, the boy, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span>
mimicked his hoarse <span class="t23 hoverable">voice</span> in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> to stir my recognition.

CHAPTER: 29

RABINDRANATH TAGORE AND I COMPARE SCHOOLS

"Rabindranath Tagore taught us to sing, as a natural <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of
self-expression, like the birds."

Bhola Nath, a bright fourteen-year-old lad at my Ranchi school,
gave me this explanation after I had complimented him one morning
on his melodious outbursts. With or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> provocation, the boy
poured forth a tuneful stream. He had previously attended the famous
Tagore school of "Santiniketan" (Haven of Peace) at Bolpur.

"The songs of Rabindranath have been on my lips since early youth,"
I told my companion. "All Bengal, even the unlettered peasants,
delights in his lofty verse."

Bhola and I sang <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> a few refrains from Tagore, who has <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span>
to music thousands of Indian poems, some original and others of
hoary antiquity.

"I met Rabindranath soon after he had received the Nobel Prize
for literature," I remarked after our vocalizing. "I was drawn to
visit him because I admired his undiplomatic courage in disposing
of his literary critics." I chuckled.

Bhola curiously inquired the story.

"The scholars severely flayed Tagore for introducing a new style
into Bengali poetry," I began. "He mixed colloquial and classical
expressions, ignoring all the prescribed limitations dear to
the pundits' hearts. His songs embody deep philosophic <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> in
emotionally appealing terms, with little regard for the accepted
literary forms.

"One influential critic slightingly referred to Rabindranath
as a 'pigeon-poet who sold his cooings in print for a rupee.' But
Tagore's revenge was at hand; the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> Western <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> paid homage
at his feet soon after he had translated into English his GITANJALI
('Song Offerings'). A trainload of pundits, including his one-time
critics, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> to Santiniketan to offer their congratulations.

"Rabindranath received his guests only after an intentionally <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span>
delay, and then <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> their praise in stoic silence. Finally he
turned against them their own habitual weapons of criticism.

"'Gentlemen,' he said, 'the fragrant honors you here bestow are
incongruously mingled with the putrid odors of your past contempt.
Is there possibly any connection between my award of the Nobel
Prize, and your suddenly acute powers of appreciation? I am still
the same poet who displeased you when I first offered my humble
flowers at the shrine of Bengal.'

"The newspapers published an <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the bold chastisement given
by Tagore. I admired the outspoken <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> unhypnotized by

by his secretary, Mr. C. F. Andrews, {FN29-1} who was simply attired
in a Bengali DHOTI. He referred lovingly to Tagore as his GURUDEVA.

"Rabindranath received me graciously. He emanated a soothing aura
of charm, culture, and courtliness. Replying to my question about
his literary background, Tagore told me that one ancient source of
his inspiration, besides our religious epics, had been the classical
poet, Bidyapati."

Inspired by these memories, I began to sing Tagore's version of an
old Bengali song, "Light the Lamp of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thy</span> Love." Bhola and I chanted
joyously as we strolled over the VIDYALAYA grounds.

About <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> after founding the Ranchi school, I received an
invitation from Rabindranath to visit him at Santiniketan in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span>

to discuss our educational ideals. I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> gladly. The poet was
seated in his study when I entered; I <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> then, as at our first
meeting, that he was as striking a model of superb manhood as any
painter could desire. His beautifully chiseled face, nobly patrician,
was framed in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> hair and flowing beard. Large, melting eyes; an
angelic smile; and a <span class="t23 hoverable">voice</span> of flutelike quality which was literally
enchanting. Stalwart, tall, and grave, he combined an almost
womanly tenderness with the delightful spontaneity of a child. No
idealized conception of a poet could <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> more suitable embodiment
than in this gentle singer.

Tagore and I were soon deep in a comparative study of our schools,
both founded along unorthodox lines. We discovered many identical
features-outdoor instruction, simplicity, ample scope for the
child's creative spirit. Rabindranath, however, laid considerable
stress on the study of literature and poetry, and the self-expression
through music and song which I had already noted in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of
Bhola. The Santiniketan <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">children</span> observed periods of silence, but
were given no special yoga training.

The poet listened with flattering attention to my description of the
energizing "Yogoda" exercises and the yoga concentration techniques
which are taught to all students at Ranchi.

Tagore told me of his own early educational struggles. "I fled from

school after the fifth grade," he said, laughing. I could readily
understand how his innate poetic delicacy had been affronted by
the dreary, disciplinary atmosphere of a schoolroom.

"That is why I opened Santiniketan under the shady trees and
the glories of the sky." He motioned eloquently to a little group
studying in the beautiful garden. "A child is in his natural setting
amidst the flowers and songbirds. Only <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> may he fully express
the hidden wealth of his individual endowment. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">True</span> education can
never be crammed and pumped from without; rather it must aid in
bringing spontaneously to the surface the infinite hoards of <span class="t12 t20 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">wisdom</span>
within." {FN29-2}

I agreed. "The idealistic and hero-worshiping instincts of the young
are starved on an exclusive diet of statistics and chronological
eras."

The poet spoke lovingly of his father, Devendranath, who had inspired
the Santiniketan beginnings.

"Father presented me with this fertile land, where he had already
built a guest <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> and temple," Rabindranath told me. "I started
my educational experiment here in 1901, with only ten boys. The
eight <span class="t15 t23 hoverable">thousand</span> pounds which came with the Nobel Prize all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> for
the upkeep of the school."

The elder Tagore, Devendranath, known far and wide as "Maharishi,"
was a very remarkable man, as one may discover from his AUTOBIOGRAPHY.
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Two</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> of his manhood were spent in <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> in the Himalayas. In
turn, his father, Dwarkanath Tagore, had been celebrated throughout
Bengal for his munificent public benefactions. From this illustrious
tree has sprung a family of geniuses. Not Rabindranath alone; all
his relatives have distinguished themselves in creative expression.
His brothers, Gogonendra and Abanindra, are among the foremost artists
{FN29-3} of India; another brother, Dwijendra, is a deep-seeing
philosopher, at <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> gentle <span class="t3 t11 t18 t27 hoverable">call</span> the birds and woodland creatures
respond.

Rabindranath invited me to stay overnight in the guest house. It
was indeed a charming spectacle, in the evening, to see the poet
seated with a group in the patio. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Time</span> unfolded backward: the scene
before me was like that of an ancient hermitage-the joyous singer
encircled by his devotees, all aureoled in <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> love. Tagore
knitted each tie with the cords of harmony. Never assertive, he drew
and captured the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> by an irresistible magnetism. Rare blossom
of poesy blooming in the garden of the Lord, attracting others by
a natural fragrance!

In his melodious voice, Rabindranath read to us a few of his exquisite
poems, newly created. Most of his songs and plays, <span class="t0 t11 t24 hoverable">written</span> for the

delectation of his students, have been composed at Santiniketan.
The beauty of his lines, to me, lies in his <span class="t2 t6 t8 t9 t10 t15 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">art</span> of referring to
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> in nearly every stanza, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> seldom mentioning the sacred Name.
"Drunk with the bliss of singing," he wrote, "I forget myself and
<span class="t3 t11 t18 t27 hoverable">call</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thee</span> friend who <span class="t2 t6 t8 t9 t10 t15 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">art</span> my lord."

The following day, after lunch, I bade the poet a reluctant farewell.
I rejoice that his little school has now grown to an international
university, "Viswa-Bharati," where scholars of all lands have found
an ideal setting.

"Where the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> <span class="t28 hoverable">fear</span> and the <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> is held high;

HERMITS. His friend Nicholas Roerich {FN30-1} has summarized the
tale, as follows:

"On an island there lived <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> old hermits. They were so simple that
the only prayer they <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> was: 'We are three; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thou</span> <span class="t2 t6 t8 t9 t10 t15 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">art</span> Three-have

"The local bishop {FN30-2} came to hear about the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> hermits

to teach them the canonical invocations. He arrived on the island,
told the hermits that their heavenly petition was undignified, and
taught them many of the customary prayers. The bishop then <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span>
on a boat. He saw, following the ship, a radiant light. As it
approached, he discerned the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> hermits, who were holding <span class="t13 t23 hoverable">hands</span>

"'We have forgotten the prayers you taught us,' they cried as they
reached the bishop, 'and have hastened to ask you to repeat them.'
The awed bishop shook his head.

"'Dear ones,' he replied humbly, 'continue to live with your old
prayer!'"

Among the trillion mysteries of the cosmos, the most phenomenal
is light. Unlike sound-waves, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> transmission requires air or

interplanetary medium of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> in the undulatory theory, can be
discarded on the Einsteinian grounds that the geometrical properties
of space render the theory of ether unnecessary. Under either
hypothesis, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> remains the most subtle, the freest from material
dependence, of any natural manifestation.

In the gigantic conceptions of Einstein, the velocity of light-186,000
miles per second-dominates the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> Theory of Relativity. He proves

their measurement validity only in reference to the yardstick of

stripped to its rightful nature-a simple essence of ambiguity! With
a few equational strokes of his pen, Einstein has banished from
the cosmos every fixed reality except that of light.

In a later development, his Unified Field Theory, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> physicist
embodies in one mathematical formula the laws of gravitation and
of electromagnetism. Reducing the cosmical structure to variations
on a single law, Einstein {FN30-4} reaches across the ages to the
rishis who proclaimed a sole texture of creation-that of a protean
MAYA.

On the epochal Theory of Relativity have arisen the mathematical
possibilities of exploring the ultimate atom. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Great</span> scientists are

With the recent discovery of the electron microscope came definite
proof of the light-essence of atoms and of the inescapable duality
of nature. THE NEW YORK TIMES gave the following report of a 1937
demonstration of the electron microscope before a meeting of the
American Association for the Advancement of Science:

"The crystalline structure of tungsten, hitherto known only indirectly
by means of X-rays, stood outlined boldly on a fluorescent screen,
showing nine atoms in their correct positions in the space lattice,
a cube, with one atom in each corner and one in the center. The atoms
in the crystal lattice of the tungsten appeared on the fluorescent

screen as points of light, arranged in geometric pattern. Against
this crystal cube of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> the bombarding molecules of air could
be observed as dancing points of light, similar to points
of sunlight shimmering on moving waters. . . .

"The principle of the electron microscope was first discovered in
1927 by Drs. Clinton J. Davisson and Lester H. Germer of the Bell
Telephone Laboratories, New York City, who found that the electron
had a dual personality partaking of the characteristic of both
a particle and a wave. The wave quality gave the electron the
characteristic of light, and a search was begun to devise means for
'focusing' electrons in a manner similar to the focusing of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span>
by means of a lens.

"For his discovery of the Jekyll-Hyde quality of the electron,
which corroborated the prediction made in 1924 by De Broglie, French
Nobel Prize winning physicist, and showed that the entire realm of
<span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> had a dual personality, Dr. Davisson also received
the Nobel Prize in physics."

"The stream of knowledge," Sir James Jeans writes in THE MYSTERIOUS
UNIVERSE, "is heading towards a non-mechanical reality; the universe
begins to look more like a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> than like a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> machine."
Twentieth-century science is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> sounding like a page from the

From science, then, if it must be so, let <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> learn the philosophic

illusion. Its mirages of reality all break down under analysis.
As one by one the reassuring props of a <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> cosmos crash

In his famous equation outlining the equivalence of mass and energy,
Einstein proved that the energy in any particle of <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> is equal
to its mass or weight multiplied by the square of the velocity of
light. The release of the atomic energies is <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> about through
the annihilation of the material particles. The "death" of <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span>
has been the "birth" of an Atomic Age.

Light-velocity is a mathematical standard or constant not because
there is an absolute value in 186,000 miles a second, but because
no material body, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> mass increases with its velocity, can ever

The masters who are able to materialize and dematerialize their

bodies or any other object, and to move with the velocity of light,
and to utilize the creative light-rays in bringing into instant
visibility any <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> manifestation, have fulfilled the necessary
Einsteinian condition: their mass is infinite.

The <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> of a perfected yogi is effortlessly identified,
not with a narrow body, but with the universal structure. Gravitation,
<span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> the "force" of Newton or the Einsteinian "manifestation of
inertia," is powerless to COMPEL a <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> to exhibit the property
of "weight" which is the distinguishing gravitational condition
of all material objects. He who knows himself as the omnipresent

"Optical images," Dr. L. T. Troland of Harvard tells us, "are built

In 1915, shortly after I had entered the Swami Order, I witnessed
a vision of violent contrasts. In it the relativity of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span>
<span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> was vividly established; I clearly perceived the
unity of the <span class="t20 hoverable">Eternal</span> <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Light</span> behind the painful dualities of MAYA.
The vision descended on me as I sat one morning in my little attic
room in Father's Gurpar Road home. For months <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">World</span> War I had been
raging in Europe; I reflected sadly on the vast toll of death.

As I closed my <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> in meditation, my <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> was suddenly
transferred to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> of a captain in command of a battleship.
The thunder of guns split the air as shots were exchanged between

shore batteries and the ship's cannons. A huge shell hit the powder
magazine and tore my ship asunder. I jumped into the water, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span>
with the few sailors who had survived the explosion.

ground.

it as one is conscious of a leg gone to sleep.

"At last the mysterious footstep of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Death</span> has caught up with me,"
I thought. With a final sigh, I was about to sink into unconsciousness
when lo! I found myself seated in the lotus posture in my Gurpar
Road room.

Hysterical tears poured forth as I joyfully stroked and pinched my
regained possession-a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> from any bullet hole in the breast.
I rocked to and fro, inhaling and exhaling to assure myself that
I was alive. Amidst these self-congratulations, again I found my
<span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> transferred to the captain's dead <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> by the gory
shore.

"Lord," I prayed, "am I dead or alive?"

The lifelike images of the motion picture illustrate many truths
concerning creation. The Cosmic Director has <span class="t0 t11 t24 hoverable">written</span> His own plays,
and assembled the tremendous casts for the pageant of the centuries.

From the dark booth of eternity, He pours His creative beam through
the films of successive ages, and the pictures are thrown on the
screen of space. Just as the motion-picture images appear to be real,
but are only combinations of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> and shade, so is the universal
variety a delusive seeming. The planetary spheres, with their
countless forms of life, are naught but figures in a cosmic motion
picture, temporarily <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> to five <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> perceptions as the scenes
are cast on the screen of man's <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> by the infinite
creative beam.

A cinema audience can look up and see that all screen images are
appearing through the instrumentality of one imageless beam of
light. The colorful universal drama is similarly issuing from the
single white <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> of a Cosmic Source. With inconceivable ingenuity
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> is staging an entertainment for His <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> children, making them

European battlefields. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">World</span> War I was still being waged in the
West; the newsreel recorded the carnage with such realism that I
<span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> the theater with a troubled heart.

"Lord," I prayed, "why dost <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thou</span> permit such suffering?"

To my intense surprise, an instant answer came in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of

a vision of the actual European battlefields. The horror of the
struggle, filled with the dead and dying, far surpassed in ferocity
any representation of the newsreel.

"Look intently!" A gentle <span class="t23 hoverable">voice</span> spoke to my inner consciousness. "You
will see that these scenes now being enacted in France are nothing
but a play of chiaroscuro. They are the cosmic motion picture, as
real and as unreal as the theater newsreel you have just seen-a

at it are like an ignorant actor who dies of fright on the stage

are the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">children</span> of light; they will not sleep forever in delusion."

Although I had read scriptural accounts of MAYA, they had not given
me the deep insight that came with the personal visions and their
accompanying <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> of consolation. One's values are profoundly
changed when he is finally convinced that <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span> is only a vast

motion picture, and that not in it, but beyond it, lies his own
reality.

As I finished writing this chapter, I sat on my bed in the lotus
posture. My room was dimly lit by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> shaded lamps. Lifting my gaze,
I noticed that the ceiling was dotted with small mustard-colored
lights, scintillating and quivering with a radiumlike luster.
Myriads of pencilled rays, like sheets of rain, gathered into a
transparent shaft and poured silently <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> me.

At once my <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> lost its grossness and became metamorphosed
into astral texture. I felt a floating sensation as, barely touching
the bed, the weightless <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> shifted slightly and alternately to
<span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> and right. I looked around the room; the furniture and walls
were as usual, but the little mass of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> had so multiplied that
the ceiling was invisible. I was wonder-struck.

"This is the cosmic motion picture mechanism." A <span class="t23 hoverable">voice</span> spoke
as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the light. "Shedding its beam on the white
screen of your bed sheets, it is producing the picture of your
body. Behold, your <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> is nothing but light!"

I gazed at my arms and moved them back and forth, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> could not feel
their weight. An ecstatic joy overwhelmed me. This cosmic stem of
light, blossoming as my body, seemed a <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> replica of the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span>

beams streaming out of the projection booth in a cinema <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> and
manifesting as pictures on the screen.

For a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> I experienced this motion picture of my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> in the
dimly lighted theater of my own bedroom. Despite the many visions
I have had, none was ever more singular. As my illusion of a solid
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> was completely dissipated, and my realization deepened that
the essence of all objects is light, I looked up to the throbbing
stream of lifetrons and spoke entreatingly.

"Divine Light, please withdraw this, my humble bodily picture, into
Thyself, even as Elijah was drawn up to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heaven</span> by a flame."

This prayer was evidently startling; the beam disappeared. My <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span>
resumed its normal weight and sank on the bed; the swarm of dazzling
ceiling lights flickered and vanished. My <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> to leave this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span>
had apparently not arrived.

"Besides," I <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> philosophically, "the prophet Elijah might

CHAPTER: 31

AN INTERVIEW WITH THE SACRED MOTHER

"Reverend Mother, I was baptized in infancy by your prophet-husband.
He was the guru of my parents and of my own guru Sri Yukteswarji.
Will you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> give me the privilege of hearing a few incidents
in your sacred life?"

I was addressing Srimati Kashi Moni, the life-companion of Lahiri
Mahasaya. Finding myself in Benares for a short period, I was
fulfilling a long-felt <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> to visit the venerable lady. She
received me graciously at the old Lahiri homestead in the Garudeswar
Mohulla section of Benares. Although aged, she was blooming like a
lotus, silently emanating a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> fragrance. She was of medium
build, with a slender neck and fair skin. Large, lustrous <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span>
softened her motherly face.

"Son, you are welcome here. Come upstairs."

Kashi Moni led the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> to a very small room where, for a time, she
had lived with her husband. I felt honored to witness the shrine
in which the peerless <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> had condescended to play the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span>
drama of matrimony. The gentle lady motioned me to a pillow seat
by her side.

"It was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> before I came to realize the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> stature of my
husband," she began. "One night, in this very room, I had a vivid
dream. Glorious angels floated in unimaginable grace above me. So
realistic was the sight that I awoke at once; the room was strangely
enveloped in dazzling light.

"My husband, in lotus posture, was levitated in the center of
the room, surrounded by angels who were worshiping him with the
supplicating dignity of palm-folded hands. Astonished beyond measure,
I was convinced that I was still dreaming.

"'Woman,' Lahiri Mahasaya said, 'you are not dreaming. Forsake your
sleep forever and forever.' As he slowly descended to the floor,
I prostrated myself at his feet.

"'Master,' I cried, 'again and again I bow before you! Will you
pardon me for having considered you as my husband? I die with shame
to realize that I have remained asleep in ignorance by the <span class="t6 hoverable">side</span> of
one who is divinely awakened. From this night, you are no longer
my husband, but my guru. Will you accept my insignificant self as
your disciple?' {FN31-1}

"The <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> touched me gently. 'Sacred soul, arise. You are
accepted.' He motioned toward the angels. 'Please bow in turn to
each of these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">holy</span> saints.'

"When I had finished my humble genuflections, the angelic voices
sounded together, like a chorus from an ancient scripture.

"'Consort of the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> One, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thou</span> <span class="t2 t6 t8 t9 t10 t15 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">art</span> blessed. We salute thee.'
They bowed at my feet and lo! their refulgent forms vanished. The
room darkened.

"My guru asked me to receive initiation into KRIYA YOGA.

"'Of course,' I responded. 'I am sorry not to have had its blessing
earlier in my life.'

"'The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> was not ripe.' Lahiri Mahasaya smiled consolingly. 'Much
of your karma I have silently helped you to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> out. Now you are
willing and ready.'

"He touched my forehead. Masses of whirling <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> appeared; the
radiance gradually formed itself into the opal-blue <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> eye,
ringed in gold and centered with a white pentagonal star.

"'Penetrate your <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> through the star into the kingdom
of the Infinite.' My guru's <span class="t23 hoverable">voice</span> had a new note, soft like distant
music.

"Vision after vision broke as oceanic surf on the shores of
my soul. The panoramic spheres finally melted in a sea of bliss.
I lost myself in ever-surging blessedness. When I returned hours
later to awareness of this world, the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> gave me the technique
of KRIYA YOGA.

"From that night on, Lahiri Mahasaya never slept in my room again.
Nor, thereafter, did he ever sleep. He remained in the front room
downstairs, in the company of his disciples both by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> and by
night."

The illustrious lady fell into silence. Realizing the uniqueness
of her relationship with the sublime yogi, I finally ventured to
ask for further reminiscences.

"Son, you are greedy. Nevertheless you shall have one more story."
She smiled shyly. "I will confess a <span class="t0 t9 t11 t14 t17 t28 hoverable">sin</span> which I committed against
my guru-husband. Some months after my initiation, I began to feel
forlorn and neglected. One morning Lahiri Mahasaya entered this
little room to fetch an article; I quickly followed him. Overcome
by violent delusion, I addressed him scathingly.

"'You spend all your <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> with the disciples. What about your
responsibilities for your wife and children? I regret that you do
not interest yourself in providing more money for the family.'

"The <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> glanced at me for a moment, then lo! he was gone. Awed
and frightened, I <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> a <span class="t23 hoverable">voice</span> resounding from every part of the
room:

"'It is all nothing, don't you see? How could a nothing like me
produce riches for you?'

"'Guruji,' I cried, 'I implore pardon a million times! My sinful
<span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> can see you no more; please appear in your sacred form.'

"'I am here.' This reply came from above me. I looked up and saw
the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> materialize in the air, his <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> touching the ceiling.
His <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> were like blinding flames. Beside myself with fear, I lay
sobbing at his feet after he had quietly descended to the floor.

"'Woman,' he said, 'seek <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> wealth, not the paltry tinsel of
earth. After acquiring inward treasure, you will <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> that outward
supply is always forthcoming.' He added, 'One of my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t13 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">sons</span>
will make provision for you.'

"My guru's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> naturally came true; a disciple did leave a
considerable sum for our family."

I thanked Kashi Moni for sharing with me her wondrous experiences.

{FN31-2} On the following <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> I returned to her home and enjoyed
several hours of philosophical discussion with Tincouri and Ducouri
Lahiri. These <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> saintly <span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t13 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">sons</span> of India's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> yogi followed
closely in his ideal footsteps. Both <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> were fair, tall, stalwart,
and heavily bearded, with soft voices and an old-fashioned charm
of manner.

His wife was not the only woman disciple of Lahiri Mahasaya; there
were hundreds of others, including my mother. A woman chela once
asked the guru for his photograph. He handed her a print, remarking,
"If you deem it a protection, then it is so; otherwise it is only
a picture."

A few <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">days</span> later this woman and Lahiri Mahasaya's daughter-in-law
happened to be studying the BHAGAVAD GITA at a table behind which
hung the guru's photograph. An electrical storm broke out with
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> fury.

"Lahiri Mahasaya, protect us!" The women bowed before the picture.
Lightning struck the <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">book</span> which they had been reading, but the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span>
devotees were unhurt.

"I felt as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> a sheet of ice had been placed around me to ward
off the scorching heat," the chela explained.

Lahiri Mahasaya performed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> miracles in connection with a woman
disciple, Abhoya. She and her husband, a Calcutta lawyer, started
one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> for Benares to visit the guru. Their carriage was delayed
by heavy traffic; they reached the Howrah main station only to hear
the Benares train whistling for departure.

Abhoya, near the ticket office, stood quietly.

"Lahiri Mahasaya, I beseech <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thee</span> to stop the train!" she silently
prayed. "I cannot suffer the pangs of delay in waiting another <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span>
to see thee."

The wheels of the snorting train continued to move round and
round, but there was no onward progress. The engineer and passengers
descended to the platform to <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> the phenomenon. An English
railroad guard approached Abhoya and her husband. Contrary to all
precedent, he volunteered his services.

"Babu," he said, "give me the money. I will buy your tickets while
you get aboard."

As soon as the couple was seated and had received the tickets, the
train slowly moved forward. In panic, the engineer and passengers
clambered again to their places, knowing neither how the train
started, nor why it had stopped in the first place.

Arriving at the home of Lahiri Mahasaya in Benares, Abhoya silently
prostrated herself before the master, and tried to touch his feet.

"Compose yourself, Abhoya," he remarked. "How you <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t8 t13 t15 t17 t18 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> to bother
me! As if you could not have come here by the next train!"

Abhoya visited Lahiri Mahasaya on another memorable occasion. This
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> she wanted his intercession, not with a train, but with the
stork.

"I pray you to bless me that my ninth child may live," she said.
"Eight babies have been <span class="t16 t24 hoverable">born</span> to me; all died soon after birth."

The <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> smiled sympathetically. "Your coming child will live.
Please follow my instructions carefully. The baby, a girl, will be
<span class="t16 t24 hoverable">born</span> at night. See that the oil lamp is kept burning until dawn.
Do not fall asleep and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> allow the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> to become extinguished."

Abhoya's child was a daughter, <span class="t16 t24 hoverable">born</span> at night, exactly as foreseen
by the omniscient guru. The mother instructed her nurse to keep
the lamp filled with oil. Both women kept the urgent vigil far into
the early morning hours, but finally fell asleep. The lamp oil was
almost gone; the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> flickered feebly.

The bedroom door unlatched and flew open with a violent sound.
The startled women awoke. Their astonished <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> beheld the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of
Lahiri Mahasaya.

"Abhoya, behold, the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> is almost gone!" He pointed to the lamp,
which the nurse hastened to refill. As soon as it burned again
brightly, the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> vanished. The door closed; the latch was
affixed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> visible agency.

Abhoya's ninth child survived; in 1935, when I made inquiry, she
was still living.

One of Lahiri Mahasaya's disciples, the venerable Kali Kumar Roy,
related to me many fascinating details of his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> with the master.

"I was often a guest at his Benares home for weeks at a time,"
Roy told me. "I observed that many saintly figures, DANDA {FN31-3}
swamis, arrived in the quiet of night to sit at the guru's feet.
Sometimes they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> engage in discussion of meditational and
philosophical points. At dawn the exalted guests <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> depart. I
found during my visits that Lahiri Mahasaya did not once lie down
to sleep.

"During an early period of my association with the master, I had
to contend with the opposition of my employer," Roy <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> on. "He

was steeped in materialism.

"'I don't want religious fanatics on my staff,' he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> sneer.
'If I ever meet your charlatan guru, I shall give him some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span>
to remember.'

"This alarming threat failed to interrupt my regular program; I spent
nearly every evening in my guru's presence. One night my employer
followed me and rushed rudely into the parlor. He was doubtless
fully bent on uttering the pulverizing remarks he had promised. No
sooner had the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> seated himself than Lahiri Mahasaya addressed
the little group of about twelve disciples.

"'Would you all like to see a picture?'

"When we nodded, he asked us to darken the room. 'Sit behind one
another in a circle,' he said, 'and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> your <span class="t13 t23 hoverable">hands</span> over the <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span>
of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> in front of you.'

"I was not surprised to see that my employer also was following,
albeit unwillingly, the master's directions. In a few minutes Lahiri
Mahasaya asked us what we were seeing.

"'Sir,' I replied, 'a beautiful woman appears. She wears a
red-bordered SARI, and stands near an elephant-ear plant.' All the

other disciples gave the same description. The <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> turned to my
employer. 'Do you recognize that woman?'

"'Yes.' The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> was evidently struggling with emotions new to his
nature. 'I have been foolishly spending my money on her, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span>

I am ashamed of the motives which <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> me
here. Will you forgive me, and receive me as a disciple?'

"'If you lead a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> moral <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> for six months, I shall accept
you.' The <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> enigmatically added, 'Otherwise I won't have to
initiate you.'

"For <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> months my employer refrained from temptation; then he
resumed his former relationship with the woman. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Two</span> months later
he died. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> I came to understand my guru's veiled prophecy about

Lahiri Mahasaya had a very famous friend, Swami Trailanga, who was
reputed to be over <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> hundred <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> old.

sat <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> in meditation. Trailanga's fame is so widespread that

streets of New York, displaying his <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> powers, it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> cause
the same excitement that was <span class="t16 hoverable">created</span> by Trailanga decades ago as
he passed through the crowded lanes of Benares.

On many occasions the swami was seen to drink, with no ill effect,
the most deadly poisons. Thousands of people, including a few who
are still living, have seen Trailanga floating on the Ganges. For
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">days</span> <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> sit on top of the water, or remain hidden

bathing GHATS was the swami's motionless <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> on the blistering

The yogi was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> not only spiritually, but physically. His weight

As he ate very seldom, the mystery is increased. A master, however,
easily ignores all usual rules of health, when he desires to do so
for some special reason, often a subtle one known only to himself.

Trailanga always remained completely nude. The harassed police of
Benares came to regard him as a baffling problem child. The natural
swami, like the early Adam in the garden of Eden, was utterly
unconscious of his nakedness. The police were quite conscious of
it, however, and unceremoniously committed him to jail. General
embarrassment ensued; the enormous <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> of Trailanga was soon seen,
in its usual entirety, on the prison roof. His cell, still securely
locked, offered no clue to his mode of escape.

The discouraged officers of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">law</span> once more performed their duty.
This <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> a guard was posted before the swami's cell. Might again
retired before right. Trailanga was soon observed in his nonchalant
stroll over the roof. Justice is blind; the outwitted police decided
to follow her example.

The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> yogi preserved a habitual silence. {FN31-4} In spite of
his round face and huge, barrel-like stomach, Trailanga ate only
occasionally. After weeks <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> food, he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> break his fast
with potfuls of clabbered milk offered to him by devotees. A skeptic
once determined to expose Trailanga as a charlatan. A large bucket
of calcium-lime mixture, <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> in whitewashing walls, was placed
before the swami.

"Master," the materialist said, in mock reverence, "I have <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span>

you some clabbered milk. Please drink it."

Trailanga unhesitatingly drained, to the last drop, the containerful
of burning lime. In a few minutes the evildoer fell to the ground
in agony.

"Help, swami, help!" he cried. "I am on fire! Forgive my wicked
test!"

The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> yogi broke his habitual silence. "Scoffer," he said,
"you did not realize when you offered me poison that my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> is

me.

play tricks on anyone."

The well-purged sinner, healed by Trailanga's words, slunk feebly
away.

The reversal of pain was not due to any volition of the master,
but came about through unerring application of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">law</span> of justice

they have banished forever all thwarting crosscurrents of ego.

The automatic adjustments of righteousness, often paid in an unexpected
coin as in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of Trailanga and his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be murderer, assuage

viewpoint, aweless before the cosmic spectacle, arouses a train of

occasion of his triumphant entry into Jerusalem. As the disciples
and the multitude shouted for joy, and cried, "Peace in heaven, and
<span class="t0 t7 t21 t27 hoverable">glory</span> in the highest," certain Pharisees complained of the undignified
spectacle. "Master," they protested, "rebuke <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thy</span> disciples."

"I tell you," <span class="t0 t6 t8 t9 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t22 t23 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Jesus</span> replied, "that, if these should hold their

Mai Jiew. Daughter of one of Trailanga's disciples, she received
the swami's training from her early childhood. She lived for
forty <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> in a series of lonely Himalayan caves near Badrinath,
Kedarnath, Amarnath, and Pasupatinath. The BRAHMACHARINI (woman
ascetic), <span class="t16 t24 hoverable">born</span> in 1826, is now <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> over the century mark. Not aged
in appearance, however, she has retained her black hair, sparkling
teeth, and amazing energy. She comes out of her seclusion every

few <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> to attend the periodical MELAS or religious fairs.

This woman saint often visited Lahiri Mahasaya. She has related
that one day, in the Barackpur section near Calcutta, while she was
sitting by Lahiri Mahasaya's side, his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> guru Babaji quietly
entered the room and held converse with them both.

On one occasion her <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> Trailanga, forsaking his usual silence,
honored Lahiri Mahasaya very pointedly in public. A Benares disciple
objected.

"Sir," he said, "why do you, a swami and a renunciate, show such
respect to a householder?"

"My son," Trailanga replied, "Lahiri Mahasaya is like a <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span>
kitten, remaining wherever the Cosmic Mother has placed him.
While dutifully playing the part of a worldly man, he has received
that perfect self-realization for which I have renounced even my
loincloth!"

{FN31-1} One is reminded here of Milton's line: "He for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> only,

RAMA IS RAISED FROM THE DEAD

"Now a certain <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> was sick, named Lazarus. . . .

Sri Yukteswar was expounding the Christian scriptures one sunny
morning on the balcony of his Serampore hermitage. Besides a few
of Master's other disciples, I was present with a small group of
my Ranchi students.

"In this <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> <span class="t0 t6 t8 t9 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t22 t23 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Jesus</span> calls himself the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Son</span> of God. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Though</span> he was
truly united with God, his reference here has a deep impersonal
significance," my guru explained. "The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Son</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> is the <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Christ</span> or

an Abstraction that he does not know. The 'glory' or nimbus around
the <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> of the saints is a symbolic witness of their CAPACITY to
render <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> homage."

Sri Yukteswar <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> on to read the marvelous story of Lazarus'
resurrection. At its conclusion <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> fell into a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> silence,
the sacred <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">book</span> open on his knee.

"I too was privileged to <span class="t0 t6 t7 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t17 t20 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">behold</span> a similar miracle." My guru finally
spoke with solemn unction. "Lahiri Mahasaya resurrected one of my
friends from the dead."

The young lads at my <span class="t6 hoverable">side</span> smiled with keen interest. There was
enough of the boy in me, too, to enjoy not only the philosophy
but, in particular, any story I could get Sri Yukteswar to relate
about his wondrous experiences with his guru.

"My friend Rama and I were inseparable," <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> began. "Because he
was shy and reclusive, he chose to visit our guru Lahiri Mahasaya
only during the hours of midnight and dawn, when the crowd of
daytime disciples was absent. As Rama's closest friend, I served as
a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> vent through which he let out the wealth of his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span>
perceptions. I found inspiration in his ideal companionship." My
guru's face softened with memories.

"Rama was suddenly put to a severe test," Sri Yukteswar continued.
"He contracted the disease of Asiatic cholera. As our <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> never
objected to the services of physicians at times of serious illness,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> specialists were summoned. Amidst the frantic rush of ministering
to the stricken man, I was deeply praying to Lahiri Mahasaya for
help. I hurried to his home and sobbed out the story.

"'The doctors are seeing Rama. He will be well.' My guru smiled
jovially.

"I returned with a <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> to my friend's bedside, only to <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span>

him in a dying state.

"'He cannot last more than one or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> hours,' one of the physicians
told me with a gesture of despair. Once more I hastened to Lahiri
Mahasaya.

"'The doctors are conscientious men. I am sure Rama will be well.'
The <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> dismissed me blithely.

"At Rama's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> I found both doctors gone. One had <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> me a note:
'We have done our best, but his <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> is hopeless.'

"My friend was indeed the picture of a dying man. I did not understand
how Lahiri Mahasaya's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> could fail to come true, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> the sight
of Rama's rapidly ebbing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> kept suggesting to my mind: 'All is
over now.' Tossing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> on the seas of <span class="t4 t7 t12 t16 hoverable">faith</span> and apprehensive doubt,
I ministered to my friend as best I could. He roused himself to
cry out:

"'Yukteswar, run to <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> and tell him I am gone. Ask him to
bless my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> before its last rites.' With these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> Rama sighed
heavily and gave up the ghost. {FN32-2}

"I wept for an hour by his beloved form. Always a lover of quiet,
now he had attained the utter stillness of death. Another disciple

came in; I asked him to remain in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> until I returned.
Half-dazed, I trudged back to my guru.

"'How is Rama now?' Lahiri Mahasaya's face was wreathed in smiles.

"'Sir, you will soon see how he is,' I blurted out emotionally.
'In a few hours you will see his body, before it is carried to the
crematory grounds.' I broke down and moaned openly.

"'Yukteswar, control yourself. Sit calmly and meditate.' My guru
retired into SAMADHI. The afternoon and night passed in unbroken
silence; I struggled unsuccessfully to regain an inner composure.

"At dawn Lahiri Mahasaya glanced at me consolingly. 'I see you are
still disturbed. Why didn't you explain yesterday that you expected
me to give Rama tangible aid in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of some medicine?' The
<span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> pointed to a cup-shaped lamp containing crude castor oil.
'Fill a little bottle from the lamp; put seven drops into Rama's
mouth.'

"'Sir,' I remonstrated, 'he has been dead since yesterday noon. Of
what <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> is the oil now?'

"'Never mind; just do as I ask.' Lahiri Mahasaya's cheerful
mood was incomprehensible; I was still in the unassuaged agony of

bereavement. Pouring out a small amount of oil, I departed for
Rama's house.

"I found my friend's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> rigid in the death-clasp. Paying no
attention to his ghastly condition, I opened his lips with my right
finger and managed, with my <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> and the help of the cork, to
put the oil drop by drop over his clenched teeth.

"As the seventh drop touched his cold lips, Rama shivered violently.
His muscles vibrated from <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> to foot as he sat up wonderingly.

"'I saw Lahiri Mahasaya in a blaze of light,' he cried. 'He shone
like the sun. 'Arise; forsake your sleep,' he commanded me. 'Come
with Yukteswar to see me.'"

"I could scarcely believe my <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> when Rama dressed himself and
was strong enough after that fatal sickness to walk to the home of
our guru. There he prostrated himself before Lahiri Mahasaya with
tears of gratitude.

"The <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> was beside himself with mirth. His <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> twinkled at me
mischievously.

"'Yukteswar,' he said, 'surely henceforth you will not fail to
carry with you a bottle of castor oil! Whenever you see a corpse,

just administer the oil! Why, seven drops of lamp oil must surely
foil the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of Yama!' {FN32-3}

"'Guruji, you are ridiculing me. I don't understand; please point
out the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of my error.'

"'I told you twice that Rama <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be well; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> you could not fully
believe me,' Lahiri Mahasaya explained. 'I did not mean the doctors
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be able to cure him; I remarked only that they were in
attendance. There was no causal connection between my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> statements.
I didn't want to interfere with the physicians; they have to live,
too.' In a <span class="t23 hoverable">voice</span> resounding with joy, my guru added, 'Always know
that the inexhaustible Paramatman {FN32-4} can heal anyone, doctor
or no doctor.'

"'I see my mistake,' I acknowledged remorsefully. 'I know now that
your simple <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> is binding on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> cosmos.'"

As Sri Yukteswar finished the awesome story, one of the spellbound
listeners ventured a question that, from a child, was doubly
understandable.

"Sir," he said, "why did your guru <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> castor oil?"

"Child, giving the oil had no <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> except that I expected

Rama to die, because I had partially doubted. But the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> guru

Sri Yukteswar dismissed the little group, and motioned me to a
blanket seat at his feet.

"Yogananda," he said with unusual gravity, "you have been surrounded
from birth by direct disciples of Lahiri Mahasaya. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>

refused to permit his followers to build any organization around
his teachings. He made, nevertheless, a significant prediction.

SHYAMA CHARAN LAHIRI MAHASAYA, appeared in 1941. It was <span class="t0 t11 t24 hoverable">written</span>
by my disciple, Swami Satyananda, who for many <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> has been the

translated a few passages from his <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">book</span> and have incorporated them
into this section devoted to Lahiri Mahasaya.

It was into a pious Brahmin family of ancient lineage that Lahiri
Mahasaya was <span class="t16 t24 hoverable">born</span> September 30, 1828. His birthplace was the village
of Ghurni in the Nadia district near Krishnagar, Bengal. He was the
youngest <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> of Muktakashi, the <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> wife of the esteemed Gaur
Mohan Lahiri. (His first wife, after the birth of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> sons, had
died during a pilgrimage.) The boy's mother passed away during

his childhood; little about her is known except the revealing <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span>
that she was an ardent devotee of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> Shiva, {FN32-7} scripturally
designated as the "King of Yogis."

The boy Lahiri, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> given name was Shyama Charan, spent his early
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> in the ancestral home at Nadia. At the age of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> or four
he was often observed sitting under the sands in the posture of a
yogi, his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> completely hidden except for the head.

The Lahiri estate was destroyed in the winter of 1833, when
the nearby Jalangi River changed its course and disappeared into
the depths of the Ganges. One of the Shiva temples founded by the
Lahiris <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> into the river along with the family home. A devotee
rescued the stone image of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> Shiva from the swirling waters and
placed it in a new temple, now well-known as the Ghurni Shiva Site.

Gaur Mohan Lahiri and his family <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> Nadia and became residents
of Benares, where the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">father</span> immediately erected a Shiva temple. He
conducted his household along the lines of Vedic discipline, with
regular observance of ceremonial worship, acts of charity, and
scriptural study. Just and open-minded, however, he did not ignore
the beneficial current of modern ideas.

The boy Lahiri <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> lessons in Hindi and Urdu in Benares study-groups.
He attended a school conducted by Joy Narayan Ghosal, receiving

instruction in Sanskrit, Bengali, French, and English. Applying
himself to a close study of the VEDAS, the young yogi listened
eagerly to scriptural discussions by learned Brahmins, including
a Marhatta pundit named Nag-Bhatta.

Shyama Charan was a kind, gentle, and courageous youth, beloved by
all his companions. With a well-proportioned, bright, and powerful
body, he excelled in swimming and in many skillful activities.

In 1846 Shyama Charan Lahiri was married to Srimati Kashi Moni,
daughter of Sri Debnarayan Sanyal. A model Indian housewife, Kashi
Moni cheerfully carried on her home duties and the traditional
householder's obligation to serve guests and the poor. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Two</span> saintly
sons, Tincouri and Ducouri, <span class="t11 hoverable">blessed</span> the union.

At the age of 23, in 1851, Lahiri Mahasaya <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> the post of accountant
in the Military Engineering Department of the English government.
He received many promotions during the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of his service. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span>
not only was he a <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> before God's eyes, but also a success in
the little <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> drama where he played his given role as an office
worker in the world.

As the offices of the Army Department were shifted, Lahiri Mahasaya
was transferred to Gazipur, Mirjapur, Danapur, Naini Tal, Benares,
and other localities. After the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">death</span> of his father, Lahiri had to

assume the entire responsibility of his family, for whom he bought
a quiet residence in the Garudeswar Mohulla neighborhood of Benares.

of the purpose for which he had been reincarnated on earth.

CHAPTER: 33

BABAJI, THE YOGI-CHRIST OF MODERN INDIA

The northern Himalayan crags near Badrinarayan are still <span class="t11 hoverable">blessed</span> by
the living presence of Babaji, guru of Lahiri Mahasaya. The secluded

master has retained his <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> for centuries, perhaps for
millenniums. The deathless Babaji is an AVATARA. This Sanskrit <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span>
means "descent"; its roots are AVA, "down," and TRI, "to pass."
In the Hindu scriptures, AVATARA signifies the descent of Divinity
into flesh.

"Babaji's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> is beyond <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> comprehension," Sri
Yukteswar explained to me. "The dwarfed vision of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> cannot pierce
to his transcendental star. One attempts in vain even to picture
the avatar's attainment. It is inconceivable."

The UPANISHADS have minutely classified every stage of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span>
advancement. A SIDDHA ("perfected being") has progressed from the
<span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of a JIVANMUKTA ("freed while living") to that of a PARAMUKTA
("supremely free"-full <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> over death); the latter has completely
escaped from the mayic thralldom and its reincarnational round. The
PARAMUKTA <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> seldom returns to a <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> body; if he does,
he is an avatar, a divinely appointed medium of supernal blessings
on the world.

An avatar is unsubject to the universal economy; his pure body,
visible as a <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> image, is <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> from any debt to nature. The
casual gaze may see nothing extraordinary in an avatar's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> but
it casts no shadow nor makes any footprint on the ground. These are
outward symbolic proofs of an inward lack of darkness and material

bondage. Such a God-man alone knows the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Truth</span> behind the relativities
of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> and death. Omar Khayyam, so grossly misunderstood, sang of
this liberated <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> in his immortal scripture, the RUBAIYAT:

"Ah, Moon of my Delight who know'st no wane,
The Moon of Heav'n is rising once again;
How oft hereafter rising shall she look
Through this same Garden after me-in vain!"

The "Moon of Delight" is God, <span class="t20 hoverable">eternal</span> Polaris, anachronous never.
The "Moon of Heav'n" is the outward cosmos, fettered to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">law</span> of
periodic recurrence. Its chains had been dissolved forever by the
Persian seer through his self-realization. "How oft hereafter rising
shall she look . . . after me-in vain!" What frustration of search
by a frantic universe for an absolute omission!

<span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Christ</span> expressed his freedom in another way: "And a certain scribe

Spacious with omnipresence, could <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Christ</span> indeed be followed except
in the overarching Spirit?

Krishna, Rama, Buddha, and Patanjali were among the ancient Indian
avatars. A considerable poetic literature in Tamil has grown
up around Agastya, a South Indian avatar. He worked many miracles
during the centuries preceding and following the Christian era,
and is credited with retaining his <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> even to this day.

Babaji's mission in India has been to assist prophets in carrying
out their special dispensations. He <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> qualifies for the scriptural
classification of MAHAVATAR (Great Avatar). He has stated that
he gave yoga initiation to Shankara, ancient founder of the Swami
Order, and to Kabir, famous medieval saint. His chief nineteenth-century
disciple was, as we know, Lahiri Mahasaya, revivalist of the lost
KRIYA art.

to inspire the nations to forsake suicidal wars, race hatreds,
religious sectarianism, and the boomerang-evils of materialism.
Babaji is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> aware of the trend of modern times, especially of

the influence and complexities of Western civilization, and realizes
the necessity of spreading the self-liberations of yoga equally in
the West and in the East.

That there is no historical reference to Babaji need not surprise
us. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> guru has never openly appeared in any century; the
misinterpreting glare of publicity has no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> in his millennial
plans. Like the Creator, the sole but silent Power, Babaji <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span>
in a humble obscurity.

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Great</span> prophets like <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Christ</span> and Krishna come to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> for a specific
and spectacular purpose; they depart as soon as it is accomplished.
Other avatars, like Babaji, undertake <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> which is concerned more
with the slow evolutionary progress of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> during the centuries
than with any one outstanding event of history. Such masters always
veil themselves from the gross public gaze, and have the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span>
to become invisible at will. For these reasons, and because they
generally instruct their disciples to maintain silence about them, a
<span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> of towering <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> figures remain world-unknown. I give
in these pages on Babaji merely a hint of his life-only a few facts
which he deems it fit and helpful to be publicly imparted.

No limiting facts about Babaji's family or birthplace, dear to the
annalist's heart, have ever been discovered. His speech is generally
in Hindi, but he converses easily in any language. He has adopted

the simple name of Babaji (revered father); other titles of respect
given him by Lahiri Mahasaya's disciples are Mahamuni Babaji Maharaj
(supreme ecstatic saint), Maha Yogi (greatest of yogis), Trambak
Baba and Shiva Baba (titles of avatars of Shiva). Does it <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span>
that we know not the patronymic of an earth-released master?

"Whenever anyone utters with reverence the name of Babaji," Lahiri
Mahasaya said, "that devotee attracts an instant <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> blessing."

The deathless guru bears no marks of age on his body; he appears to
be no more than a youth of twenty-five. Fair-skinned, of medium build
and height, Babaji's beautiful, strong <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> radiates a perceptible
glow. His <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> are dark, calm, and tender; his long, lustrous
hair is copper-colored. A very strange <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> is that Babaji bears an
extraordinarily exact resemblance to his disciple Lahiri Mahasaya.
The similarity is so striking that, in his later years, Lahiri
Mahasaya might have passed as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">father</span> of the youthful-looking
Babaji.

Babaji in the Himalayas.

"The peerless <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> moves with his group from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> in

His <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> are the signal for moving with his group instantaneously
to another place. He does not always employ this method of astral
travel; sometimes he goes on foot from peak to peak.

"Babaji can be seen or recognized by others only when he so
desires. He is known to have appeared in many slightly different
forms to various devotees-sometimes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> beard and moustache,
and sometimes with them. As his undecaying <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> requires no food,
the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> seldom eats. As a social courtesy to visiting disciples,
he occasionally accepts fruits, or rice cooked in milk and clarified
butter.

"Two amazing incidents of Babaji's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> are known to me," Kebalananda
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> on. "His disciples were sitting one night around a huge <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span>
which was blazing for a sacred Vedic ceremony. The <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> suddenly
seized a burning log and lightly struck the bare shoulder of a
chela who was close to the fire.

"'Sir, how cruel!' Lahiri Mahasaya, who was present, made this
remonstrance.

"'Would you rather have seen him burned to ashes before your eyes,
according to the decree of his past karma?'

"With these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> Babaji placed his healing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> on the chela's
disfigured shoulder. 'I have freed you tonight from painful death.
The karmic <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">law</span> has been satisfied through your slight suffering by
fire.'

"On another occasion Babaji's sacred circle was disturbed by the
arrival of a stranger. He had climbed with astonishing skill to
the nearly inaccessible ledge near the camp of the master.

"'Sir, you must be the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Babaji.' The man's face was lit with
inexpressible reverence. 'For months I have pursued a ceaseless
search for you among these forbidding crags. I implore you to accept
me as a disciple.'

"When the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> guru made no response, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> pointed to the rocky
chasm at his feet.

"'If you refuse me, I will jump from this mountain. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Life</span> has no
further value if I cannot win your guidance to the Divine.'

"'Jump then,' Babaji said unemotionally. 'I cannot accept you in
your present <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of development.'

"The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> immediately hurled himself over the cliff. Babaji instructed

the shocked disciples to fetch the stranger's body. When they
returned with the mangled form, the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> placed his <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span>
on the dead man. Lo! he opened his <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> and prostrated himself
humbly before the omnipotent one.

"'You are now ready for discipleship.' Babaji beamed lovingly on
his resurrected chela. 'You have courageously passed a difficult
test. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Death</span> shall not touch you again; now you are one of our
immortal flock.' Then he spoke his usual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> of departure, 'DERA
DANDA UTHAO'; the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> group vanished from the mountain."

An avatar lives in the omnipresent Spirit; for him there is no
distance inverse to the square. Only one reason, therefore, can
motivate Babaji in maintaining his <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> from century to
century: the <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> to furnish humanity with a concrete example
of its own possibilities. Were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> never vouchsafed a glimpse of
Divinity in the flesh, he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> remain oppressed by the heavy mayic
delusion that he cannot transcend his mortality.

<span class="t0 t6 t8 t9 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t22 t23 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Jesus</span> knew from the beginning the sequence of his life; he passed
through each event not for himself, not from any karmic compulsion,
but solely for the upliftment of reflective <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> beings. His
four reporter-disciples-Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John-recorded the
ineffable drama for the benefit of later generations.

For Babaji, also, there is no relativity of past, present, future;
from the beginning he has known all phases of his life. Yet,
accommodating himself to the limited understanding of men, he has
played many acts of his <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> in the presence of one or more
witnesses. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> it came about that a disciple of Lahiri Mahasaya was
present when Babaji deemed the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> to be ripe for him to proclaim
the possibility of bodily immortality. He uttered this promise
before Ram Gopal Muzumdar, that it might finally become known for
the inspiration of other seeking hearts. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> ones <span class="t9 t11 t20 t21 t22 t23 t27 hoverable">speak</span> their

solely for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> of man, even as <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Christ</span> said: "Father . . .

{FN33-2} During my visit at Ranbajpur with Ram Gopal, "the sleepless
saint," {FN33-3} he related the wondrous story of his first meeting
with Babaji.

"I sometimes <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> my isolated cave to sit at Lahiri Mahasaya's feet
in Benares," Ram Gopal told me. "One midnight as I was silently
meditating in a group of his disciples, the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> made a surprising
request.

"'Ram Gopal,' he said, 'go at once to the Dasasamedh bathing GHAT.'

"I soon reached the secluded spot. The night was bright with moonlight

and the glittering stars. After I had sat in patient silence for
awhile, my attention was drawn to a huge stone slab near my feet.
It rose gradually, revealing an underground cave. As the stone
remained balanced in some unknown manner, the draped <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of
a young and surpassingly lovely woman was levitated from the cave
<span class="t23 hoverable">high</span> into the air. Surrounded by a soft halo, she slowly descended
in front of me and stood motionless, steeped in an inner <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of
ecstasy. She finally stirred, and spoke gently.

"'I am Mataji, {FN33-4} the sister of Babaji. I have asked him and
also Lahiri Mahasaya to come to my cave tonight to discuss a <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span>
of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> importance.'

"A nebulous <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> was rapidly floating over the Ganges; the strange
luminescence was reflected in the opaque waters. It approached
nearer and nearer until, with a blinding flash, it appeared by the
<span class="t6 hoverable">side</span> of Mataji and condensed itself instantly into the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span>
of Lahiri Mahasaya. He bowed humbly at the feet of the woman saint.

"Before I had recovered from my bewilderment, I was further
wonderstruck to <span class="t0 t6 t7 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t17 t20 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">behold</span> a circling mass of mystical <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> traveling
in the sky. Descending swiftly, the flaming whirlpool neared our
group and materialized itself into the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> of a beautiful youth who,
I understood at once, was Babaji. He looked like Lahiri Mahasaya,
the only difference being that Babaji appeared much younger, and

had long, bright hair.

"Lahiri Mahasaya, Mataji, and myself knelt at the guru's feet. An
ethereal sensation of beatific <span class="t0 t7 t21 t27 hoverable">glory</span> thrilled every fiber of my
being as I touched his <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> flesh.

"'Blessed sister,' Babaji said, 'I am intending to shed my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span>
and plunge into the Infinite Current.'

"'I have already glimpsed your plan, beloved master. I wanted to
discuss it with you tonight. Why should you leave your body?' The
glorious woman looked at him beseechingly.

"'What is the difference if I wear a visible or invisible wave on
the ocean of my Spirit?'

"Mataji replied with a quaint flash of wit. 'Deathless guru, if it
makes no difference, then please do not ever relinquish your form.'
{FN33-5}

"'Be it so,' Babaji said solemnly. 'I will never leave my <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span>
body. It will always remain visible to at least a small <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> of
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> on this earth. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> has spoken His own wish through your
lips.'

"As I listened in awe to the conversation between these exalted
beings, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> guru turned to me with a benign gesture.

"'Fear not, Ram Gopal,' he said, 'you are <span class="t11 hoverable">blessed</span> to be a witness
at the scene of this immortal promise.'

"As the sweet melody of Babaji's <span class="t23 hoverable">voice</span> faded away, his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> and
that of Lahiri Mahasaya slowly levitated and moved backward over
the Ganges. An aureole of dazzling <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> templed their bodies as
they vanished into the night sky. Mataji's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> floated to the cave
and descended; the stone slab closed of itself, as if working on
an invisible leverage.

"Infinitely inspired, I wended my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> back to Lahiri Mahasaya's
place. As I bowed before him in the early dawn, my guru smiled at
me understandingly.

"'I am happy for you, Ram Gopal,' he said. 'The <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> of meeting
Babaji and Mataji, which you have often expressed to me, has found
at last a sacred fulfillment.'

"My fellow disciples informed me that Lahiri Mahasaya had not moved
from his dais since early the preceding evening.

"'He gave a wonderful discourse on immortality after you had <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span>

for the Dasasamedh GHAT,' one of the chelas told me. For the first

"Lahiri Mahasaya later explained to me many metaphysical points
concerning the hidden <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> plan for this earth," Ram Gopal
concluded. "Babaji has been chosen by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> to remain in his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span>

CHAPTER: 34

MATERIALIZING A PALACE IN THE HIMALAYAS

"Babaji's first meeting with Lahiri Mahasaya is an enthralling
story, and one of the few which gives us a detailed glimpse of the
deathless guru."

These <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> were Swami Kebalananda's preamble to a wondrous tale.
The first <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> he recounted it I was literally spellbound. On many
other occasions I coaxed my gentle Sanskrit tutor to repeat the
story, which was later told me in substantially the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> by
Sri Yukteswar. Both these Lahiri Mahasaya disciples had <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> the
awesome tale direct from the lips of their guru.

"My first meeting with Babaji <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> in my thirty-third year,"
Lahiri Mahasaya had said. "In the autumn of 1861 I was stationed
in Danapur as a government accountant in the Military Engineering
Department. One morning the office manager summoned me.

"'Lahiri,' he said, 'a telegram has just come from our main office.
You are to be transferred to Ranikhet, where an army post {FN34-1}
is now being established.'

"With one servant, I <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> out on the 500-mile trip. Traveling by
horse and buggy, we arrived in thirty <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">days</span> at the Himalayan site
of Ranikhet. {FN34-2}

"My office duties were not onerous; I was able to spend many hours
roaming in the magnificent hills. A rumor reached me that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> saints
<span class="t11 hoverable">blessed</span> the region with their presence; I felt a strong <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> to
see them. During a ramble one early afternoon, I was astounded to
hear a distant <span class="t23 hoverable">voice</span> calling my name. I continued my vigorous upward
climb on Drongiri Mountain. A slight uneasiness beset me at the
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> that I might not be able to retrace my steps before darkness
had descended over the jungle.

"I finally reached a small clearing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> sides were dotted
with caves. On one of the rocky ledges stood a smiling young man,

extending his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> in welcome. I noticed with astonishment that,
except for his copper-colored hair, he bore a remarkable resemblance
to myself.

"'Lahiri, you have come!' The saint addressed me affectionately in
Hindi. 'Rest here in this cave. It was I who <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> you.'

"I entered a neat little grotto which contained several woolen
blankets and a few KAMANDULUS (begging bowls).

"'Lahiri, do you remember that seat?' The yogi pointed to a folded
blanket in one corner.

"'No, sir.' Somewhat dazed at the strangeness of my adventure, I
added, 'I must leave now, before nightfall. I have business in the
morning at my office.'

"The mysterious saint replied in English, 'The office was <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span>
for you, and not you for the office.'

"I was dumbfounded that this forest ascetic should not only <span class="t9 t11 t20 t21 t22 t23 t27 hoverable">speak</span>
English but also paraphrase the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> of Christ. {FN34-3}

"'I see my telegram <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> effect.' The yogi's remark was incomprehensible
to me; I inquired his meaning.

"'I refer to the telegram that summoned you to these isolated parts.
It was I who silently suggested to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> of your superior officer
that you be transferred to Ranikhet. When one feels his unity with
mankind, all minds become transmitting stations through which he
can <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> at will.' He added gently, 'Lahiri, surely this cave seems
familiar to you?'

"As I maintained a bewildered silence, the saint approached and
struck me gently on the forehead. At his magnetic touch, a wondrous
current swept through my brain, releasing the sweet seed-memories
of my previous life.

"'I remember!' My <span class="t23 hoverable">voice</span> was half-choked with joyous sobs. 'You are
my guru Babaji, who has belonged to me always! Scenes of the past
arise vividly in my mind; here in this cave I spent many <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> of
my last incarnation!' As ineffable recollections overwhelmed me,
I tearfully embraced my master's feet.

"'For more than <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> decades I have waited for you here-waited
for you to return to me!' Babaji's <span class="t23 hoverable">voice</span> rang with celestial love.
'You slipped away and vanished into the tumultuous waves of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span>
beyond death. The magic wand of your karma touched you, and you
were gone! <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Though</span> you lost sight of me, never did I lose sight
of you! I pursued you over the luminescent astral sea where the

glorious angels sail. Through gloom, storm, upheaval, and <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> I
followed you, like a mother bird guarding her young. As you lived
out your <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> term of womb-life, and emerged a babe, my eye was
ever on you. When you covered your tiny <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> in the lotus posture
under the Nadia sands in your childhood, I was invisibly present!
Patiently, month after month, year after year, I have watched over
you, waiting for this perfect day. Now you are with me! Lo, here
is your cave, loved of yore! I have kept it ever clean and ready
for you. Here is your hallowed ASANA-blanket, where you daily sat
to fill your expanding <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> with God! <span class="t0 t6 t7 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t17 t20 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">Behold</span> there your bowl, from
which you often drank the nectar prepared by me! See how I have
kept the brass cup brightly polished, that you might drink again
therefrom! My own, do you now understand?'

"'My guru, what can I say?' I murmured brokenly. 'Where has one
ever <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> of such deathless love?' I gazed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> and ecstatically
on my <span class="t20 hoverable">eternal</span> treasure, my guru in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> and death.

"'Lahiri, you need purification. Drink the oil in this bowl and lie
down by the river.' Babaji's practical wisdom, I reflected with a
quick, reminiscent smile, was ever to the fore.

"I obeyed his directions. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Though</span> the icy Himalayan night was descending,
a comforting warmth, an inner radiation, began to pulsate in every
cell of my body. I marveled. Was the unknown oil endued with a

cosmical heat?

"Bitter winds whipped around me in the darkness, shrieking a fierce
challenge. The chill wavelets of the Gogash River lapped now and
then over my body, outstretched on the rocky bank. Tigers howled
near-by, but my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> was <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> of fear; the radiant force newly
generated <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> me conveyed an assurance of unassailable protection.
Several hours passed swiftly; faded memories of another <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> wove
themselves into the present brilliant pattern of reunion with my
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> guru.

"My solitary musings were interrupted by the sound of approaching
footsteps. In the darkness, a man's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> gently helped me to my
feet, and gave me some dry clothing.

"'Come, brother,' my companion said. 'The <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> awaits you.'

"He led the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> through the forest. The somber night was suddenly
lit by a steady luminosity in the distance.

"'Can that be the sunrise?' I inquired. 'Surely the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> night
has not passed?'

"'The hour is midnight.' My guide laughed softly. 'Yonder <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span>
is the glow of a golden palace, materialized here tonight by the

peerless Babaji. In the dim past, you once expressed a <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> to
enjoy the beauties of a palace. Our <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> is now satisfying your
wish, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> freeing you from the bonds of karma.' {FN34-4} He added,
'The magnificent palace will be the scene of your initiation tonight
into KRIYA YOGA. All your brothers here join in a paean of welcome,
rejoicing at the end of your <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> exile. Behold!'

"A vast palace of dazzling gold stood before us. Studded with
countless jewels, and <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> amidst landscaped gardens, it presented
a spectacle of unparalleled grandeur. Saints of angelic countenance
were stationed by resplendent gates, half-reddened by the glitter
of rubies. Diamonds, pearls, sapphires, and emeralds of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> size
and luster were imbedded in the decorative arches.

"I followed my companion into a spacious reception hall. The odor
of incense and of roses wafted through the air; dim lamps shed
a multicolored glow. Small groups of devotees, some fair, some
dark-skinned, chanted musically, or sat in the meditative posture,
immersed in an inner peace. A vibrant joy pervaded the atmosphere.

"'Feast your eyes; enjoy the artistic splendors of this palace,
for it has been <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> into being solely in your honor.' My guide
smiled sympathetically as I uttered a few ejaculations of wonderment.

"'Brother,' I said, 'the beauty of this structure surpasses the

bounds of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> imagination. Please tell me the mystery of its
origin.'

"'I will gladly enlighten you.' My companion's dark <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> sparkled
with wisdom. 'In reality there is nothing inexplicable about this
materialization. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> cosmos is a materialized <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> of the
Creator. This heavy, earthly clod, floating in space, is a dream
of God. He made all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> out of His consciousness, even as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span>
in his dream <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> reproduces and vivifies a <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span> with
its creatures.

"'God first <span class="t16 hoverable">created</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> as an idea. Then He quickened it;
energy atoms came into being. He coordinated the atoms into this
solid sphere. All its molecules are held <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> by the will of

into energy. Energy will dissolve into consciousness; the earth-idea
will disappear from objectivity.

"'The substance of a dream is held in materialization by the
subconscious <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> of the dreamer. When that cohesive <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span>
is withdrawn in wakefulness, the dream and its elements dissolve.
A <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> closes his <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> and erects a dream-creation which, on awakening,
he effortlessly dematerializes. He follows the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> archetypal
pattern. Similarly, when he awakens in cosmic consciousness, he
will effortlessly dematerialize the illusions of the cosmic dream.

He added, 'When this structure has served its purpose, Babaji will
dematerialize it.'

"As I remained silent in awe, my guide made a sweeping gesture. 'This
shimmering palace, superbly embellished with jewels, has not been
built by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> effort or with laboriously mined gold and gems. It
stands solidly, a monumental challenge to man. {FN34-5} Whoever
realizes himself as a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> of God, even as Babaji has done, can
reach any goal by the infinite powers hidden <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> him. A common
stone locks <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> itself the secret of stupendous atomic energy;
{FN34-6} even so, a mortal is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> a powerhouse of divinity.'

"The sage picked up from a near-by table a graceful vase <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> handle
was blazing with diamonds. 'Our <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> guru <span class="t16 hoverable">created</span> this palace by
solidifying myriads of <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> cosmic rays,' he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> on. 'Touch this
vase and its diamonds; they will satisfy all the tests of sensory
experience.'

"I examined the vase, and passed my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> over the smooth room-walls,
thick with glistening gold. Each of the jewels scattered lavishly
about was worthy of a king's collection. Deep satisfaction spread
over my mind. A submerged desire, hidden in my subconsciousness
from lives now gone, seemed simultaneously gratified and extinguished.

"My stately companion led me through ornate arches and corridors
into a series of chambers richly furnished in the style of an
emperor's palace. We entered an immense hall. In the center stood
a golden throne, encrusted with jewels shedding a dazzling medley
of colors. There, in lotus posture, sat the supreme Babaji. I
knelt on the shining floor at his feet.

"'Lahiri, are you still feasting on your dream desires for a golden
palace?' My guru's <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> were twinkling like his own sapphires.
'Wake! All your earthly thirsts are about to be quenched forever.'
He murmured some mystic <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> of blessing. 'My son, arise. Receive
your initiation into the kingdom of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> through KRIYA YOGA.'

"Babaji stretched out his hand; a HOMA (sacrificial) <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> appeared,
surrounded by fruits and flowers. I received the liberating yogic
technique before this flaming altar.

"The rites were completed in the early dawn. I felt no need for
sleep in my ecstatic state, and wandered around the palace, filled

on all sides with treasures and priceless OBJETS D'ART. Descending
to the gorgeous gardens, I noticed, near-by, the same caves and
barren mountain ledges which yesterday had boasted no adjacency to
palace or flowered terrace.

"Reentering the palace, fabulously glistening in the cold Himalayan
sunlight, I sought the presence of my master. He was still enthroned,
surrounded by many quiet disciples.

"'Lahiri, you are hungry.' Babaji added, 'Close your eyes.'

"When I reopened them, the enchanting palace and its picturesque
gardens had disappeared. My own <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> and the forms of Babaji
and the cluster of chelas were all now seated on the bare ground
at the exact site of the vanished palace, not far from the sunlit
entrances of the rocky grottos. I recalled that my guide had remarked
that the palace <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be dematerialized, its captive atoms released
into the thought-essence from which it had sprung. Although stunned,
I looked trustingly at my guru. I knew not what to expect next on
this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> of miracles.

"'The purpose for which the palace was <span class="t16 hoverable">created</span> has now been served,'
Babaji explained. He lifted an earthen vessel from the ground. 'Put
your <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> there and receive whatever <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> you desire.'

"As soon as I touched the broad, empty bowl, it became heaped
with hot butter-fried LUCHIS, curry, and rare sweetmeats. I helped
myself, observing that the vessel was ever-filled. At the end of my
meal I looked around for water. My guru pointed to the bowl before
me. Lo! the <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> had vanished; in its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> was water, clear as
from a mountain stream.

"'Few mortals know that the kingdom of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> includes the kingdom of
mundane fulfillments,' Babaji observed. 'The <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> realm extends
to the earthly, but the latter, being illusory, cannot include the
essence of reality.'

"'Beloved guru, last night you demonstrated for me the link of
beauty in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heaven</span> and earth!' I smiled at memories of the vanished
palace; surely no simple yogi had ever received initiation into the
august mysteries of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Spirit</span> amidst surroundings of more impressive
luxury! I gazed tranquilly at the stark contrast of the present
scene. The gaunt ground, the skyey roof, the caves <span class="t22 t23 t28 hoverable">offering</span> primitive
shelter-all seemed a gracious natural setting for the seraphic
saints around me.

"I sat that afternoon on my blanket, hallowed by associations of
past-life realizations. My <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> guru approached and passed his
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> over my head. I entered the NIRBIKALPA SAMADHI state, remaining
unbrokenly in its bliss for seven days. Crossing the successive

strata of self-knowledge, I penetrated the deathless realms of
reality. All delusive limitations dropped away; my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> was fully
established on the <span class="t20 hoverable">eternal</span> altar of the Cosmic Spirit. On the eighth
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> I fell at my guru's feet and implored him to keep me always
near him in this sacred wilderness.

"'My son,' Babaji said, embracing me, 'your role in this incarnation
must be played on an outward stage. Prenatally <span class="t11 hoverable">blessed</span> by many lives
of lonely meditation, you must now mingle in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> of men.

"'A deep purpose underlay the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that you did not meet me this
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> until you were already a married man, with modest business
responsibilities. You must put aside your thoughts of joining our

serving as an example of the ideal yogi-householder.

"'The cries of many bewildered worldly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> and women have not fallen

like themselves. You must guide them to see that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> yogic
attainments are not barred to the family man. Even in the world,
the yogi who faithfully discharges his responsibilities, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span>
personal motive or attachment, treads the sure path of enlightenment.

"'No necessity compels you to leave the world, for inwardly you
have already sundered its every karmic tie. Not of this world, you
must <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> be in it. Many <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> still remain during which you must
conscientiously fulfill your family, business, civic, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span>
duties. A sweet new breath of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> hope will penetrate the
arid hearts of worldly men. From your balanced life, they will
understand that liberation is dependent on inner, rather than outer,
renunciations.'

"How remote seemed my family, the office, the world, as I listened
to my guru in the <span class="t23 hoverable">high</span> Himalayan solitudes. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> adamantine <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span>
rang in his words; I submissively agreed to leave this <span class="t11 hoverable">blessed</span>
haven of peace. Babaji instructed me in the ancient rigid rules
which govern the transmission of the yogic <span class="t2 t6 t8 t9 t10 t15 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">art</span> from guru to disciple.

"'Bestow the KRIYA key only on qualified chelas,' Babaji said.
'He who vows to <span class="t2 t9 t10 t16 t18 t19 t27 t28 hoverable">sacrifice</span> all in the quest of the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> is fit to
unravel the final mysteries of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> through the science of meditation.'

"'Angelic guru, as you have already favored mankind by resurrecting
the lost KRIYA art, will you not increase that benefit by relaxing
the strict requirements for discipleship?' I gazed beseechingly
at Babaji. 'I pray that you permit me to communicate KRIYA to all
seekers, even <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> at first they cannot vow themselves to complete

inner renunciation. The tortured <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> and women of the world, pursued
by the threefold suffering, {FN34-7} need special encouragement.
They may never attempt the road to freedom if KRIYA initiation be
withheld from them.'

"'Be it so. The <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> wish has been expressed through you.' With
these simple words, the merciful guru banished the rigorous safeguards
that for ages had hidden KRIYA from the world. 'Give KRIYA freely
to all who humbly ask for help.'

"After a silence, Babaji added, 'Repeat to each of your disciples
this majestic promise from the BHAGAVAD GITA: "SWALPAMASYA DHARMASYA,
TRAYATA MAHATO BHOYAT"--"Even a little bit of the practice of this
religion will save you from dire fears and colossal sufferings."'
{FN34-8}

"As I knelt the next morning at my guru's feet for his farewell
blessing, he sensed my deep reluctance to leave him.

"'There is no separation for us, my beloved child.' He touched my
shoulder affectionately. 'Wherever you are, whenever you <span class="t3 t11 t18 t27 hoverable">call</span> me,
I shall be with you instantly.'

"Consoled by his wondrous promise, and rich with the newly found gold
of God-wisdom, I wended my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> down the mountain. At the office I

was welcomed by my fellow employees, who for ten <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">days</span> had <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span>
me lost in the Himalayan jungles. A letter soon arrived from the
<span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> office.

"'Lahiri should return to the Danapur {FN34-9} office,' it read.
'His transfer to Ranikhet occurred by error. Another <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> should
have been sent to assume the Ranikhet duties.'

"I smiled, reflecting on the hidden crosscurrents in the events
which had led me to this furthermost spot of India.

"Before returning to Danapur, I spent a few <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">days</span> with a Bengali
family at Moradabad. A party of six friends gathered to greet me.
As I turned the conversation to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> subjects, my host observed
gloomily:

"'Oh, in these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">days</span> India is destitute of saints!'

"'Babu,' I protested warmly, 'of course there are still <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>
masters in this land!'

"In a mood of exalted fervor, I felt impelled to relate my miraculous
experiences in the Himalayas. The little company was politely
incredulous.

"'Lahiri,' one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> said soothingly, 'your <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> has been under a
strain in those rarefied mountain airs. This is some daydream you
have recounted.'

"Burning with the enthusiasm of truth, I spoke <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> due thought.
'If I <span class="t3 t11 t18 t27 hoverable">call</span> him, my guru will appear right in this house.'

"Interest gleamed in every eye; it was no wonder that the group
was eager to <span class="t0 t6 t7 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t17 t20 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">behold</span> a saint materialized in such a strange way.
Half-reluctantly, I asked for a quiet room and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> new woolen
blankets.

"'The <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> will materialize from the ether,' I said. 'Remain
silently outside the door; I shall soon <span class="t3 t11 t18 t27 hoverable">call</span> you.'

"I sank into the meditative state, humbly summoning my guru. The
darkened room soon filled with a dim aural moonlight; the luminous
figure of Babaji emerged.

"'Lahiri, do you <span class="t3 t11 t18 t27 hoverable">call</span> me for a trifle?' The master's gaze was stern.
'Truth is for earnest seekers, not for those of idle curiosity. It
is easy to believe when one sees; there is nothing then to deny.
Supersensual <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> is deserved and discovered by those who overcome
their natural materialistic skepticism.' He added gravely, 'Let me
go!'

"I fell entreatingly at his feet. 'Holy guru, I realize my serious
error; I humbly ask pardon. It was to create <span class="t4 t7 t12 t16 hoverable">faith</span> in these
spiritually blinded minds that I ventured to <span class="t3 t11 t18 t27 hoverable">call</span> you. Because you
have graciously appeared at my prayer, please do not depart <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span>
bestowing a blessing on my friends. Unbelievers <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> they be,
at least they were willing to investigate the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> of my strange
assertions.'

"'Very well; I will stay awhile. I do not wish your <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> discredited
before your friends.' Babaji's face had softened, but he added
gently, 'Henceforth, my son, I shall come when you need me, and
not always when you <span class="t3 t11 t18 t27 hoverable">call</span> me. {FN34-10}'

"Tense silence reigned in the little group when I opened the door.
As if mistrusting their senses, my friends stared at the lustrous
figure on the blanket seat.

"'This is mass-hypnotism!' One <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> laughed blatantly. 'No one could
possibly have entered this room <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> our knowledge!'

"Babaji advanced smilingly and motioned to each one to touch the
warm, solid <span class="t21 hoverable">flesh</span> of his body. Doubts dispelled, my friends prostrated
themselves on the floor in awed repentance.

"'Let HALUA {FN34-11} be prepared.' Babaji made this request,
I knew, to further assure the group of his <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> reality. While
the porridge was boiling, the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> guru chatted affably. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Great</span>
was the metamorphosis of these doubting Thomases into devout St.
Pauls. After we had eaten, Babaji <span class="t11 hoverable">blessed</span> each of us in turn. There
was a sudden flash; we witnessed the instantaneous dechemicalization
of the electronic elements of Babaji's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> into a spreading vaporous
light. The God-tuned will <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> had loosened its
grasp of the ether atoms held <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> as his body; forthwith the
trillions of tiny lifetronic sparks faded into the infinite reservoir.

"'With my own <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> I have seen the conqueror of death.' Maitra,
{FN34-12} one of the group, spoke reverently. His face was
transfigured with the joy of his recent awakening. 'The supreme
guru played with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> and space, as a child plays with bubbles. I
have beheld one with the keys of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heaven</span> and earth.'

"I soon returned to Danapur. Firmly anchored in the Spirit, again I
assumed the manifold business and family obligations of a householder."

Lahiri Mahasaya also related to Swami Kebalananda and Sri Yukteswar
the story of another meeting with Babaji, under circumstances which
recalled the guru's promise: "I shall come whenever you need me."

"The scene was a KUMBHA MELA at Allahabad," Lahiri Mahasaya told

his disciples. "I had gone there during a short vacation from my
office duties. As I wandered amidst the throng of monks and sadhus
who had come from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> distances to attend the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">holy</span> festival, I
noticed an ash-smeared ascetic who was holding a begging bowl. The
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> arose in my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> was hypocritical, wearing
the outward symbols of renunciation <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> a corresponding inward
grace.

"No sooner had I passed the ascetic than my astounded eye fell on
Babaji. He was kneeling in front of a matted-haired anchorite.

"'Guruji!' I hastened to his side. 'Sir, what are you doing here?'

"'I am washing the feet of this renunciate, and then I shall clean
his cooking utensils.' Babaji smiled at me like a little child; I
knew he was intimating that he wanted me to criticize no one, but
to see the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> as residing equally in all body-temples, <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> of
superior or inferior men. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> guru added, 'By serving <span class="t8 t12 t17 hoverable">wise</span>
and ignorant sadhus, I am learning the greatest of virtues, pleasing
to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> above all others-humility.'"

me then of Babaji's materialization before the group in Moradabad.

"Thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness." {FN35-1} In
these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> to John the Baptist, and in asking John to baptize him,
<span class="t0 t6 t8 t9 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t22 t23 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Jesus</span> was acknowledging the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> rights of his guru.

From a reverent study of the Bible from an Oriental viewpoint,
{FN35-2} and from intuitional perception, I am convinced that
John the Baptist was, in past lives, the guru of Christ. There are
numerous passages in the Bible which infer that John and <span class="t0 t6 t8 t9 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t22 t23 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Jesus</span> in
their last incarnations were, respectively, Elijah and his disciple
Elisha. (These are the spellings in the Old Testament. The Greek
translators spelled the names as Elias and Eliseus; they reappear
in the New Testament in these changed forms.)

The very end of the Old Testament is a prediction of the reincarnation
of Elijah and Elisha: "Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet
before the coming of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> and dreadful <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> of the Lord."

<span class="t0 t6 t8 t9 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t22 t23 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Jesus</span> twice unequivocally identified Elijah (Elias) as John: "Elias

wealth to his disciple Elisha. "And Elisha said, I pray thee, let
a double portion of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thy</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> me. And he said, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thou</span> <span class="t0 t6 t12 t13 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">hast</span>

The roles became reversed, because Elijah-John was no longer needed
to be the ostensible guru of Elisha-Jesus, now perfected in <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span>

guru Elias, with Moses, whom he saw. Again, in his hour of extremity

The <span class="t20 hoverable">eternal</span> bond of guru and disciple that existed between John and
<span class="t0 t6 t8 t9 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t22 t23 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Jesus</span> was present also for Babaji and Lahiri Mahasaya. With tender
solicitude the deathless guru swam the Lethean waters that swirled
between the last <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> lives of his chela, and guided the successive
steps <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> by the child and then by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> Lahiri Mahasaya.
It was not until the disciple had reached his thirty-third year
that Babaji deemed the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> to be ripe to openly reestablish the
never-severed link. Then, after their brief meeting near Ranikhet,
the selfless <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> banished his dearly-beloved disciple from the
little mountain group, releasing him for an outward <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> mission.
"My son, I shall come whenever you need me." What mortal lover can
bestow that infinite promise?

Unknown to <span class="t1 hoverable">society</span> in general, a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> renaissance began
to flow from a remote corner of Benares. Just as the fragrance of
flowers cannot be suppressed, so Lahiri Mahasaya, quietly living
as an ideal householder, could not hide his innate glory. Slowly,
from every part of India, the devotee-bees sought the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> nectar
of the liberated master.

The English office superintendent was one of the first to notice a
strange transcendental change in his employee, whom he endearingly
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> "Ecstatic Babu."

"Sir, you seem sad. What is the trouble?" Lahiri Mahasaya made this
sympathetic inquiry one morning to his employer.

"My wife in England is critically ill. I am torn by anxiety."

"I shall get you some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> about her." Lahiri Mahasaya <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> the
room and sat for a short <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> in a secluded spot. On his return he
smiled consolingly.

"Your wife is improving; she is now writing you a letter." The
omniscient yogi quoted some parts of the missive.

"Ecstatic Babu, I already know that you are no ordinary man. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> I
am unable to believe that, at will, you can banish <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> and space!"

The promised letter finally arrived. The astounded superintendent
found that it contained not only the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> news of his wife's
recovery, but also the same phrases which, weeks earlier, Lahiri
Mahasaya had repeated.

The wife came to India some months later. She visited the office,

where Lahiri Mahasaya was quietly sitting at his desk. The woman
approached him reverently.

"Sir," she said, "it was your form, haloed in glorious light, that
I beheld months ago by my sickbed in London. At that moment I was
completely healed! Soon after, I was able to undertake the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span>
ocean voyage to India."

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Day</span> after day, one or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> devotees besought the sublime guru for
KRIYA initiation. In addition to these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> duties, and to
those of his business and family life, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> an
enthusiastic interest in education. He organized many study groups,
and played an active part in the growth of a large <span class="t23 hoverable">high</span> school in
the Bengalitola section of Benares. His regular discourses on the
scriptures came to be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> his "GITA Assembly," eagerly attended
by many truth-seekers.

By these manifold activities, Lahiri Mahasaya sought to answer the
common challenge: "After performing one's business and social duties,
where is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> for devotional meditation?" The harmoniously balanced
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> householder-guru became the silent inspiration
of thousands of questioning hearts. Earning only a modest salary,
thrifty, unostentatious, accessible to all, the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> carried on
naturally and happily in the path of worldly life.

Though ensconced in the seat of the Supreme One, Lahiri Mahasaya
showed reverence to all men, irrespective of their differing
merits. When his devotees saluted him, he bowed in turn to them.
With a childlike humility, the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> often touched the feet
of others, but seldom allowed them to pay him similar honor, even
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> such obeisance toward the guru is an ancient Oriental custom.

A significant feature of Lahiri Mahasaya's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> was his gift
of KRIYA initiation to those of every faith. Not Hindus only, but
Moslems and Christians were among his foremost disciples. Monists
and dualists, those of all faiths or of no established faith, were
impartially received and instructed by the universal guru. One of
his highly advanced chelas was Abdul Gufoor Khan, a Mohammedan. It
shows <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> courage on the part of Lahiri Mahasaya that, although
a high-caste Brahmin, he tried his utmost to dissolve the rigid
caste bigotry of his time. Those from every walk of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> found
shelter under the master's omnipresent wings. Like all God-inspired
prophets, Lahiri Mahasaya gave new hope to the outcastes and
down-trodden of society.

"Always remember that you belong to no one, and no one belongs to
you. Reflect that some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> you will suddenly have to leave everything

guru told his disciples. "Prepare yourself for the coming astral
journey of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">death</span> by daily riding in the balloon of God-perception.

Through delusion you are perceiving yourself as a bundle of <span class="t21 hoverable">flesh</span>
and bones, which at best is a nest of troubles. {FN35-12} Meditate
unceasingly, that you may quickly <span class="t0 t6 t7 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t17 t20 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">behold</span> yourself as the Infinite
Essence, <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> from every <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of misery. Cease being a prisoner
of the body; using the secret key of KRIYA, learn to escape into
Spirit."

The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> guru encouraged his various students to adhere to
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> traditional discipline of their own faith. Stressing the
all-inclusive <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of KRIYA as a practical technique of liberation,
Lahiri Mahasaya then gave his chelas liberty to express their lives
in conformance with environment and up bringing.

"A Moslem should perform his NAMAJ {FN35-13} worship four times
daily," the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> pointed out. "Four times daily a Hindu should
sit in meditation. A Christian should go down on his knees four
times daily, praying to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> and then reading the Bible."

With <span class="t8 t12 t17 hoverable">wise</span> discernment the guru guided his followers into the paths
of BHAKTI (devotion), KARMA (action), JNANA (wisdom), or RAJA (royal
or complete) YOGAS, according to each man's natural tendencies. The
master, who was slow to give his permission to devotees wishing to
enter the formal path of monkhood, always cautioned them to first
reflect <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> on the austerities of the monastic life.

The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> guru taught his disciples to avoid theoretical discussion
of the scriptures. "He only is <span class="t8 t12 t17 hoverable">wise</span> who devotes himself to realizing,
not reading only, the ancient revelations," he said. "Solve all
your problems through meditation. {FN35-14} Exchange unprofitable
religious speculations for actual God-contact. Clear your <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> of

The master's omnipresence was demonstrated one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> before a group
of disciples who were listening to his exposition of the BHAGAVAD
GITA. As he was explaining the <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> of KUTASTHA CHAITANYA or

suddenly gasped and cried out:

"I am drowning in the bodies of many souls off the coast of Japan!"

The next morning the chelas read a newspaper <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">death</span>

Japan.

The distant disciples of Lahiri Mahasaya were often made aware of
his enfolding presence. "I am ever with those who practice KRIYA,"
he said consolingly to chelas who could not remain near him. "I
will guide you to the Cosmic Home through your enlarging perceptions."

Swami Satyananda was told by a devotee that, unable to go to Benares,
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> had nevertheless received precise KRIYA initiation in a
dream. Lahiri Mahasaya had appeared to instruct the chela in answer
to his prayers.

If a disciple neglected any of his worldly obligations, the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span>
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> gently correct and discipline him.

"Lahiri Mahasaya's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> were mild and healing, even when he was
forced to <span class="t9 t11 t20 t21 t22 t23 t27 hoverable">speak</span> openly of a chela's faults," Sri Yukteswar once
told me. He added ruefully, "No disciple ever fled from our master's
barbs." I could not help laughing, but I truthfully assured Sri
Yukteswar that, sharp or not, his every <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> was music to my ears.

Lahiri Mahasaya carefully graded KRIYA into four progressive
initiations. {FN35-15} He bestowed the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> techniques only
after the devotee had manifested definite <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> progress. One
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> a certain chela, convinced that his worth was not being duly
evaluated, gave <span class="t23 hoverable">voice</span> to his discontent.

"Master," he said, "surely I am ready now for the <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> initiation."

At this moment the door opened to admit a humble disciple, Brinda
Bhagat. He was a Benares postman.

"Brinda, sit by me here." The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> guru smiled at him affectionately.
"Tell me, are you ready for the <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> technique of KRIYA?"

The little postman folded his <span class="t13 t23 hoverable">hands</span> in supplication. "Gurudeva," he
said in alarm, "no more initiations, please! How can I assimilate
any <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> teachings? I have come today to ask your blessings,
because the first <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> KRIYA has filled me with such intoxication
that I cannot deliver my letters!"

"Already Brinda swims in the sea of Spirit." At these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> from
Lahiri Mahasaya, his other disciple hung his head.

"Master," he said, "I see I have been a poor workman, finding fault
with my tools."

The postman, who was an uneducated man, later developed his insight
through KRIYA to such an extent that scholars occasionally sought
his interpretation on involved scriptural points. Innocent alike of
<span class="t0 t9 t11 t14 t17 t28 hoverable">sin</span> and syntax, little Brinda won renown in the domain of learned

pundits.

Besides the numerous Benares disciples of Lahiri Mahasaya, hundreds
came to him from distant parts of India. He himself traveled to Bengal
on several occasions, visiting at the homes of the fathers-in-law
of his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> sons. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> <span class="t11 hoverable">blessed</span> by his presence, Bengal became
honeycombed with small KRIYA groups. Particularly in the districts
of Krishnagar and Bishnupur, many silent devotees to this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> have
kept the invisible current of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> flowing.

Among many saints who received KRIYA from Lahiri Mahasaya may be
mentioned the illustrious Swami Vhaskarananda Saraswati of Benares,
and the Deogarh ascetic of <span class="t23 hoverable">high</span> stature, Balananda Brahmachari.
For a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> Lahiri Mahasaya served as private tutor to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> of
Maharaja Iswari Narayan Sinha Bahadur of Benares. Recognizing the
master's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> attainment, the maharaja, as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as his son,
sought KRIYA initiation, as did the Maharaja Jotindra Mohan Thakur.

A <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> of Lahiri Mahasaya's disciples with influential worldly
position were desirous of expanding the KRIYA circle by publicity.
The guru refused his permission. One chela, the royal physician
to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> of Benares, started an organized effort to spread the
master's name as "Kashi Baba" (Exalted One of Benares). {FN35-16}
Again the guru forbade it.

"Let the fragrance of the KRIYA flower be wafted naturally, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span>
any display," he said. "Its seeds will <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> root in the soil of
spiritually fertile hearts."

Although the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> did not adopt the system of preaching
through the modern medium of an organization, or through the
printing press, he knew that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of his message <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> rise
like a resistless flood, inundating by its own force the banks of
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> minds. The changed and purified lives of devotees were the
simple guarantees of the deathless vitality of KRIYA.

In 1886, twenty-five <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> after his Ranikhet initiation, Lahiri
Mahasaya was retired on a pension. {FN35-17} With his availability
in the daytime, disciples sought him out in ever-increasing numbers.
The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> guru now sat in silence most of the time, locked in the
tranquil lotus posture. He seldom <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> his little parlor, even
for a walk or to visit other parts of the house. A quiet stream of
chelas arrived, almost ceaselessly, for a DARSHAN (holy sight) of
the guru.

To the awe of all beholders, Lahiri Mahasaya's habitual physiological
<span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> exhibited the superhuman features of breathlessness, sleeplessness,
cessation of pulse and heartbeat, calm <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> unblinking for hours,
and a profound aura of peace. No visitors departed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> upliftment
of spirit; all knew they had received the silent blessing of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span>

man of God.

The <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> now permitted his disciple, Panchanon Bhattacharya, to
open an "Arya Mission Institution" in Calcutta. Here the saintly
disciple spread the message of KRIYA YOGA, and prepared for public
benefit certain yogic herbal {FN35-18} medicines.

In accordance with ancient custom, the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> gave to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> in
general a NEEM {FN35-19} oil for the cure of various diseases. When
the guru requested a disciple to distil the oil, he could easily
accomplish the task. If anyone else tried, he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> encounter strange
difficulties, finding that the medicinal oil had almost evaporated
after going through the required distilling processes. Evidently
the master's blessing was a necessary ingredient.

(SIGNED) "SRI SHYAMA CHARAN DEVA SHARMAN"

The Arya Mission Institution undertook the publication of many
of the guru's scriptural commentaries. Like <span class="t0 t6 t8 t9 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t22 t23 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Jesus</span> and other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>
prophets, Lahiri Mahasaya himself wrote no books, but his penetrating
interpretations were recorded and arranged by various disciples.
Some of these voluntary amanuenses were more discerning than others
in correctly conveying the profound insight of the guru; yet, on
the whole, their efforts were successful. Through their zeal, the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> possesses unparalleled commentaries by Lahiri Mahasaya on
twenty-six ancient scriptures.

Sri Ananda Mohan Lahiri, a grandson of the master, has <span class="t0 t11 t24 hoverable">written</span> an
interesting booklet on KRIYA. "The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> of the BHAGAVAD GITA is a

knot-points (VYAS-KUTAS)," Sri Ananda wrote. "Keep those knot-points
unquestioned, and we <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> nothing but mythical stories of a peculiar
and easily-misunderstood type. Keep those knot-points unexplained,
and we have lost a science which the East has preserved with
superhuman patience after a quest of thousands of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> of experiment.
{FN35-20} It was the commentaries of Lahiri Mahasaya which <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span>
to light, clear of allegories, the very science of religion that
had been so cleverly put out of sight in the riddle of scriptural
letters and imagery. No longer a mere unintelligible jugglery of
words, the otherwise unmeaning formulas of Vedic worship have been
proved by the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> to be <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span> of scientific significance. . . .

motive in their indulgence when there dawns on him a <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span>
of superior and lasting bliss through KRIYA. Here the give-up, the
negation of the lower passions, synchronizes with a take-up, the
assertion of a beatitude. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Without</span> such a course, hundreds of moral

pure devotion and consequently pure knowledge."

Just as Babaji is among the greatest of avatars, a MAHAVATAR, and
Sri Yukteswar a JNANAVATAR or Incarnation of Wisdom, so Lahiri
Mahasaya may justly be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> YOGAVATAR, or Incarnation of Yoga.
By the standards of both qualitative and quantitative good, he
elevated the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> level of society.

close disciples to Christlike stature and in his wide dissemination
of <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> among the masses, Lahiri Mahasaya ranks among the saviors

of mankind.

His uniqueness as a prophet lies in his practical stress on
a definite method, KRIYA, opening for the first <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> the doors of
yoga freedom to all men. Apart from the miracles of his own life,
surely the YOGAVATAR reached the zenith of all wonders in reducing
the ancient complexities of yoga to an effective simplicity not
beyond the ordinary grasp.

In reference to miracles, Lahiri Mahasaya often said, "The operation
of subtle laws which are unknown to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> in general should not

If in these pages I have appeared to flout his cautionary words,
it is because he has given me an inward reassurance. Also, in
recording the lives of Babaji, Lahiri Mahasaya, and Sri Yukteswar,
I have <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> it advisable to omit many <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> miraculous stories,
which could hardly have been included <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> writing, also, an
explanatory volume of abstruse philosophy.

New hope for new men! "Divine union," the YOGAVATAR proclaimed, "is
possible through self-effort, and is not dependent on theological
beliefs or on the arbitrary will of a Cosmic Dictator."

Through <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> of the KRIYA key, persons who cannot <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> themselves
to believe in the divinity of any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> will <span class="t0 t6 t7 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t17 t20 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">behold</span> at last the <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span>

of their application to life. One of these has been a tolerance in

CHAPTER: 36

BABAJI'S INTEREST IN THE WEST

"Master, did you ever meet Babaji?"

It was a calm summer night in Serampore; the large stars of the
tropics gleamed over our heads as I sat by Sri Yukteswar's <span class="t6 hoverable">side</span> on
the second-story balcony of the hermitage.

"Yes." <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> smiled at my direct question; his <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> lit with
reverence. "Three times I have been <span class="t11 hoverable">blessed</span> by the sight of the
deathless guru. Our first meeting was in Allahabad at a KUMBHA
MELA."

The religious fairs held in India since <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> immemorial are known

as KUMBHA MELAS; they have kept <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> goals in constant sight
of the multitude. Devout Hindus gather by the millions every six
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> to meet thousands of sadhus, yogis, swamis, and ascetics of
all kinds. Many are hermits who never leave their secluded haunts
except to attend the MELAS and bestow their blessings on worldly
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> and women.

"I was not a swami at the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> I met Babaji," Sri Yukteswar <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> on.
"But I had already received KRIYA initiation from Lahiri Mahasaya.
He encouraged me to attend the MELA which was convening in January,
1894 at Allahabad. It was my first experience of a KUMBHA; I felt
slightly dazed by the clamor and surge of the crowd. In my searching
gazes around I saw no illumined face of a master. Passing a bridge
on the bank of the Ganges, I noticed an acquaintance standing
near-by, his begging bowl extended.

"'Oh, this fair is nothing but a chaos of noise and beggars,'
I <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> in disillusionment. 'I wonder if Western scientists,
patiently enlarging the realms of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> for the practical <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span>
of mankind, are not more pleasing to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> than these idlers who
profess religion but concentrate on alms.'

"My smouldering reflections on social reform were interrupted by
the <span class="t23 hoverable">voice</span> of a tall sannyasi who halted before me.

"'Sir,' he said, 'a saint is calling you.'

"'Who is he?'

"'Come and see for yourself.'

"Hesitantly following this laconic advice, I soon found myself
near a tree <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> branches were sheltering a guru with an attractive
group of disciples. The master, a bright unusual figure, with
sparkling dark eyes, rose at my approach and embraced me.

"'Welcome, Swamiji,' he said affectionately.

"'Sir,' I replied emphatically, 'I am NOT a swami.'

"'Those on whom I am divinely directed to bestow the title
of "swami" never cast it off.' The saint addressed me simply, but
deep conviction of <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> rang in his words; I was engulfed in an
instant wave of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> blessing. Smiling at my sudden elevation
into the ancient monastic order, {FN36-1} I bowed at the feet of
the obviously <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> and angelic being in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> who had <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span>
honored me.

"Babaji-for it was indeed he-motioned me to a seat near him under
the tree. He was strong and young, and looked like Lahiri Mahasaya;

yet the resemblance did not strike me, even <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> I had often

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> guru wished me to be perfectly natural in his presence, not
overawed by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of his identity.

"'What do you think of the KUMBHA MELA?'

"'I was greatly disappointed, sir.' I added hastily, 'Up until the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> I met you. Somehow saints and this commotion don't seem to
belong together.'

"'Child,' the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> said, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> apparently I was nearly twice
his own age, 'for the faults of the many, judge not the whole.

"In <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of my own meeting with this exalted master, I quickly
agreed with his observation.

"'Sir,' I commented, 'I have been thinking of the scientific
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> of the West, greater by far in <span class="t14 t24 hoverable">intelligence</span> than most <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span>

congregated here, living in distant Europe and America, professing
different creeds, and ignorant of the real values of such MELAS
as the present one. They are the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> who could benefit greatly by
meetings with India's masters. But, although <span class="t23 hoverable">high</span> in intellectual
attainments, many Westerners are wedded to rank materialism. Others,
famous in science and philosophy, do not recognize the essential
unity in religion. Their creeds serve as insurmountable barriers
that threaten to separate them from us forever.'

"'I saw that you are interested in the West, as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as the East.'
Babaji's face beamed with approval. 'I felt the pangs of your heart,
broad enough for all men, <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> Oriental or Occidental. That is
why I summoned you here.

"'East and West must establish a golden middle path of activity
and spirituality combined,' he continued. 'India has much to learn
from the West in material development; in return, India can teach
the universal methods by which the West will be able to base its
religious beliefs on the unshakable foundations of yogic science.

"'You, Swamiji, have a part to play in the coming harmonious exchange
between Orient and Occident. Some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> hence I shall send you
a disciple whom you can train for yoga dissemination in the West.
The vibrations there of many spiritually seeking souls come floodlike
to me. I perceive potential saints in America and Europe, waiting

to be awakened.'"

At this point in his story, Sri Yukteswar turned his gaze fully on
mine.

"My son," he said, smiling in the moonlight, "you are the disciple
that, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> ago, Babaji promised to send me."

I was happy to learn that Babaji had directed my steps to Sri
Yukteswar, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> it was hard for me to visualize myself in the remote
West, away from my beloved guru and the simple hermitage peace.

"Babaji then spoke of the BHAGAVAD GITA," Sri Yukteswar <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> on.
"To my astonishment, he indicated by a few <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> of praise that he
was aware of the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that I had <span class="t0 t11 t24 hoverable">written</span> interpretations on various
GITA chapters.

"'At my request, Swamiji, please undertake another task,' the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>
<span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> said. 'Will you not write a short <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">book</span> on the underlying
basic unity between the Christian and Hindu scriptures? Show by
parallel references that the inspired <span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t13 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">sons</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> have spoken the
same truths, now obscured by men's sectarian differences.'

"'Maharaj,' {FN36-2} I answered diffidently, 'what a command! Shall
I be able to fulfill it?'

"Babaji laughed softly. 'My son, why do you doubt?' he said
reassuringly. 'Indeed, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Whose</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> is all this, and Who is the
Doer of all actions? Whatever the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> has made me say is bound to
materialize as truth.'

"I deemed myself empowered by the blessings of the saint, and agreed
to write the book. Feeling reluctantly that the parting-hour had
arrived, I rose from my leafy seat.

"'Do you know Lahiri?' {FN36-3} the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> inquired. 'He is a
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> soul, isn't he? Tell him of our meeting.' He then gave me a
message for Lahiri Mahasaya.

"After I had bowed humbly in farewell, the saint smiled benignly.
'When your <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">book</span> is finished, I shall pay you a visit,' he promised.
'Good-by for the present.'

"I <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> Allahabad the following <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> and entrained for Benares.
Reaching my guru's home, I poured out the story of the wonderful
saint at the KUMBHA MELA.

"'Oh, didn't you recognize him?' Lahiri Mahasaya's <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> were dancing
with laughter. 'I see you couldn't, for he prevented you. He is my
incomparable guru, the celestial Babaji!'

"'Babaji!' I repeated, awestruck. 'The Yogi-Christ Babaji! The
invisible-visible savior Babaji! Oh, if I could just recall the
past and be once more in his presence, to show my devotion at his
lotus feet!'

"'Never mind,' Lahiri Mahasaya said consolingly. 'He has promised
to see you again.'

"'Gurudeva, the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> asked me to give you a message. "Tell
Lahiri," he said, "that the stored-up <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> for this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> now runs
low; it is nearly finished."'

"At my utterance of these enigmatic words, Lahiri Mahasaya's figure
trembled as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> touched by a lightning current. In an instant
everything about him fell silent; his smiling countenance turned
incredibly stern. Like a wooden statue, somber and immovable in
its seat, his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> became colorless. I was alarmed and bewildered.
Never in my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> had I seen this joyous <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> manifest such awful
gravity. The other disciples present stared apprehensively.

"Three hours passed in utter silence. Then Lahiri Mahasaya resumed
his natural, cheerful demeanor, and spoke affectionately to each
of the chelas. Everyone sighed in relief.

"I realized by my master's reaction that Babaji's message had been
an unmistakable signal by which Lahiri Mahasaya understood that his
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> soon be untenanted. His awesome silence proved that
my guru had instantly controlled his being, cut his last cord
of attachment to the material world, and fled to his ever-living
identity in Spirit. Babaji's remark had been his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> of saying:
'I shall be ever with you.'

"Though Babaji and Lahiri Mahasaya were omniscient, and had
no need of communicating with each other through me or any other
intermediary, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> ones often condescend to play a part in the

messengers in an ordinary way, that the final fulfillment of their
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> may infuse greater <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> <span class="t4 t7 t12 t16 hoverable">faith</span> in a wide circle of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> who
later learn the story.

"I soon <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> Benares, and <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> in Serampore on the scriptural
writings requested by Babaji," Sri Yukteswar continued. "No sooner
had I begun my task than I was able to compose a poem dedicated to
the deathless guru. The melodious lines flowed effortlessly from
my pen, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> never before had I attempted Sanskrit poetry.

"In the quiet of night I busied myself over a comparison of the
Bible and the scriptures of SANATAN DHARMA. {FN36-4} Quoting the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> of the <span class="t11 hoverable">blessed</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> Jesus, I showed that his teachings were

in essence one with the revelations of the VEDAS. To my relief,
my <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">book</span> was finished in a short time; I realized that this speedy
blessing was due to the grace of my PARAM-GURU-MAHARAJ. {FN36-5}
The chapters first appeared in the SADHUSAMBAD journal; later they
were privately printed as a <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">book</span> by one of my Kidderpore disciples.

"The morning after I had concluded my literary efforts," <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span>
continued, "I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> to the Rai Ghat here to bathe in the Ganges.
The ghat was deserted; I stood still for awhile, enjoying the sunny
peace. After a dip in the sparkling waters, I started for home.
The only sound in the silence was that of my Ganges-drenched cloth,
swish-swashing with every step. As I passed beyond the site of the
large banyan tree near the river bank, a strong impulse urged me
to look back. There, under the shade of the banyan, and surrounded
by a few disciples, sat the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Babaji!

"'Greetings, Swamiji!' The beautiful <span class="t23 hoverable">voice</span> of the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> rang
out to assure me I was not dreaming. 'I see you have successfully
completed your book. As I promised, I am here to thank you.'

"With a fast-beating heart, I prostrated myself fully at his feet.
'Param-guruji,' I said imploringly, 'will you and your chelas not
honor my near-by home with your presence?'

"The supreme guru smilingly declined. 'No, child,' he said, 'we are

people who like the shelter of trees; this spot is quite comfortable.'

"'Please tarry awhile, Master.' I gazed entreatingly at him. 'I
shall be back at once with some special sweetmeats.'

"When I returned in a few minutes with a dish of delicacies, lo! the
lordly banyan no longer sheltered the celestial troupe. I searched
all around the ghat, but in my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> I knew the little band had
already fled on etheric wings.

"I was deeply hurt. 'Even if we meet again, I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> not care to talk
to him,' I assured myself. 'He was unkind to leave me so suddenly.'
This was a wrath of love, of course, and nothing more.

"A few months later I visited Lahiri Mahasaya in Benares. As I
entered his little parlor, my guru smiled in greeting.

"'Welcome, Yukteswar,' he said. 'Did you just meet Babaji at the
threshold of my room?'

"'Why, no,' I answered in surprise.

"'Come here.' Lahiri Mahasaya touched me gently on the forehead;
at once I beheld, near the door, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of Babaji, blooming like
a perfect lotus.

"I remembered my old hurt, and did not bow. Lahiri Mahasaya looked
at me in astonishment.

"The <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> guru gazed at me with fathomless eyes. 'You are annoyed
with me.'

"'Sir, why shouldn't I be?' I answered. 'Out of the air you came
with your magic group, and into the thin air you vanished.'

"'I told you I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> see you, but didn't say how <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> remain.'
Babaji laughed softly. 'You were <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span> of excitement. I assure you
that I was fairly extinguished in the ether by the gust of your
restlessness.'

"I was instantly satisfied by this unflattering explanation. I
knelt at his feet; the supreme guru patted me kindly on the shoulder.

"'Child, you must meditate more,' he said. 'Your gaze is not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span>

into the hidden radiance.

"That was one of my last visits to Benares to see my guru," Sri
Yukteswar concluded. "Even as Babaji had foretold at the KUMBHA

to a close. During the summer of 1895 his stalwart <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> developed

a few chelas became very insistent; the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> replied cryptically:

"I entrained immediately for Benares. At my guru's home I found

"'Be comforted; I shall rise again.' After this utterance Lahiri

"Lahiri Mahasaya's beautiful body, so dear to the devotees, was
cremated with solemn householder rites at Manikarnika Ghat by the

suffused with a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> light. Lo! before me stood the <span class="t21 hoverable">flesh</span> and

when they had gazed on their living gurus after <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> death.

"When I returned to my isolated Hardwar hermitage," Keshabananda

Another disciple who was <span class="t11 hoverable">blessed</span> by the sight of his resurrected
guru was the saintly Panchanon Bhattacharya, founder of the Calcutta
Arya Mission Institution. {FN36-10}

I visited Panchanon at his Calcutta home, and listened with delight
to the story of his many <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> with the master. In conclusion, he
told me of the most marvelous event in his life.

"Here in Calcutta," Panchanon said, "at ten o'clock of the morning
which followed his cremation, Lahiri Mahasaya appeared before me
in living glory."

Swami Pranabananda, the "saint with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> bodies," also confided to

me the details of his own supernal experience.

"A few <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">days</span> before Lahiri Mahasaya <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> his body," Pranabananda told

from him, requesting me to come at once to Benares. I was delayed,
however, and could not leave immediately. As I was in the midst
of my travel preparations, about ten o'clock in the morning, I was
suddenly overwhelmed with joy to see the shining figure of my guru.

"'Why hurry to Benares?' Lahiri Mahasaya said, smiling. 'You shall
<span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> me there no longer.'

"As the import of his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> dawned on me, I sobbed broken-heartedly,
believing that I was seeing him only in a vision.

"The <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> approached me comfortingly. 'Here, touch my flesh,'
he said. 'I am living, as always. Do not lament; am I not with you
forever?'"

From the lips of these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> disciples, a story of wondrous

{FN36-1} Sri Yukteswar was later formally initiated into the Swami

{FN36-2} "Great King"-a title of respect.

{FN36-3} A guru usually refers to his own disciple simply by his
name, omitting any title. Thus, Babaji said "Lahiri," not "Lahiri
Mahasaya."

{FN36-4} Literally, "eternal religion," the name given to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span>

since the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of the Greeks who designated the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> on the banks
of the river Indus as INDOOS, or HINDUS. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> HINDU, properly
speaking, refers only to followers of SANATAN DHARMA or Hinduism.
The term INDIAN applies equally to Hindus and Mohammedans and other
INHABITANTS of the soil of India (and also through the confusing
geographical error of Columbus, to the American Mongoloid aboriginals).

The ancient name for India is ARYAVARTA, literally, "abode of the
Aryans." The Sanskrit root of ARYA is "worthy, holy, noble." The

later ethnological misuse of ARYAN to signify not spiritual, but
physical, characteristics, led the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Orientalist, Max Muller,
to say quaintly: "To me an ethnologist who speaks of an Aryan
race, Aryan blood, Aryan <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> and hair, is as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> a sinner as a
linguist who speaks of a dolichocephalic dictionary or a brachycephalic
grammar."

{FN36-5} PARAM-GURU is literally "guru supreme" or "guru beyond,"
signifying a line or succession of teachers. Babaji, the GURU of
Lahiri Mahasaya, was the PARAM-GURU of Sri Yukteswar.

{FN36-6} My visit to Keshabananda's ashram is described on pp.
405-408.

{FN36-7} September 26, 1895 is the date on which Lahiri Mahasaya <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span>
his body. In a few more <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">days</span> he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have reached his sixty-eighth

{FN36-8} Facing the north, and thrice revolving the body, are parts
of a Vedic rite <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> by masters who know beforehand when the final
hour is about to strike for the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> body. The last meditation,
during which the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> merges himself in the Cosmic AUM, is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span>
the MAHA, or great, SAMADHI.

{FN36-9} Kabir was a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> sixteenth-century saint <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> large

death, the disciples quarreled over the manner of conducting the
funeral ceremonies. The exasperated <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> rose from his final sleep,
and gave his instructions. "Half of my remains shall be buried by
the Moslem rites;" he said, "let the other half be cremated with
a Hindu sacrament." He then vanished. When the disciples opened
the coffin which had contained his body, nothing was found but a
dazzling array of gold-colored champak flowers. Half of these were
obediently buried by the Moslems, who revere his shrine to this
day.

In his youth Kabir was approached by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> disciples who wanted minute
intellectual guidance along the mystic path. The <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> responded

CHAPTER: 37

I GO TO AMERICA

"America! Surely these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> are Americans!" This was my <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span>
as a panoramic vision of Western faces passed before my inward
view.

Immersed in meditation, I was sitting behind some dusty boxes in
the storeroom of the Ranchi school. A private spot was difficult
to <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> during those busy <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> with the youngsters!

The vision continued; a vast multitude, {FN37-1} gazing at me
intently, swept actorlike across the stage of consciousness.

The storeroom door opened; as usual, one of the young lads had
discovered my hiding place.

"Come here, Bimal," I cried gaily. "I have news for you: the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span>
is calling me to America!"

"To America?" The boy echoed my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> in a tone that implied I had
said "to the moon."

"Yes! I am going forth to discover America, like Columbus. He
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> he had found India; surely there is a karmic link between
those <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> lands!"

Bimal scampered away; soon the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> school was informed by the
two-legged newspaper. {FN37-2} I summoned the bewildered faculty
and gave the school into its charge.

"I know you will keep Lahiri Mahasaya's yoga ideals of education ever
to the fore," I said. "I shall write you frequently; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> willing,
someday I shall be back."

Tears stood in my <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> as I cast a last look at the little boys
and the sunny acres of Ranchi. A definite epoch in my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> had now
closed, I knew; henceforth I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> dwell in far lands. I entrained
for Calcutta a few hours after my vision. The following <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> I
received an invitation to serve as the delegate from India to an
International Congress of Religious Liberals in America. It was
to convene that year in Boston, under the auspices of the American
Unitarian Association.

My <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> in a whirl, I sought out Sri Yukteswar in Serampore.

"Guruji, I have just been invited to address a religious congress
in America. Shall I go?"

"All doors are open for you," <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> replied simply. "It is now or
never."

"But, sir," I said in dismay, "what do I know about public speaking?
Seldom have I given a lecture, and never in English."

"English or no English, your <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> on yoga shall be <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> in the
West."

I laughed. "Well, dear guruji, I hardly think the Americans will
learn Bengali! Please bless me with a push over the hurdles of the
English language." {FN37-3}

When I broke the news of my plans to Father, he was utterly <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span>
aback. To him America seemed incredibly remote; he feared he might
never see me again.

"How can you go?" he asked sternly. "Who will finance you?" As he
had affectionately borne the expenses of my education and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span>
life, he doubtless hoped that his question <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> my project
to an embarrassing halt.

"The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> will surely finance me." As I made this reply, I <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span>
of the similar one I had given <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> ago to my brother Ananta in
Agra. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Without</span> very much guile, I added, "Father, perhaps <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> will
put it into your <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> to help me."

"No, never!" He glanced at me piteously.

I was astounded, therefore, when <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Father</span> handed me, the following
day, a check made out for a large amount.

"I give you this money," he said, "not in my capacity as a father,
but as a faithful disciple of Lahiri Mahasaya. Go then to that far
Western land; spread there the creedless teachings of KRIYA YOGA."

I was immensely touched at the selfless <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> in which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Father</span>
had been able to quickly put aside his personal desires. The just
realization had come to him during the preceding night that no
ordinary <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> for foreign travel was motivating my voyage.

"Perhaps we shall not meet again in this life." Father, who was
sixty-seven at this time, spoke sadly.

An intuitive conviction prompted me to reply, "Surely the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> will
<span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> us <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> once more."

As I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> about my preparations to leave <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> and my native
<span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">land</span> for the unknown shores of America, I experienced not a little
trepidation. I had <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> many stories about the materialistic
Western atmosphere, one very different from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> background
of India, pervaded with the centuried aura of saints. "An Oriental
teacher who will dare the Western airs," I thought, "must be hardy
beyond the trials of any Himalayan cold!"

One early morning I began to pray, with an adamant determination
to continue, to even die praying, until I <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> the <span class="t23 hoverable">voice</span> of God.
I wanted His blessing and assurance that I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> not lose myself
in the fogs of modern utilitarianism. My <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> was <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> to go to
America, but even more strongly was it resolved to hear the solace
of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> permission.

I prayed and prayed, muffling my sobs. No answer came. My silent
petition increased in excruciating crescendo until, at noon, I had
reached a zenith; my brain could no longer withstand the pressure
of my agonies. If I cried once more with an increased depth of my
inner passion, I felt as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> my brain <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> split. At that moment
there came a knock outside the vestibule adjoining the Gurpar Road
room in which I was sitting. Opening the door, I saw a young <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span>
in the scanty garb of a renunciate. He came in, closed the door
behind him and, refusing my request to sit down, indicated with a

gesture that he wished to talk to me while standing.

"He must be Babaji!" I thought, dazed, because the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> before me
had the features of a younger Lahiri Mahasaya.

He answered my thought. "Yes, I am Babaji." He spoke melodiously
in Hindi. "Our Heavenly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Father</span> has <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> your prayer. He commands
me to tell you: Follow the behests of your guru and go to America.
<span class="t28 hoverable">Fear</span> not; you will be protected."

After a vibrant pause, Babaji addressed me again. "You are the one
I have chosen to spread the message of KRIYA YOGA in the West. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Long</span>
ago I met your guru Yukteswar at a KUMBHA MELA; I told him then I
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> send you to him for training."

I was speechless, choked with devotional awe at his presence, and
deeply touched to hear from his own lips that he had guided me
to Sri Yukteswar. I lay prostrate before the deathless guru. He
graciously lifted me from the floor. Telling me many <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> about
my life, he then gave me some personal instruction, and uttered a
few secret prophecies.

"KRIYA YOGA, the scientific technique of God-realization," he finally
said with solemnity, "will ultimately spread in all lands, and aid
in harmonizing the nations through man's personal, transcendental

perception of the Infinite Father."

With a gaze of majestic power, the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> electrified me by a
glimpse of his cosmic consciousness. In a short while he started
toward the door.

"Do not try to follow me," he said. "You will not be able to do
so."

"Please, Babaji, don't go away!" I cried repeatedly. "Take me with
you!"

Looking back, he replied, "Not now. Some other time."

Overcome by emotion, I disregarded his warning. As I tried to pursue
him, I discovered that my feet were firmly rooted to the floor.
From the door, Babaji gave me a last affectionate glance. He raised
his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> of benediction and walked away, my <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> fixed on
him longingly.

After a few minutes my feet were free. I sat down and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> into a
deep meditation, unceasingly thanking <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> not only for answering my
prayer but for blessing me by a meeting with Babaji. My <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span>
seemed sanctified through the touch of the ancient, ever-youthful
master. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Long</span> had it been my burning <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> to <span class="t0 t6 t7 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t17 t20 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">behold</span> him.

Until now, I have never recounted to anyone this story of my meeting
with Babaji. Holding it as the most sacred of my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> experiences,
I have hidden it in my heart. But the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> occurred to me that
readers of this autobiography may be more inclined to believe in
the reality of the secluded Babaji and his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> interests if I
relate that I saw him with my own eyes. I have helped an artist to
draw a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> picture of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Yogi-Christ of modern India; it
appears in this book.

The eve of my departure for the United States found me in Sri
Yukteswar's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">holy</span> presence.

"Forget you were <span class="t16 t24 hoverable">born</span> a Hindu, and don't be an American. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Take</span> the

Then he <span class="t11 hoverable">blessed</span> me: "All those who come to you with faith, seeking
God, will be helped. As you look at them, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> current
emanating from your <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> will enter into their brains and change
their material habits, making them more God-conscious."

He <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> on, "Your lot to attract sincere souls is very good.

Everywhere you go, even in a wilderness, you will <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> friends."

Both of his blessings have been amply demonstrated. I came alone
to America, into a wilderness <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> a single friend, but there
I found thousands ready to receive the time-tested soul-teachings.

I <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> India in August, 1920, on THE <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">CITY</span> OF SPARTA, the first
passenger boat sailing for America after the close of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">World</span> War
I. I had been able to <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">book</span> <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> only after the removal, in ways
fairly miraculous, of many "red-tape" difficulties concerned with
the granting of my passport.

During the two-months' voyage a fellow passenger found out that I
was the Indian delegate to the Boston congress.

"Swami Yogananda," he said, with the first of many quaint
pronunciations by which I was later to hear my name spoken by the
Americans, "please favor the passengers with a lecture next Thursday
night. I think we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> all benefit by a talk on 'The Battle of

Alas! I had to fight the battle of my own life, I discovered on
Wednesday. Desperately trying to organize my ideas into a lecture
in English, I finally abandoned all preparations; my thoughts, like
a wild colt eyeing a saddle, refused any cooperation with the laws

of English grammar. Fully trusting in Master's past assurances,
however, I appeared before my Thursday audience in the saloon of
the steamer. No eloquence rose to my lips; speechlessly I stood
before the assemblage. After an endurance contest lasting ten
minutes, the audience realized my predicament and began to laugh.

[Illustration: I stand on the dais before one of my classes
in America. This class of a <span class="t15 t23 hoverable">thousand</span> yoga students was held in
Washington, D.C.--see dc.jpg]

The situation was not funny to me at the moment; indignantly I sent
a silent prayer to Master.

"You CAN! Speak!" His <span class="t23 hoverable">voice</span> sounded instantly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> my consciousness.

My thoughts fell at once into a friendly relation with the English
language. Forty-five minutes later the audience was still attentive.
The talk won me a <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> of invitations to lecture later before
various groups in America.

I never could remember, afterward, a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> that I had spoken. By
discreet inquiry I learned from a <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> of passengers: "You gave
an inspiring lecture in stirring and correct English." At this
delightful news I humbly thanked my guru for his timely help,
realizing anew that he was ever with me, setting at naught all

barriers of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> and space.

Once in awhile, during the remainder of the ocean trip, I experienced
a few apprehensive twinges about the coming English-lecture ordeal
at the Boston congress.

"Lord," I prayed, "please let my inspiration be Thyself, and not
again the laughter-bombs of the audience!"

THE <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">CITY</span> OF SPARTA docked near Boston in late September. On the
sixth of October I addressed the congress with my maiden speech in
America. It was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> received; I sighed in relief. The magnanimous
secretary of the American Unitarian Association wrote the following
comment in a published <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> {FN37-4} of the congress proceedings:

"Swami Yogananda, delegate from the Brahmacharya Ashram of Ranchi,
India, <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> the greetings of his Association to the Congress.
In fluent English and a forcible delivery he gave an address of
a philosophical character on 'The Science of Religion,' which has
been printed in pamphlet <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> for a wider distribution. Religion,
he maintained, is universal and it is one. We cannot possibly
universalize particular customs and convictions, but the common
element in religion can be universalized, and we can ask all alike
to follow and obey it."

Due to Father's generous check, I was able to remain in America
after the congress was over. Four happy <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> were spent in humble
circumstances in Boston. I gave public lectures, taught classes,
and wrote a <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">book</span> of poems, SONGS OF THE SOUL, with a preface by
Dr. Frederick B. Robinson, president of the College of the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">City</span>
of New York. {FN37-5}

Starting a transcontinental tour in the summer of 1924, I spoke
before thousands in the principal cities, ending my western trip
with a vacation in the beautiful Alaskan north.

With the help of large-hearted students, by the end of 1925 I had
established an American headquarters on the Mount Washington Estates
in Los Angeles. The building is the one I had seen <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> before in
my vision at Kashmir. I hastened to send Sri Yukteswar pictures of
these distant American activities. He replied with a postcard in
Bengali, which I here translate:

11th August, 1926

Child of my heart, O Yogananda!

Seeing the photos of your school and students, what joy comes in
my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> I cannot express in words. I am melting in joy to see your
yoga students of different cities. Beholding your methods in chant

affirmations, healing vibrations, and <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> healing prayers, I
cannot refrain from thanking you from my heart. Seeing the gate,
the winding hilly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> upward, and the beautiful scenery spread out
beneath the Mount Washington Estates, I yearn to <span class="t0 t6 t7 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t17 t20 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">behold</span> it all with
my own eyes.

Everything here is going on well. Through the grace of God, may
you ever be in bliss.

addressed hundreds of clubs, colleges, churches, and groups of
every denomination. Tens of thousands of Americans received yoga
initiation. To them all I dedicated a new <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">book</span> of prayer thoughts
in 1929-WHISPERS FROM ETERNITY, with a preface by Amelita Galli-Curci.
{FN37-6} I give here, from the book, a poem entitled "God! God!
God!", composed one night as I stood on a lecture platform:

From the depths of slumber,
As I ascend the spiral stairway of wakefulness,
I whisper:
God! God! God!

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thou</span> <span class="t2 t6 t8 t9 t10 t15 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">art</span> the food, and when I break my fast

Of nightly separation from Thee,
I taste Thee, and mentally say:
God! God! God!

No <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> where I go, the spotlight of my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span>
Ever keeps turning on Thee;
And in the battle din of activity
My silent war cry is ever: God! God! God!

When boisterous storms of trials shriek,
And when worries howl at me,
I drown their clamor, loudly chanting:
God! God! God!

When my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> weaves dreams
With threads of memories,
Then on that magic cloth I <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> embossed:
God! God! God!

Every night, in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of deepest sleep,
My <span class="t13 hoverable">peace</span> dreams and calls, Joy! Joy! Joy!
And my joy comes singing evermore:
God! God! God!

In waking, eating, working, dreaming, sleeping,

Serving, meditating, chanting, divinely loving,
My <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> constantly hums, unheard by any:
God! God! God!

Sometimes-usually on the first of the month when the bills rolled
in for upkeep of the Mount Washington and other Self-Realization
Fellowship centers!-I <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> longingly of the simple <span class="t13 hoverable">peace</span> of
India. But daily I saw a widening understanding between West and
East; my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> rejoiced.

lines by Emma Lazarus, carved at the base of the Statue of Liberty,
the "Mother of Exiles":

From her beacon-hand
Glows world-wide welcome; her mild <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> command
The air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame.
"Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!" cries she
With silent lips. "Give me your tired, your poor,
Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,
The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.
Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me,
I lift my lamp beside the golden door.

CHAPTER: 38

LUTHER BURBANK--A SAINT AMIDST THE ROSES

"The secret of improved plant breeding, apart from scientific
knowledge, is love." Luther Burbank uttered this <span class="t12 t20 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">wisdom</span> as I walked
beside him in his Santa Rosa garden. We halted near a bed of edible
cacti.

"While I was conducting experiments to make 'spineless' cacti," he
continued, "I often talked to the plants to create a vibration of
love. 'You have nothing to fear,' I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> tell them. 'You don't need
your defensive thorns. I will protect you.' Gradually the useful
plant of the desert emerged in a thornless variety."

I was charmed at this miracle. "Please, dear Luther, give me a few
cacti leaves to plant in my garden at Mount Washington."

A workman standing near-by started to strip off some leaves; Burbank
prevented him.

"I myself will pluck them for the swami." He handed me <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> leaves,
which later I planted, rejoicing as they grew to huge estate.

The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> horticulturist told me that his first notable triumph was
the large potato, now known by his name. With the indefatigability
of genius, he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> on to present the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> with hundreds of crossed
improvements on nature-his new Burbank varieties of tomato, corn,

squash, cherries, plums, nectarines, berries, poppies, lilies,
roses.

I focused my camera as Luther led me before the famous walnut tree
by which he had proved that natural evolution can be telescopically
hastened.

"In only sixteen years," he said, "this walnut tree reached a <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span>
of abundant nut production to which an unaided <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have
<span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> the tree in twice that time."

[Illustration: Luther Burbank, beloved friend, poses with me in
his Santa Rosa garden.--see burbank.jpg]

[Illustration: Luther Burbank--see burbank2.jpg]

Burbank's little adopted daughter came romping with her dog into
the garden.

"She is my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> plant." Luther waved to her affectionately. "I see
humanity now as one vast plant, needing for its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> fulfillments
only love, the natural blessings of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> outdoors, and
intelligent crossing and selection. In the span of my own lifetime
I have observed such wondrous progress in plant evolution that I
look forward optimistically to a healthy, happy <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> as soon as its

children are taught the principles of simple and rational living.
We must return to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> and nature's God."

"Luther, you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> delight in my Ranchi school, with its outdoor
classes, and atmosphere of joy and simplicity."

My <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> touched the chord closest to Burbank's heart-child
education. He plied me with questions, interest gleaming from his
deep, serene eyes.

"Swamiji," he said finally, "schools like yours are the only hope
of a future millennium. I am in revolt against the educational systems
of our time, severed from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> and stifling of all individuality.
I am with you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> in your practical ideals of education."

As I was taking leave of the gentle sage, he autographed a small volume
and presented it to me. {FN38-1} "Here is my <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">book</span> on THE TRAINING
OF THE <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">HUMAN</span> PLANT," {FN38-2} he said. "New types of training are
needed-fearless experiments. At times the most daring trials have
succeeded in bringing out the best in fruits and flowers. Educational
innovations for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">children</span> should likewise become more numerous, more
courageous."

I read his little <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">book</span> that night with intense interest. His eye
envisioning a glorious future for the race, he wrote: "The most

stubborn living <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> in this world, the most difficult to swerve,
is a plant once fixed in certain habits. . . . Remember that this
plant has preserved its individuality all through the ages; perhaps
it is one which can be traced backward through eons of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> in the
very rocks themselves, never having varied to any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> extent in
all these vast periods. Do you suppose, after all these ages of
repetition, the plant does not become possessed of a will, if you
so choose to <span class="t3 t11 t18 t27 hoverable">call</span> it, of unparalleled tenacity? Indeed, there are
plants, like certain of the palms, so persistent that no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span>
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> has <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> been able to change them. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> will is a weak
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> beside the will of a plant. But see how this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> plant's
lifelong stubbornness is broken simply by blending a new <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> with
it, making, by crossing, a complete and powerful change in its life.
Then when the break comes, fix it by these generations of patient
supervision and selection, and the new plant sets out <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> its new

and changed at last.

"When it comes to so sensitive and pliable a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span>
of a child, the problem becomes vastly easier."

Magnetically drawn to this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> American, I visited him again and
again. One morning I arrived at the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> as the postman, who
deposited in Burbank's study about a <span class="t15 t23 hoverable">thousand</span> letters. Horticulturists
wrote him from all parts of the world.

"Swamiji, your presence is just the excuse I need to get out into
the garden," Luther said gaily. He opened a large desk-drawer
containing hundreds of travel folders.

"See," he said, "this is how I do my traveling. Tied down by my
plants and correspondence, I satisfy my <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> for foreign lands
by a glance now and then at these pictures."

My car was standing before his gate; Luther and I drove along the
streets of the little town, its gardens bright with his own varieties
of Santa Rosa, Peachblow, and Burbank roses.

"My friend Henry Ford and I both believe in the ancient theory of
reincarnation," Luther told me. "It sheds <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> on aspects of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span>
otherwise inexplicable. Memory is not a test of truth; just because
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> fails to remember his past lives does not prove he never had
them. Memory is blank concerning his womb-life and infancy, too;
but he probably passed through them!" He chuckled.

The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> scientist had received KRIYA initiation during one of my
earlier visits. "I practice the technique devoutly, Swamiji," he
said. After many thoughtful questions to me about various aspects
of yoga, Luther remarked slowly:

"The East indeed possesses immense hoards of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> which the
West has scarcely begun to explore."

Intimate communion with nature, who unlocked to him many of her
jealously guarded secrets, had given Burbank a boundless <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span>
reverence.

"Sometimes I feel very close to the Infinite Power," he confided
shyly. His sensitive, beautifully modeled face lit with his memories.
"Then I have been able to heal sick persons around me, as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as
many ailing plants."

He told me of his mother, a sincere Christian. "Many times after
her death," Luther said, "I have been <span class="t11 hoverable">blessed</span> by her appearance in
visions; she has spoken to me."

We drove back reluctantly toward his home and those waiting <span class="t15 t23 hoverable">thousand</span>
letters.

"Luther," I remarked, "next month I am starting a magazine to present
the truth-offerings of East and West. Please help me decide on a
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> name for the journal."

We discussed titles for awhile, and finally agreed on EAST-WEST.
After we had reentered his study, Burbank gave me an article he

had <span class="t0 t11 t24 hoverable">written</span> on "Science and Civilization."

"This will go in the first issue of EAST-WEST," I said gratefully.

As our friendship grew deeper, I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Burbank my "American saint."
"Behold a man," I quoted, "in whom there is no guile!" His <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span>
was fathomlessly deep, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> acquainted with humility, patience,
sacrifice. His little home amidst the roses was austerely simple;
he knew the worthlessness of luxury, the joy of few possessions. The
modesty with which he wore his scientific fame repeatedly reminded
me of the trees that bend low with the burden of ripening fruits;
it is the barren tree that lifts its <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> <span class="t23 hoverable">high</span> in an empty boast.

I was in New York when, in 1926, my dear friend passed away. In
tears I thought, "Oh, I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> gladly walk all the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> from here to
Santa Rosa for one more glimpse of him!" Locking myself away from
secretaries and visitors, I spent the next twenty-four hours in
seclusion.

The following <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> I conducted a Vedic memorial rite around a large
picture of Luther. A group of my American students, garbed in Hindu
ceremonial clothes, chanted the ancient hymns as an <span class="t22 t23 t28 hoverable">offering</span> was
made of flowers, water, and fire-symbols of the bodily elements
and their release in the Infinite Source.

Though the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of Burbank lies in Santa Rosa under a Lebanon cedar
that he planted <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> ago in his garden, his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> is enshrined for
me in every wide-eyed flower that blooms by the wayside. Withdrawn
for a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> into the spacious <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> of nature, is that not Luther
whispering in her winds, walking her dawns?

His name has now passed into the heritage of common speech. Listing
"burbank" as a transitive verb, Webster's New International Dictionary
defines it: "To cross or graft (a plant). Hence, figuratively, to
improve (anything, as a process or institution) by selecting <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span>
features and rejecting bad, or by adding <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> features."

"Beloved Burbank," I cried after reading the definition, "your very
name is now a synonym for goodness!"

LUTHER BURBANK

SANTA ROSA, CALIFORNIA

U.S.A.

December 22, 1924

I have examined the Yogoda system of Swami Yogananda and in my
opinion it is ideal for training and harmonizing man's physical,

mental, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> natures. Swami's aim is to establish
"How-to-Live" schools throughout the world, wherein education will
not confine itself to intellectual development alone, but also
training of the body, will, and feelings.

Through the Yogoda system of physical, mental, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span>
unfoldment by simple and scientific methods of concentration and
meditation, most of the complex problems of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> may be solved,
and <span class="t13 hoverable">peace</span> and good-will come <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> earth. The Swami's idea of
right education is plain commonsense, <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> from all mysticism and
non-praciticality; otherwise it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> not have my approval.

I am glad to have this opportunity of heartily joining with the
Swami in his appeal for international schools on the <span class="t2 t6 t8 t9 t10 t15 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">art</span> of living
which, if established, will come as near to bringing the millennium
as anything with which I am acquainted.

{FN38-1} Burbank also gave me an autographed picture of himself.
I treasure it even as a Hindu merchant once treasured a picture of
Lincoln. The Hindu, who was in America during the Civil War years,
conceived such an admiration for Lincoln that he was unwilling
to return to India until he had obtained a portrait of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Great</span>
Emancipator. Planting himself adamantly on Lincoln's doorstep, the
merchant refused to leave until the astonished President permitted
him to engage the services of Daniel Huntington, the famous New

York artist. When the portrait was finished, the Hindu carried it
in triumph to Calcutta.

CHAPTER: 39

THERESE NEUMANN, THE CATHOLIC STIGMATIST

"Return to india. I have waited for you patiently for fifteen
years. Soon I shall swim out of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> and on to the Shining
Abode. Yogananda, come!"

Sri Yukteswar's <span class="t23 hoverable">voice</span> sounded startlingly in my inner ear as I sat
in <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> at my Mt. Washington headquarters. Traversing ten
<span class="t15 t23 hoverable">thousand</span> miles in the twinkling of an eye, his message penetrated
my being like a flash of lightning.

Fifteen years! Yes, I realized, now it is 1935; I have spent fifteen
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> in spreading my guru's teachings in America. Now he recalls
me.

That afternoon I recounted my experience to a visiting disciple.
His <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> development under KRIYA YOGA was so remarkable that
I often <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> him "saint," remembering Babaji's prophecy that America
too <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> produce <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> and women of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> realization through the
ancient yogic path.

This disciple and a <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> of others generously insisted on making a
donation for my travels. The financial problem <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> solved, I made
arrangements to sail, via Europe, for India. Busy weeks of preparations
at Mount Washington! In March, 1935 I had the Self-Realization
Fellowship chartered under the laws of the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">State</span> of California as
a non-profit corporation. To this educational institution go all
public donations as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as the revenue from the sale of my books,
magazine, <span class="t0 t11 t24 hoverable">written</span> courses, class tuition, and every other source
of income.

"I shall be back," I told my students. "Never shall I forget
America."

At a farewell banquet given to me in Los Angeles by loving friends,
I looked <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> at their faces and <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> gratefully, "Lord, he who
remembers <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thee</span> as the Sole Giver will never lack the sweetness of
friendship among mortals."

I sailed from New York on June 9, 1935 {FN39-1} in the EUROPA. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Two</span>
students accompanied me: my secretary, Mr. C. Richard Wright, and
an elderly lady from Cincinnati, Miss Ettie Bletch. We enjoyed the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">days</span> of ocean peace, a welcome contrast to the past hurried weeks.
Our period of leisure was short-lived; the speed of modern boats
has some regrettable features!

Like any other group of inquisitive tourists, we walked around the
huge and ancient <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">city</span> of London. The following <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> I was invited to
address a large meeting in Caxton Hall, at which I was introduced
to the London audience by Sir Francis Younghusband. Our party
spent a pleasant <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> as guests of Sir Harry Lauder at his estate
in Scotland. We soon crossed the English Channel to the continent,
for I wanted to make a special pilgrimage to Bavaria. This <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span>
be my only chance, I felt, to visit the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Catholic mystic,
Therese Neumann of Konnersreuth.

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Years</span> earlier I had read an amazing <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of Therese. Information
given in the article was as follows:

(1) Therese, <span class="t16 t24 hoverable">born</span> in 1898, had been injured in an accident at the
age of twenty; she became blind and paralyzed.

(2) She miraculously regained her sight in 1923 through prayers
to St. Teresa, "The Little Flower." Later Therese Neumann's limbs

were instantaneously healed.

(3) From 1923 onward, Therese has abstained completely from <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span>
and drink, except for the daily swallowing of one small consecrated
wafer.

(4) The stigmata, or sacred wounds of Christ, appeared in 1926 on
Therese's head, breast, hands, and feet. On Friday of every week
thereafter, she has passed through the Passion of Christ, suffering
in her own <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> all his historic agonies.

(5) Knowing ordinarily only the simple German of her village,
during her Friday trances Therese utters phrases which scholars
have identified as ancient Aramaic. At appropriate times in her
vision, she speaks Hebrew or Greek.

(6) By ecclesiastical permission, Therese has several times been
under close scientific observation. Dr. Fritz Gerlick, editor of
a Protestant German newspaper, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> to Konnersreuth to "expose the
Catholic fraud," but ended up by reverently writing her biography.
{FN39-2}

As always, <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> in East or West, I was eager to meet a saint.
I rejoiced as our little party entered, on July 16th, the quaint
village of Konnersreuth. The Bavarian peasants exhibited lively

interest in our Ford automobile (brought with us from America) and
its assorted group-an American young man, an elderly lady, and an
olive-hued Oriental with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> hair tucked under his coat collar.

Therese's little cottage, clean and neat, with geraniums blooming
by a primitive well, was alas! silently closed. The neighbors, and
even the village postman who passed by, could give us no information.
Rain began to fall; my companions suggested that we leave.

"No," I said stubbornly, "I will stay here until I <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> some clue
leading to Therese."

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Two</span> hours later we were still sitting in our car amidst the dismal
rain. "Lord," I sighed complainingly, "why didst <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thou</span> lead me here
if she has disappeared?"

An English-speaking <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> halted beside us, politely <span class="t22 t23 t28 hoverable">offering</span> his
aid.

"I don't know for certain where Therese is," he said, "but she
often visits at the home of Professor Wurz, a seminary <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> of
Eichstatt, eighty miles from here."

The following morning our party motored to the quiet village
of Eichstatt, narrowly lined with cobblestoned streets. Dr. Wurz

greeted us cordially at his home; "Yes, Therese is here." He sent
her <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> of the visitors. A messenger soon appeared with her reply.

"Though the bishop has asked me to see no one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> his permission,
I will receive the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> from India."

Deeply touched at these words, I followed Dr. Wurz upstairs to the
sitting room. Therese entered immediately, radiating an aura of
<span class="t13 hoverable">peace</span> and joy. She wore a black gown and spotless white <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> dress.
Although her age was thirty-seven at this time, she seemed much
younger, possessing indeed a childlike freshness and charm. Healthy,
well-formed, rosy-cheeked, and cheerful, this is the saint that
does not eat!

Therese greeted me with a very gentle handshaking. We both beamed
in silent communion, each knowing the other to be a lover of God.

Dr. Wurz kindly offered to serve as interpreter. As we seated
ourselves, I noticed that Therese was glancing at me with naive
curiosity; evidently Hindus had been rare in Bavaria.

"Don't you <span class="t28 hoverable">eat</span> anything?" I wanted to hear the answer from her own
lips.

"No, except a consecrated rice-flour wafer, once every morning at

six o'clock."

"How large is the wafer?"

"It is paper-thin, the size of a small coin." She added, "I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span>
it for sacramental reasons; if it is unconsecrated, I am unable to
swallow it."

"Certainly you could not have lived on that, for twelve <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span>
years?"

"I live by God's light." How simple her reply, how Einsteinian!

"I see you realize that energy flows to your <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> from the ether,
sun, and air."

A swift smile broke over her face. "I am so happy to know you
understand how I live."

"Your sacred <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> is a daily demonstration of the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> uttered by
Christ: 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> that
proceedeth out of the mouth of God.'" {FN39-3}

Again she showed joy at my explanation. "It is indeed so. One of
the reasons I am here on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> today is to prove that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> can live

by God's invisible light, and not by <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> only."

"Can you teach others how to live <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> food?"

She appeared a trifle shocked. "I cannot do that; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> does not wish
it."

As my gaze fell on her strong, graceful hands, Therese showed me
a little, square, freshly healed wound on each of her palms. On
the back of each hand, she pointed out a smaller, crescent-shaped
wound, freshly healed. Each wound <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> straight through the hand.
The sight <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> to my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> distinct recollection of the large
square iron nails with crescent-tipped ends, still <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> in the
Orient, but which I do not recall having seen in the West.

The saint told me something of her weekly trances. "As a helpless
onlooker, I observe the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> Passion of Christ." Each week, from
Thursday midnight until Friday afternoon at one o'clock, her wounds
open and bleed; she loses ten pounds of her ordinary 121-pound
weight. Suffering intensely in her sympathetic love, Therese <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span>
looks forward joyously to these weekly visions of her Lord.

I realized at once that her strange <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> is intended by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> to reassure
all Christians of the historical authenticity of Jesus' <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> and
crucifixion as recorded in the New Testament, and to dramatically

display the ever-living bond between the Galilean <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> and his
devotees.

Professor Wurz related some of his experiences with the saint.

"Several of us, including Therese, often travel for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">days</span> on
sight-seeing trips throughout Germany," he told me. "It is a striking
contrast-while we have <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> meals a day, Therese eats nothing.
She remains as fresh as a rose, untouched by the fatigue which the
trips cause us. As we grow hungry and hunt for wayside inns, she
laughs merrily."

The professor added some interesting physiological details: "Because
Therese takes no food, her stomach has shrunk. She has no excretions,
but her perspiration glands function; her skin is always soft and
firm."

At the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of parting, I expressed to Therese my <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> to be
present at her trance.

"Yes, please come to Konnersreuth next Friday," she said graciously.
"The bishop will give you a permit. I am very happy you sought me
out in Eichstatt."

Therese shook <span class="t13 t23 hoverable">hands</span> gently, many times, and walked with our party

to the gate. Mr. Wright turned on the automobile radio; the saint
examined it with little enthusiastic chuckles. Such a large crowd
of youngsters gathered that Therese retreated into the house. We
saw her at a window, where she peered at us, childlike, waving her
hand.

From a conversation the next <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> of Therese's brothers,
very kind and amiable, we learned that the saint sleeps only one
or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> hours at night. In spite of the many wounds in her body,
she is active and <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span> of energy. She loves birds, looks after an
aquarium of fish, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> often in her garden. Her correspondence
is large; Catholic devotees write her for prayers and healing
blessings. Many seekers have been cured through her of serious
diseases.

Her brother Ferdinand, about twenty-three, explained that Therese
has the power, through prayer, of working out on her own <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> the
ailments of others. The saint's abstinence from <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> dates from a
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> when she prayed that the throat disease of a young <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> of her
parish, then preparing to enter <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">holy</span> orders, be transferred to her
own throat.

On Thursday afternoon our party drove to the home of the bishop,
who looked at my flowing locks with some surprise. He readily
wrote out the necessary permit. There was no fee; the rule made by

the Church is simply to protect Therese from the onrush of casual
tourists, who in previous <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> had flocked on Fridays by the
thousands.

We arrived Friday morning about nine-thirty in Konnersreuth. I
noticed that Therese's little cottage possesses a special glass-roofed
section to afford her plenty of light. We were glad to see the
doors no longer closed, but wide-open in hospitable cheer. There
was a line of about twenty visitors, armed with their permits. Many
had come from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> distances to <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> the mystic trance.

Therese had passed my first test at the professor's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> by her
intuitive <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> that I wanted to see her for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> reasons,
and not just to satisfy a passing curiosity.

My <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> test was connected with the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that, just before I
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> upstairs to her room, I put myself into a yogic trance <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span>
in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> to be one with her in telepathic and televisic rapport. I
entered her chamber, filled with visitors; she was lying in a white
robe on the bed. With Mr. Wright following closely behind me, I
halted just inside the threshold, awestruck at a strange and most
frightful spectacle.

[Illustration: THERESE NEUMANN, Famous Catholic Stigmatist who
inspired my 1935 pilgrimage to Konnersreuth, Bavaria--see neumann.jpg]

Blood flowed thinly and continuously in an inch-wide stream from
Therese's lower eyelids. Her gaze was focused upward on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span>
eye <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the central forehead. The cloth wrapped around her <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span>
was drenched in blood from the stigmata wounds of the crown of
thorns. The white garment was redly splotched over her <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> from
the wound in her <span class="t6 hoverable">side</span> at the spot where Christ's body, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> ages
ago, had suffered the final indignity of the soldier's spear-thrust.

Therese's <span class="t13 t23 hoverable">hands</span> were extended in a gesture maternal, pleading;
her face wore an expression both tortured and divine. She appeared
thinner, changed in many subtle as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as outward ways. Murmuring
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> in a foreign tongue, she spoke with slightly quivering lips
to persons visible before her inner sight.

As I was in attunement with her, I began to see the scenes of
her vision. She was watching <span class="t0 t6 t8 t9 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t22 t23 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Jesus</span> as he carried the cross amidst
the jeering multitude. {FN39-4} Suddenly she lifted her <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span>
in consternation: the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> had fallen under the cruel weight. The
vision disappeared. In the exhaustion of fervid pity, Therese sank
heavily against her pillow.

At this moment I <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> a loud thud behind me. Turning my <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> for
a second, I saw <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> carrying out a prostrate body. But because
I was coming out of the deep superconscious state, I did not

immediately recognize the fallen person. Again I fixed my <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> on
Therese's face, deathly pale under the rivulets of blood, but now
calm, radiating purity and holiness. I glanced behind me later
and saw Mr. Wright standing with his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> against his cheek, from
which blood was trickling.

"Dick," I inquired anxiously, "were you the one who fell?"

"Yes, I fainted at the terrifying spectacle."

"Well," I said consolingly, "you are brave to return and look <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span>
the sight again."

Remembering the patiently waiting line of pilgrims, Mr. Wright and
I silently bade farewell to Therese and <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> her sacred presence.

were not dependent on trains, but could stop the Ford wherever we
chose throughout the countryside. We enjoyed every minute of a tour
through Germany, Holland, France, and the Swiss Alps. In Italy we
made a special trip to Assisi to honor the apostle of humility, St.
Francis. The European tour ended in Greece, where we viewed the
Athenian temples, and saw the prison in which the gentle Socrates
{FN39-6} had drunk his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">death</span> potion. One is filled with admiration

their very fancies in alabaster.

Last Supper. Antiquity unfolded; scene by scene, I saw the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span>

{FN39-4} During the hours preceding my arrival, Therese had already
passed through many visions of the closing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">days</span> in Christ's life.
Her entrancement usually starts with scenes of the events which
followed the Last Supper. Her visions end with Jesus' <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">death</span> on the

Socrates. At this the Indian burst out laughing. 'How can a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span>

and a noted writer on harmonics. His date is 330 B.C.

CHAPTER: 40

I RETURN TO INDIA

Gratefully I was inhaling the <span class="t11 hoverable">blessed</span> air of India. Our boat
RAJPUTANA docked on August 22, 1935 in the huge harbor of Bombay.
Even this, my first <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> off the ship, was a foretaste of the year
ahead-twelve months of ceaseless activity. Friends had gathered
at the dock with garlands and greetings; soon, at our suite in the
Taj Mahal Hotel, there was a stream of reporters and photographers.

Bombay was a <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">city</span> new to me; I found it energetically modern, with
many innovations from the West. Palms line the spacious boulevards;
magnificent <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> structures vie for interest with ancient temples.
Very little <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> was given to sight-seeing, however; I was impatient,
eager to see my beloved guru and other dear ones. Consigning the
Ford to a baggage car, our party was soon speeding eastward by
train toward Calcutta. {FN40-1}

Our arrival at Howrah Station found such an immense crowd assembled
to greet us that for awhile we were unable to dismount from the
train. The young Maharaja of Kasimbazar and my brother Bishnu
headed the reception committee; I was unprepared for the warmth
and magnitude of our welcome.

Preceded by a line of automobiles and motorcycles, and amidst the
joyous sound of drums and conch shells, Miss Bletch, Mr. Wright,
and myself, flower-garlanded from <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> to foot, drove slowly to my
father's home.

My aged parent embraced me as one returning from the dead; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span>
we gazed on each other, speechless with joy. Brothers and sisters,
uncles, aunts, and cousins, students and friends of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> past
were grouped around me, not a dry eye among us. Passed now into the
archives of memory, the scene of loving reunion vividly endures,

unforgettable in my heart.

As for my meeting with Sri Yukteswar, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> fail me; let the
following description from my secretary suffice.

"Today, filled with the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> anticipations, I drove Yoganandaji
from Calcutta to Serampore," Mr. Wright recorded in his travel diary.
"We passed by quaint shops, one of them the favorite eating haunt
of Yoganandaji during his college days, and finally entered a narrow,
walled lane. A sudden <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> turn, and there before us towered the
simple but inspiring two-story ashram, its Spanish-style balcony
jutting from the upper floor. The pervasive impression was that of
peaceful solitude.

"In grave humility I walked behind Yoganandaji into the courtyard
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the hermitage walls. Hearts beating fast, we proceeded up
some old cement steps, trod, no doubt, by myriads of truth-seekers.
The tension grew keener and keener as on we strode. Before us, near
the <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> of the stairs, quietly appeared the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Great</span> One, Swami Sri
Yukteswarji, standing in the noble pose of a sage.

"My <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> heaved and swelled as I felt myself <span class="t11 hoverable">blessed</span> by the
privilege of being in his sublime presence. Tears blurred my eager
sight when Yoganandaji dropped to his knees, and with bowed <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span>
offered his soul's gratitude and greeting, touching with his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span>

his guru's feet and then, in humble obeisance, his own head. He rose
then and was embraced on both sides of the bosom by Sri Yukteswarji.

"No <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> passed at the beginning, but the most intense feeling was
expressed in the mute phrases of the soul. How their <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> sparkled
and were fired with the warmth of renewed soul-union! A tender
vibration surged through the quiet patio, and even the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> eluded
the clouds to add a sudden blaze of glory.

"On bended knee before the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> I gave my own unexpressed <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t8 t13 t15 t17 t18 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span>
and thanks, touching his feet, calloused by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> and service,
and receiving his blessing. I stood then and faced <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> beautiful
deep <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> smouldering with introspection, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> radiant with joy.
We entered his sitting room, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> <span class="t6 hoverable">side</span> opened to the outer
balcony first seen from the street. The <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> braced himself
against a worn davenport, sitting on a covered mattress on the
cement floor. Yoganandaji and I sat near the guru's feet, with
orange-colored pillows to lean against and ease our positions on
the straw mat.

"I tried and tried to penetrate the Bengali conversation between
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> Swamijis-for English, I discovered, is null and void when

the saintliness of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Great</span> One through his heart-warming smile

and twinkling eyes. One quality easily discernible in his merry,
serious conversation is a decided positiveness in statement-the
mark of a <span class="t8 t12 t17 hoverable">wise</span> man, who knows he knows, because he knows God. His
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> wisdom, strength of purpose, and determination are apparent
in every way.

"Studying him reverently from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> to time, I noted that he is of
large, athletic stature, hardened by the trials and sacrifices of
renunciation. His poise is majestic. A decidedly sloping forehead,
as if seeking the heavens, dominates his <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> countenance. He
has a rather large and homely nose, with which he amuses himself
in idle moments, flipping and wiggling it with his fingers, like a
child. His powerful dark <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> are haloed by an ethereal blue ring.
His hair, parted in the middle, begins as silver and changes to
streaks of silvery-gold and silvery-black, ending in ringlets at
his shoulders. His beard and moustache are scant or thinned out,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> seem to enhance his features and, like his character, are deep
and <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> at the same time.

"He has a jovial and rollicking laugh which comes from deep in his
chest, causing him to shake and quiver throughout his body-very
cheerful and sincere. His face and stature are striking in their
power, as are his muscular fingers. He moves with a dignified tread
and erect posture.

"He was clad simply in the common DHOTI and shirt, both once dyed
a strong ocher color, but now a faded orange.

"Glancing about, I observed that this rather dilapidated room suggested
the owner's non-attachment to material comforts. The weather-stained
white walls of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> chamber were streaked with fading blue
plaster. At one end of the room hung a picture of Lahiri Mahasaya,
garlanded in simple devotion. There was also an old picture showing
Yoganandaji as he had first arrived in Boston, standing with the
other delegates to the Congress of Religions.

"I noted a quaint concurrence of modernity and antiquation. A
huge, cut-glass, candle-light chandelier was covered with cobwebs
through disuse, and on the wall was a bright, up-to-date calendar.
The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> room emanated a fragrance of <span class="t13 hoverable">peace</span> and calmness. Beyond
the balcony I could see coconut trees towering over the hermitage
in silent protection.

"It is interesting to observe that the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> has merely to clap
his <span class="t13 t23 hoverable">hands</span> <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> and, before finishing, he is served or attended
by some small disciple. Incidentally, I am much attracted to one
of them-a thin lad, named Prafulla, {FN40-2} with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> black hair
to his shoulders, a most penetrating pair of sparkling black eyes,
and a heavenly smile; his <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> twinkle, as the corners of his mouth
rise, like the stars and the crescent moon appearing at twilight.

"Swami Sri Yukteswarji's joy is obviously intense at the return of
his 'product' (and he seems to be somewhat inquisitive about the
'product's product'). However, predominance of the wisdom-aspect
in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Great</span> One's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> hinders his outward expression of feeling.

"Yoganandaji presented him with some gifts, as is the custom when
the disciple returns to his guru. We sat down later to a simple
but well-cooked meal. All the dishes were vegetable and rice
combinations. Sri Yukteswarji was pleased at my <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> of a <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> of
Indian customs, 'finger-eating' for example.

"After several hours of flying Bengali phrases and the exchange
of warm smiles and joyful glances, we paid obeisance at his feet,
bade adieu with a PRONAM, {FN40-3} and departed for Calcutta with
an everlasting memory of a sacred meeting and greeting. Although I
write chiefly of my external impressions of him, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> I was always
conscious of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> basis of the saint-his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> glory. I
felt his power, and shall carry that feeling as my <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> blessing."

From America, Europe, and Palestine I had <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> many presents
for Sri Yukteswar. He received them smilingly, but <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> remark.
For my own use, I had bought in Germany a combination umbrella-cane.
In India I decided to give the cane to Master.

"This gift I appreciate indeed!" My guru's <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> were turned on me
with affectionate understanding as he made the unwonted comment.
From all the presents, it was the cane that he singled out to
display to visitors.

"Master, please permit me to get a new carpet for the sitting room."
I had noticed that Sri Yukteswar's tiger skin was placed over a
torn rug.

"Do so if it pleases you." My guru's <span class="t23 hoverable">voice</span> was not enthusiastic.
"Behold, my tiger mat is nice and clean; I am monarch in my own
little kingdom. Beyond it is the vast world, interested only in
externals."

As he uttered these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> I felt the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> roll back; once again
I am a young disciple, purified in the daily fires of chastisement!

As soon as I could tear myself away from Serampore and Calcutta,
I <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> out, with Mr. Wright, for Ranchi. What a welcome there, a
veritable ovation! Tears stood in my <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> as I embraced the selfless
teachers who had kept the banner of the school flying during my
fifteen years' absence. The bright faces and happy smiles of the
residential and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> students were ample testimony to the worth of
their many-sided school and yoga training.

Yet, alas! the Ranchi institution was in dire financial difficulties.
Sir Manindra Chandra Nundy, the old Maharaja <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> Kasimbazar Palace
had been converted into the central school building, and who had
made many princely donations was now dead. Many free, benevolent
features of the school were now seriously endangered for lack of
sufficient public support.

I had not spent <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> in America <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> learning some of its
practical wisdom, its undaunted <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> before obstacles. For one
week I remained in Ranchi, wrestling with critical problems. Then
came interviews in Calcutta with prominent leaders and educators,
a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> talk with the young Maharaja of Kasimbazar, a financial
appeal to my father, and lo! the shaky foundations of Ranchi began
to be righted. Many donations including one huge check arrived in
the nick of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> from my American students.

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">Within</span> a few months after my arrival in India, I had the joy of
seeing the Ranchi school legally incorporated. My lifelong dream
of a permanently endowed yoga educational center stood fulfilled.
That vision had guided me in the humble beginnings in 1917 with a
group of seven boys.

In the decade since 1935, Ranchi has enlarged its scope far beyond
the boys' school. Widespread humanitarian activities are now carried
on there in the Shyama Charan Lahiri Mahasaya Mission.

The school, or Yogoda Sat-Sanga Brahmacharya Vidyalaya, conducts
outdoor classes in grammar and <span class="t23 hoverable">high</span> school subjects. The residential
students and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> scholars also receive vocational training of some
kind. The boys themselves regulate most of their activities through
autonomous committees. Very early in my career as an educator I
discovered that boys who impishly delight in outwitting a teacher
will cheerfully accept disciplinary rules that are <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> by their
fellow students. Never a model pupil myself, I had a ready sympathy
for all boyish pranks and problems.

Sports and games are encouraged; the fields resound with hockey and
football practice. Ranchi students often win the cup at competitive
events. The outdoor gymnasium is known far and wide. Muscle recharging
through will <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> is the YOGODA feature: mental direction of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span>
energy to any part of the body. The boys are also taught ASANAS
(postures), sword and LATHI (stick) play, and jujitsu. The Yogoda
Health Exhibitions at the Ranchi VIDYALAYA have been attended by
thousands.

Instruction in primary subjects is given in Hindi to the KOLS,
SANTALS, and MUNDAS, aboriginal tribes of the province. Classes
for girls only have been organized in near-by villages.

The unique feature at Ranchi is the initiation into KRIYA YOGA.

The boys daily practice their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> exercises, engage in GITA
chanting, and are taught by precept and example the virtues of
simplicity, self-sacrifice, honor, and truth. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Evil</span> is pointed out
to them as being that which produces misery; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> as those actions
which result in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> happiness. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Evil</span> may be compared to poisoned
honey, tempting but laden with death.

Overcoming restlessness of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> by concentration techniques
has achieved astonishing results: it is no novelty at Ranchi to
see an appealing little figure, aged nine or ten years, sitting for
an hour or more in unbroken poise, the unwinking gaze directed to
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> eye. Often the picture of these Ranchi students has
returned to my mind, as I observed collegians over the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> who
are hardly able to sit still through one class period. {FN40-4}

Ranchi lies 2000 feet above sea level; the climate is mild and
equable. The twenty-five acre site, by a large bathing pond, includes
one of the finest orchards in India-five hundred fruit trees-mango,
guava, litchi, jackfruit, date. The boys grow their own vegetables,
and spin at their CHARKAS.

A guest <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> is hospitably open for Western visitors. The Ranchi
library contains numerous magazines, and about a <span class="t15 t23 hoverable">thousand</span> volumes
in English and Bengali, donations from the West and the East. There
is a collection of the scriptures of the world. A well-classified

museum displays archeological, geological, and anthropological
exhibits; trophies, to a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> extent, of my wanderings over the
Lord's varied earth.

The charitable hospital and dispensary of the Lahiri Mahasaya
Mission, with many outdoor branches in distant villages, have
already ministered to 150,000 of India's poor. The Ranchi students
are trained in first aid, and have given praiseworthy service to
their province at tragic times of flood or famine.

In the orchard stands a Shiva temple, with a statue of the <span class="t11 hoverable">blessed</span>
master, Lahiri Mahasaya. Daily prayers and scripture classes are
held in the garden under the mango bowers.

Branch <span class="t23 hoverable">high</span> schools, with the residential and yoga features of Ranchi,
have been opened and are now flourishing. These are the Yogoda
Sat-Sanga Vidyapith (School) for Boys, at Lakshmanpur in Bihar;
and the Yogoda Sat-Sanga <span class="t23 hoverable">High</span> School and hermitage at Ejmalichak
in Midnapore.

A stately Yogoda Math was dedicated in 1939 at Dakshineswar,
directly on the Ganges. Only a few miles north of Calcutta, the
new hermitage affords a haven of <span class="t13 hoverable">peace</span> for <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">city</span> dwellers. Suitable
accommodations are available for Western guests, and particularly
for those seekers who are intensely dedicating their lives to

spiritual realization. The activities of the Yogoda Math include
a fortnightly mailing of Self-Realization Fellowship teachings to
students in various parts of India.

It is needless to say that all these educational and humanitarian
activities have required the self-sacrificing service and devotion
of many teachers and workers. I do not list their names here,
because they are so numerous; but in my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> each one has a lustrous
niche. Inspired by the ideals of Lahiri Mahasaya, these teachers
have abandoned promising worldly goals to serve humbly, to give
greatly.

Mr. Wright formed many fast friendships with Ranchi boys; clad in
a simple DHOTI, he lived for awhile among them. At Ranchi, Calcutta,
Serampore, everywhere he went, my secretary, who has a vivid gift
of description, hauled out his travel diary to record his adventures.
One evening I asked him a question.

"Dick, what is your impression of India?"

"Peace," he said thoughtfully. "The racial aura is peace."

{FN40-1} We broke our journey in Central Provinces, halfway across
the continent, to see Mahatma Gandhi at Wardha. Those <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">days</span> are

{FN40-2} Prafulla was the lad who had been present with <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> when
a cobra approached (see page 116).

{FN40-3} Literally, "holy name," a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> of greeting among Hindus,
accompanied by palm-folded <span class="t13 t23 hoverable">hands</span> lifted from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> to the
forehead in salutation. A PRONAM in India takes the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> of the
Western greeting by handshaking.

{FN40-4} Mental training through certain concentration techniques
has produced in each Indian generation <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> of prodigious memory.
Sir T. Vijayaraghavachari, in the HINDUSTAN TIMES, has described
the tests put to the modern professional "memory men" of Madras.
"These men," he wrote, "were unusually learned in Sanskrit literature.
Seated in the midst of a large audience, they were equal to the
tests that several members of the audience simultaneously put them
to.

of revolutions of which had to be counted. The memory expert had
simultaneously to do all these feats purely by mental processes,
as he was allowed no paper and pencil. The strain on the faculties
must have been terrific. Ordinarily <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> in unconscious envy are
apt to depreciate such efforts by affecting to believe that they
involve only the exercise of the lower functionings of the brain.
It is not, however, a pure question of memory. The greater factor
is the immense concentration of mind."

CHAPTER: 41

AN IDYL IN SOUTH INDIA

"You are the first Westerner, Dick, ever to enter that shrine. Many
others have tried in vain."

At my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> Mr. Wright looked startled, then pleased. We had just
<span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> the beautiful Chamundi Temple in the hills overlooking Mysore
in southern India. There we had bowed before the gold and silver
altars of the Goddess Chamundi, patron deity of the family of the

reigning maharaja.

"As a souvenir of the unique honor," Mr. Wright said, carefully
stowing away a few <span class="t11 hoverable">blessed</span> rose petals, "I will always preserve
this flower, sprinkled by the priest with rose water."

My companion and I {FN41-1} were spending the month of November,
1935, as guests of the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">State</span> of Mysore. The Maharaja, H.H.
Sri Krishnaraja Wadiyar IV, is a model prince with intelligent
devotion to his people. A pious Hindu, the Maharaja has empowered
a Mohammedan, the able Mirza Ismail, as his Dewan or Premier.
Popular representation is given to the seven million inhabitants
of Mysore in both an Assembly and a Legislative Council.

The heir to the Maharaja, H.H. the Yuvaraja, Sir Sri Krishna
Narasingharaj Wadiyar, had invited my secretary and me to visit
his enlightened and progressive realm. During the past fortnight
I had addressed thousands of Mysore citizens and students, at the
Town Hall, the Maharajah's College, the University Medical School;
and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> mass meetings in Bangalore, at the National <span class="t23 hoverable">High</span> School,
the Intermediate College, and the Chetty Town Hall where over
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> <span class="t15 t23 hoverable">thousand</span> persons had assembled. <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">Whether</span> the eager listeners
had been able to credit the glowing picture I drew of America,
I know not; but the applause had always been loudest when I spoke
of the mutual benefits that could flow from exchange of the best

features in East and West.

Mr. Wright and I were now relaxing in the tropical peace. His travel
diary gives the following <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of his impressions of Mysore:

"Brilliantly green rice fields, varied by tasseled sugar cane
patches, nestle at the protective foot of rocky hills-hills dotting
the emerald panorama like excrescences of black stone-and the play
of colors is enhanced by the sudden and dramatic disappearance of
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> as it seeks rest behind the solemn hills.

"Many rapturous moments have been spent in gazing, almost absent-mindedly,
at the ever-changing canvas of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> stretched across the firmament,
for His touch alone is able to produce colors that vibrate with the
freshness of life. That youth of colors is lost when <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> tries to
imitate with mere pigments, for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> resorts to a more simple
and effective medium-oils that are neither oils nor pigments, but
mere rays of light. He tosses a splash of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> here, and it reflects
red; He waves the brush again and it blends gradually into orange
and gold; then with a piercing thrust He stabs the clouds with a
streak of purple that leaves a ringlet or fringe of red oozing out
of the wound in the clouds; and so, on and on, He plays, night and
morning alike, ever-changing, ever-new, ever-fresh; no patterns,
no duplicates, no colors just the same. The beauty of the Indian
change in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> to night is beyond compare elsewhere; often the sky

looks as if <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> had <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> all the colors in His kit and given them
one mighty kaleidoscopic toss into the heavens.

"I must relate the splendor of a twilight visit to the huge
Krishnaraja Sagar Dam, {FN41-2} constructed twelve miles outside
of Mysore. Yoganandaji and I boarded a small bus and, with a small
boy as official cranker or battery substitute, started off over a
smooth dirt road, just as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> was setting on the horizon and
squashing like an overripe tomato.

"Our journey led past the omnipresent square rice fields, through
a line of comforting banyan trees, in between a grove of towering
coconut palms, with vegetation nearly as thick as in a jungle,
and finally, approaching the crest of a hill, we came face-to-face
with an immense artificial lake, reflecting the stars and fringe
of palms and other trees, surrounded by lovely terraced gardens
and a row of electric lights on the brink of the dam-and below
it our <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> met a dazzling spectacle of colored beams playing on
geyserlike fountains, like so many streams of brilliant ink pouring
forth-gorgeously blue waterfalls, arresting red cataracts, green
and yellow sprays, elephants spouting water, a miniature of the
Chicago World's Fair, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> modernly outstanding in this ancient
<span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">land</span> of paddy fields and simple people, who have given us such a
loving welcome that I <span class="t28 hoverable">fear</span> it will <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> more than my strength to
<span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> Yoganandaji back to America.

"Another rare privilege-my first elephant ride. Yesterday the
Yuvaraja invited us to his summer palace to enjoy a ride on one of
his elephants, an enormous beast. I mounted a ladder provided to
climb aloft to the HOWDAH or saddle, which is silk-cushioned and
boxlike; and then for a rolling, tossing, swaying, and heaving down
into a gully, too much thrilled to worry or exclaim, but hanging
on for dear life!"

Southern India, rich with historical and archaeological remains,
is a <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">land</span> of definite and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> indefinable charm. To the north of
Mysore is the largest native <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> in India, Hyderabad, a picturesque
plateau cut by the mighty Godavari River. Broad fertile plains,
the lovely Nilgiris or "Blue Mountains," other regions with barren
hills of limestone or granite. Hyderabad history is a long, colorful
story, starting <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> <span class="t15 t23 hoverable">thousand</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> ago under the Andhra kings,
and continuing under Hindu dynasties until A.D. 1294, when it passed
to a line of Moslem rulers who reign to this day.

The most breath-taking display of architecture, sculpture, and painting
in all India is found at Hyderabad in the ancient rock-sculptured
caves of Ellora and Ajanta. The Kailasa at Ellora, a huge monolithic
temple, possesses carved figures of gods, men, and beasts in the
stupendous proportions of a Michelangelo. Ajanta is the site of
five cathedrals and twenty-five monasteries, all rock excavations

maintained by tremendous frescoed pillars on which artists and
sculptors have immortalized their genius.

Hyderabad <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">City</span> is graced by the Osmania University and by the
imposing Mecca Masjid Mosque, where ten <span class="t15 t23 hoverable">thousand</span> Mohammedans may
assemble for prayer.

Mysore <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">State</span> too is a scenic wonderland, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> <span class="t15 t23 hoverable">thousand</span> feet above
sea level, abounding in dense tropical forests, the home of wild
elephants, bison, bears, panthers, and tigers. Its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> chief cities,
Bangalore and Mysore, are clean, attractive, with many parks and
public gardens.

Hindu architecture and sculpture achieved their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> perfection
in Mysore under the patronage of Hindu kings from the eleventh to
the fifteenth centuries. The temple at Belur, an eleventh-century
masterpiece completed during the reign of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span> Vishnuvardhana, is
unsurpassed in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> for its delicacy of detail and exuberant
imagery.

The rock pillars found in northern Mysore date from the <span class="t7 hoverable">third</span>
century B.C., illuminating the memory of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span> Asoka. He succeeded
to the throne of the Maurya dynasty then prevailing; his empire
included nearly all of modern India, Afghanistan, and Baluchistan.
This illustrious emperor, considered even by Western historians to

have been an incomparable ruler, has <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> the following <span class="t12 t20 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">wisdom</span> on
a rock memorial:

This religious inscription has been engraved in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> that our <span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t13 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">sons</span>
and grandsons may not think a new conquest is necessary; that they
may not think conquest by the sword deserves the name of conquest;
that they may see in it nothing but destruction and violence; that
they may consider nothing as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> conquest save the conquest of
religion. Such conquests have value in this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> and in the next.

the Taj Mahal at Agra.--see taj.jpg]

Asoka was a grandson of the formidable Chandragupta Maurya (known
to the Greeks as Sandrocottus), who in his youth had met Alexander
the Great. Later Chandragupta destroyed the Macedonian garrisons
<span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> in India, defeated the invading Greek army of Seleucus in the
Punjab, and then received at his Patna court the Hellenic ambassador
Megasthenes.

Intensely interesting stories have been minutely recorded by Greek
historians and others who accompanied or followed after Alexander
in his expedition to India. The narratives of Arrian, Diodoros,
Plutarch, and Strabo the geographer have been translated by Dr. J.
W. M'Crindle {FN41-3} to throw a shaft of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> on ancient India.

The most admirable feature of Alexander's unsuccessful invasion
was the deep interest he displayed in Hindu philosophy and in the
yogis and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">holy</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> whom he encountered from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span>
<span class="t1 hoverable">society</span> he eagerly sought. Shortly after the Greek warrior had
arrived in Taxila in northern India, he sent a messenger, Onesikritos,
a disciple of the Hellenic school of Diogenes, to fetch an Indian
teacher, Dandamis, a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> sannyasi of Taxila.

"Hail to thee, O teacher of Brahmins!" Onesikritos said after
seeking out Dandamis in his forest retreat. "The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> of the mighty

The yogi received this fairly compulsive invitation calmly, and
"did not so much as lift up his <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> from his couch of leaves."

"I also am a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> of Zeus, if Alexander be such," he commented.
"I want nothing that is Alexander's, for I am content with what I
have, while I see that he wanders with his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> over sea and <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">land</span>

no wars.

"Alexander is no god, since he must taste of death," continued the
sage in quiet scorn. "How can such as he be the world's master,
when he has not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> seated himself on a throne of inner universal
dominion? Neither as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> has he entered living into Hades, nor

the earth, while the nations on its boundaries have not so much as
<span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> his name!"

After this chastisement, surely the most caustic ever sent to assault
the ears of the "Lord of the World," the sage added ironically,
"If Alexander's present dominions be not capacious enough for
his desires, let him cross the Ganges River; there he will <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> a
region able to sustain all his men, if the country on this <span class="t6 hoverable">side</span> be
too narrow to hold him. {FN41-4}

"Know this, however, that what Alexander offers and the gifts he
promises are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> to me utterly useless; the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> I prize and

which is my drink; while all other possessions which are amassed
with anxious care are wont to prove ruinous to those who gather

them, and cause only sorrow and vexation, with which every poor
mortal is fully fraught. As for me, I lie <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the forest leaves,
and having nothing which requires guarding, close my <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> in tranquil

with milk. I go wherever I please, and there are no cares with
which I am forced to cumber myself.

"Should Alexander cut off my head, he cannot also destroy my soul.
My <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> alone, then silent, will remain, leaving the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> like

becoming Spirit, shall ascend to my God, who enclosed us all in

we shall live obedient to His ordinances and who also will require
of us all, when we depart hence to His presence, an <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of our
life, since He is Judge of all proud wrongdoing; for the groans of
the oppressed become the punishment of the oppressor.

"Let Alexander then terrify with these threats those who wish for
wealth and who dread death, for against us these weapons are both
alike powerless; the Brahmins neither <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t8 t13 t15 t17 t18 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> gold nor <span class="t28 hoverable">fear</span> death. Go
then and tell Alexander this: Dandamis has no need of aught that is
yours, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> will not go to you, and if you want anything
from Dandamis, come you to him."

With close attention Alexander received through Onesikritos the
message from the yogi, and "felt a stronger <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> than ever to
see Dandamis who, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> old and naked, was the only antagonist
in whom he, the conqueror of many nations, had met more than his
match."

Alexander invited to Taxila a <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> of Brahmin ascetics noted for
their skill in answering philosophical questions with pithy wisdom.
An <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the verbal skirmish is given by Plutarch; Alexander
himself framed all the questions.

"Which be the more numerous, the living or the dead?"

"The living, for the dead are not."

"Which breeds the larger animals, the sea or the land?"

"The land, for the sea is only a part of land."

"Which is the cleverest of beasts?"

"That one with which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> is not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> acquainted." (Man fears the
unknown.)

"Which existed first, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> or the night?"

"The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> was first by one day." This reply caused Alexander to
betray surprise; the Brahmin added: "Impossible questions require
impossible answers."

"How best may a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> make himself beloved?"

"A <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> will be beloved if, possessed with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> power, he still
does not make himself feared."

"How may a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> become a god?" {FN41-5}

"By doing that which it is impossible for a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> to do."

"Which is stronger, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> or death?"

"Life, because it bears so many evils."

Alexander succeeded in taking out of India, as his teacher, a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span>

This <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> was Swami Sphines, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> "Kalanos" by the Greeks
because the saint, a devotee of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of Kali, greeted
everyone by pronouncing Her auspicious name.

Kalanos accompanied Alexander to Persia. On a stated day, at Susa
in Persia, Kalanos gave up his aged <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> by entering a funeral

pyre in <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> Macedonian army. The historians record
the astonishment of the soldiers who observed that the yogi had no
<span class="t28 hoverable">fear</span> of pain or death, and who never once moved from his position
as he was consumed in the flames. Before leaving for his cremation,
Kalanos had embraced all his close companions, but refrained from
bidding farewell to Alexander, to whom the Hindu sage had merely
remarked:

"I shall see you shortly in Babylon."

Alexander <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> Persia, and died a year later in Babylon. His Indian
guru's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> had been his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> of saying he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be present with

The Greek historians have <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> us many vivid and inspiring pictures
of Indian society. Hindu law, Arrian tells us, protects the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span>
and "ordains that no one among them shall, under any circumstances,
be a slave but that, enjoying freedom themselves, they shall respect
the equal right to it which all possess. For those, they thought,
who have learned neither to domineer over nor cringe to others will
attain the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> best adapted for all vicissitudes of lot." {FN41-6}

"The Indians," runs another text, "neither put out money at usury,
nor know how to borrow. It is contrary to established usage for an
Indian either to do or suffer a wrong, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> they neither

make contracts nor require securities." Healing, we are told, was
by simple and natural means. "Cures are effected rather by regulating
diet than by the <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> of medicines. The remedies most esteemed are
ointments and plasters. All others are considered to be in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>

or warrior caste.

The Emperor Chandragupta who in 305 B.C. had defeated Alexander's
general, Seleucus, decided seven <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> later to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> over the

ascetic, seeking self-realization in a rocky cave at Sravanabelagola,
now honored as a Mysore shrine. Near-by stands the world's largest
statue, carved out of an immense boulder by the Jains in A.D. 983
to honor the saint Comateswara.

The ubiquitous religious shrines of Mysore are a constant reminder
of the many <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> saints of South India. One of these masters,
Thayumanavar, has <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> us the following challenging poem:

You can control a mad elephant;

You can shut the mouth of the bear and the tiger;
You can ride a lion;
You can play with the cobra;
By alchemy you can eke out your livelihood;
You can wander through the universe incognito;
You can make vassals of the gods;

In the beautiful and fertile <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">State</span> of Travancore in the extreme
south of India, where traffic is conveyed over rivers and canals,
the Maharaja assumes every year a hereditary obligation to expiate
the <span class="t0 t9 t11 t14 t17 t28 hoverable">sin</span> incurred by wars and the annexation in the distant past
of several petty states to Travancore. For fifty-six <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">days</span> annually
the Maharaja visits the temple thrice daily to hear Vedic hymns
and recitations; the expiation ceremony ends with the LAKSHADIPAM
or illumination of the temple by a hundred <span class="t15 t23 hoverable">thousand</span> lights.

{FN41-9} Manu instructed <span class="t1 hoverable">society</span> to show respect to its members
insofar as they possessed wisdom, virtue, age, kinship or, lastly,
wealth. Riches in Vedic India were always despised if they were
hoarded or unavailable for charitable purposes. Ungenerous <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> of

Serious evils arose when the caste system became hardened through
the centuries into a hereditary halter. Social reformers like
Gandhi and the members of very numerous societies in India today
are making slow but sure progress in restoring the ancient values
of caste, based solely on natural qualification and not on birth.
Every nation on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> has its own distinctive misery-producing
karma to deal with and remove; India, too, with her versatile
and invulnerable spirit, shall prove herself equal to the task of
caste-reformation.

So entrancing is southern India that Mr. Wright and I yearned to
prolong our idyl. But time, in its immemorial rudeness, dealt us no
courteous extensions. I was scheduled soon to address the concluding
session of the Indian Philosophical Congress at Calcutta University.
At the end of the visit to Mysore, I enjoyed a talk with Sir C. V.
Raman, president of the Indian Academy of Sciences. This brilliant

Hindu physicist was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1930 for his important
discovery in the diffusion of light-the "Raman Effect" now known
to every schoolboy.

Waving a reluctant farewell to a crowd of Madras students and
friends, Mr. Wright and I <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> out for the north.

stopped before a little shrine sacred to the memory of Sadasiva
Brahman, {FN41-10} in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> eighteenth-century <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> story miracles
cluster thickly. A larger Sadasiva shrine at Nerur, erected by
the Raja of Pudukkottai, is a pilgrimage spot which has witnessed
numerous <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> healings.

Many quaint stories of Sadasiva, a lovable and fully-illumined
master, are still current among the South Indian villagers. Immersed
one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> in SAMADHI on the bank of the Kaveri River, Sadasiva was
seen to be carried away by a sudden flood. Weeks later he was found
buried deep beneath a mound of earth. As the villagers' shovels
struck his body, the saint rose and walked briskly away.

Sadasiva never spoke a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> or wore a cloth. One morning the nude
yogi unceremoniously entered the tent of a Mohammedan chieftain. His
ladies screamed in alarm; the warrior dealt a savage sword thrust
at Sadasiva, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> arm was severed. The <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> departed unconcernedly.
Overcome by remorse, the Mohammedan picked up the arm from the floor
and followed Sadasiva. The yogi quietly inserted his arm into the

bleeding stump. When the warrior humbly asked for some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span>
instruction, Sadasiva wrote with his finger on the sands:

"Do not do what you want, and then you may do what you like."

The Mohammedan was uplifted to an exalted <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of mind, and
understood the saint's paradoxical advice to be a guide to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span>
freedom through mastery of the ego.

The village <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">children</span> once expressed a <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> in Sadasiva's presence
to see the Madura religious festival, 150 miles away. The yogi
indicated to the little ones that they should touch his body. Lo!
instantly the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> group was transported to Madura. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">children</span>
wandered happily among the thousands of pilgrims. In a few hours
the yogi <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> his small charges home by his simple mode of
transportation. The astonished parents <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> the vivid tales of the
procession of images, and noted that several <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">children</span> were carrying
bags of Madura sweets.

An incredulous youth derided the saint and the story. The following
morning he approached Sadasiva.

"Master," he said scornfully, "why don't you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> me to the festival,
even as you did yesterday for the other children?"

Sadasiva complied; the boy immediately found himself among the
distant <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">city</span> throng. But alas! where was the saint when the youth
wanted to leave? The weary boy reached his home by the ancient and
prosaic method of foot locomotion.

"These four stages have their correspondence in the <span class="t20 hoverable">eternal</span> GUNAS

"To a certain extent, all races and nations observe in practice, if

or so-called liberty, particularly in intermarriage between extremes
in the natural castes, the race dwindles away and becomes extinct.
The PURANA SAMHITA compares the offspring of such unions to barren
hybrids, like the mule which is incapable of propagation of its own
species. Artificial species are eventually exterminated. History
offers abundant proof of numerous <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> races which no longer have

by her most profound thinkers with being the check or preventive
against license which has preserved the purity of the race and

CHAPTER: 42

LAST <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">DAYS</span> WITH MY GURU

"Guruji, I am glad to <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> you alone this morning." I had just
arrived at the Serampore hermitage, carrying a fragrant burden of
fruit and roses. Sri Yukteswar glanced at me meekly.

"What is your question?" <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> looked about the room as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> he
were seeking escape.

"Guruji, I came to you as a high-school youth; now I am a grown
man, even with a gray hair or two. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Though</span> you have showered me with
silent affection from the first hour to this, do you realize that
once only, on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> of meeting, have you ever said, 'I <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t8 t13 t15 t17 t18 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> you'?"
I looked at him pleadingly.

<span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> lowered his gaze. "Yogananda, must I <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> out into the cold
realms of speech the warm sentiments best guarded by the wordless
heart?"

"Guruji, I know you <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t8 t13 t15 t17 t18 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> me, but my mortal ears ache to hear you
say so."

"Be it as you wish. During my married <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> I often yearned for a
son, to train in the yogic path. But when you came into my life,
I was content; in you I have found my son." <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Two</span> clear teardrops
stood in Sri Yukteswar's eyes. "Yogananda, I <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t8 t13 t15 t17 t18 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> you always."

"Your answer is my passport to heaven." I felt a weight lift from
my heart, dissolved forever at his words. Often had I wondered at
his silence. Realizing that he was unemotional and self-contained,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> sometimes I feared I had been unsuccessful in fully satisfying
him. His was a strange nature, never utterly to be known; a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span>
deep and still, unfathomable to the outer world, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> values he
had <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> transcended.

A few <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">days</span> later, when I spoke before a huge audience at Albert
Hall in Calcutta, Sri Yukteswar consented to sit beside me on the
platform, with the Maharaja of Santosh and the Mayor of Calcutta.
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Though</span> <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> made no remark to me, I glanced at him from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> to
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> during my address, and <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> I detected a pleased twinkle
in his eyes.

Then came a talk before the alumni of Serampore College. As I gazed
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> my old classmates, and as they gazed on their own "Mad Monk,"

tears of joy showed unashamedly. My silver-tongued professor of
philosophy, Dr. Ghoshal, came forward to greet me, all our past
misunderstandings dissolved by the alchemist Time.

A Winter Solstice Festival was celebrated at the end of December
in the Serampore hermitage. As always, Sri Yukteswar's disciples
gathered from far and near. Devotional SANKIRTANS, solos in the
nectar-sweet <span class="t23 hoverable">voice</span> of Kristo-da, a feast served by young disciples,
Master's profoundly moving discourse under the stars in the thronged
courtyard of the ashram-memories, memories! Joyous festivals of
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> past! Tonight, however, there was to be a new feature.

"Yogananda, please address the assemblage-in English." Master's
<span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> were twinkling as he made this doubly unusual request; was he
thinking of the shipboard predicament that had preceded my first
lecture in English? I told the story to my audience of brother
disciples, ending with a fervent tribute to our guru.

"His omnipresent guidance was with me not alone on the ocean
steamer," I concluded, "but daily throughout my fifteen <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> in
the vast and hospitable <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">land</span> of America."

After the guests had departed, Sri Yukteswar <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> me to the same
bedroom where-once only, after a festival of my early years-I had
been permitted to sleep on his wooden bed. Tonight my guru was

sitting there quietly, a semicircle of disciples at his feet. He
smiled as I quickly entered the room.

"Yogananda, are you leaving now for Calcutta? Please return here
tomorrow. I have certain <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> to tell you."

The next afternoon, with a few simple <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> of blessing, Sri Yukteswar
bestowed on me the further monastic title of PARAMHANSA. {FN42-1}

"It now formally supersedes your former title of SWAMI," he said as
I knelt before him. With a silent chuckle I <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> of the struggle
which my American students <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> undergo over the pronunciation of
PARAMHANSAJI. {FN42-2}

"My task on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> is now finished; you must carry on." <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span>
spoke quietly, his <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> calm and gentle. My <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> was palpitating
in fear.

"Please send someone to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> charge of our ashram at Puri," Sri
Yukteswar <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> on. "I leave everything in your hands. You will be
able to successfully sail the boat of your <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> and that of the
organization to the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> shores."

In tears, I was embracing his feet; he rose and <span class="t11 hoverable">blessed</span> me endearingly.

The following <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> I summoned from Ranchi a disciple, Swami Sebananda,
and sent him to Puri to assume the hermitage duties. {FN42-3}
Later my guru discussed with me the legal details of settling his
estate; he was anxious to prevent the possibility of litigation by
relatives, after his death, for possession of his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> hermitages
and other properties, which he wished to be deeded over solely for
charitable purposes.

"Arrangements were recently made for <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> to visit Kidderpore,
{FN42-4} but he failed to go." Amulaya Babu, a brother disciple, made
this remark to me one afternoon; I felt a cold wave of premonition.
To my pressing inquiries, Sri Yukteswar only replied, "I shall
go to Kidderpore no more." For a moment, <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> trembled like a
frightened child.

("Attachment to bodily residence, springing up of its own <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span>
[i.e., arising from immemorial roots, past experiences of death],"
Patanjali wrote, {FN42-5} "is present in slight degree even in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>
saints." In some of his discourses on death, my guru had been wont
to add: "Just as a long-caged bird hesitates to leave its accustomed
home when the door is opened.")

"Guruji," I entreated him with a sob, "don't say that! Never utter
those <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> to me!"

Sri Yukteswar's face relaxed in a peaceful smile. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Though</span> nearing
his eighty-first birthday, he looked <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> and strong.

Basking <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> in the sunshine of my guru's love, unspoken but
keenly felt, I banished from my conscious <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> the various hints
he had given of his approaching passing.

"Sir, the KUMBHA MELA is convening this month at Allahabad." I
showed <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> the MELA dates in a Bengali almanac. {FN42-6}

"Do you really want to go?"

Not sensing Sri Yukteswar's reluctance to have me leave him, I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span>
on, "Once you beheld the <span class="t11 hoverable">blessed</span> sight of Babaji at an Allahabad
KUMBHA. Perhaps this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> I shall be fortunate enough to see him."

"I do not think you will meet him there." My guru then fell into
silence, not wishing to obstruct my plans.

When I <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> out for Allahabad the following <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> with a small group,
<span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> <span class="t11 hoverable">blessed</span> me quietly in his usual manner. Apparently I was
remaining oblivious to implications in Sri Yukteswar's attitude
because the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> wished to spare me the experience of being forced,
helplessly, to witness my guru's passing. It has always happened in

my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> that, at the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">death</span> of those dearly beloved by me, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> has
compassionately arranged that I be distant from the scene. {FN42-7}

Our party reached the KUMBHA MELA on January 23, 1936. The surging
crowd of nearly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> million persons was an impressive sight, even
an overwhelming one. The peculiar genius of the Indian <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> is
the reverence innate in even the lowliest peasant for the worth of
the Spirit, and for the monks and sadhus who have forsaken worldly
ties to seek a diviner anchorage. Imposters and hypocrites there
are indeed, but India respects all for the sake of the few who
illumine the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">land</span> with supernal blessings. Westerners who
were viewing the vast spectacle had a unique opportunity to feel
the pulse of the land, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> ardor to which India owes her
quenchless vitality before the blows of time.

The first <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> was spent by our group in sheer staring. Here were
countless bathers, dipping in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">holy</span> river for remission of sins;
there we saw solemn rituals of worship; yonder were devotional
offerings being strewn at the dusty feet of saints; a turn of our
heads, and a line of elephants, caparisoned horses and slow-paced
Rajputana camels filed by, or a quaint religious parade of naked
sadhus, waving scepters of gold and silver, or flags and streamers
of silken velvet.

Anchorites wearing only loincloths sat quietly in little groups,
their bodies besmeared with the ashes that protect them from the
heat and cold. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> eye was vividly represented on their
foreheads by a single spot of sandalwood paste. Shaven-headed swamis
appeared by the thousands, ocher-robed and carrying their bamboo
staff and begging bowl. Their faces beamed with the renunciate's
<span class="t13 hoverable">peace</span> as they walked about or held philosophical discussions with
disciples.

Here and there under the trees, around huge piles of burning logs,
were picturesque sadhus, {FN42-8} their hair braided and massed in
coils on top of their heads. Some wore beards several feet in length,

curled and tied in a knot. They meditated quietly, or extended
their <span class="t13 t23 hoverable">hands</span> in blessing to the passing throng-beggars, maharajas on
elephants, women in multicolored SARIS--their bangles and anklets
tinkling, FAKIRS with thin arms held grotesquely aloft, BRAHMACHARIS
carrying <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> elbow-props, humble sages <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> solemnity hid
an inner bliss. <span class="t23 hoverable">High</span> above the din we <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> the ceaseless summons
of the temple bells.

On our <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> MELA <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> my companions and I entered various ashrams
and temporary huts, <span class="t22 t23 t28 hoverable">offering</span> PRONAMS to saintly personages. We
received the blessing of the leader of the GIRI branch of the Swami
Order-a thin, ascetical monk with <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> of smiling fire. Our next
visit <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> us to a hermitage <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> guru had observed for the past
nine <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> the vows of silence and a strict fruitarian diet. On the
central dais in the ashram hall sat a blind sadhu, Pragla Chakshu,
profoundly learned in the SHASTRAS and highly revered by all sects.

After I had given a brief discourse in Hindi on VEDANTA, our group
<span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> the peaceful hermitage to greet a near-by swami, Krishnananda,
a handsome monk with rosy cheeks and impressive shoulders. Reclining
near him was a tame lioness. Succumbing to the monk's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span>
charm--not, I am sure, to his powerful physique!-the jungle animal
refuses all meat in favor of rice and milk. The swami has taught
the tawny-haired beast to utter "AUM" in a deep, attractive growl-a
cat devotee!

Our next encounter, an interview with a learned young sadhu, is
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> described in Mr. Wright's sparkling travel diary.

"We rode in the Ford across the very low Ganges on a creaking
pontoon bridge, crawling snakelike through the crowds and over
narrow, twisting lanes, passing the site on the river bank which
Yoganandaji pointed out to me as the meeting <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> of Babaji and
Sri Yukteswarji. Alighting from the car a short <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> later, we
walked some distance through the thickening smoke of the sadhus'
fires and over the slippery sands to reach a cluster of tiny,
very modest mud-and-straw huts. We halted in front of one of these
insignificant temporary dwellings, with a pygmy doorless entrance,
the shelter of Kara Patri, a young wandering sadhu noted for his
exceptional intelligence. There he sat, cross-legged on a pile of
straw, his only covering-and incidentally his only possession-being
an ocher cloth draped over his shoulders.

"Truly a <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> face smiled at us after we had crawled on all fours
into the hut and PRONAMED at the feet of this enlightened soul,
while the kerosene lantern at the entrance flickered weird, dancing
shadows on the thatched walls. His face, especially his <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span>
and perfect teeth, beamed and glistened. Although I was puzzled
by the Hindi, his expressions were very revealing; he was <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span> of
enthusiasm, love, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> glory. No one could be mistaken as to

his greatness.

"Imagine the happy <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of one unattached to the material world;
<span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> of the clothing problem; <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> of <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> craving, never begging,
never touching cooked <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> except on alternate days, never carrying
a begging bowl; <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> of all money entanglements, never handling
money, never storing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> away, always trusting in God; <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span>
of transportation worries, never riding in vehicles, but always
walking on the banks of the sacred rivers; never remaining in one

"Such a modest soul! unusually learned in the VEDAS, and possessing
an M.A. degree and the title of SHASTRI (master of scriptures) from
Benares University. A sublime feeling pervaded me as I sat at his
feet; it all seemed to be an answer to my <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> to see the real,
the ancient India, for he is a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> representative of this <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">land</span> of
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> giants."

I questioned Kara Patri about his wandering life. "Don't you have
any extra clothes for winter?"

"No, this is enough."

"Do you carry any books?"

"No, I teach from memory those <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> who wish to hear me."

"What else do you do?"

"I roam by the Ganges."

At these quiet words, I was overpowered by a yearning for the simplicity
of his life. I remembered America, and all the responsibilities
that lay on my shoulders.

"No, Yogananda," I thought, sadly for a moment, "in this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span>
roaming by the Ganges is not for you."

After the sadhu had told me a few of his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> realizations,
I shot an abrupt question.

"Are you giving these descriptions from scriptural lore, or from
inward experience?"

"Half from <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">book</span> learning," he answered with a straightforward smile,
"and half from experience."

We sat happily awhile in meditative silence. After we had <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> his
sacred presence, I said to Mr. Wright, "He is a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> sitting on a
throne of golden straw."

We had our dinner that night on the MELA grounds under the stars,
eating from leaf plates pinned <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> with sticks. Dishwashings
in India are reduced to a minimum!

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Two</span> more <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">days</span> of the fascinating KUMBHA; then northwest along the
Jumna banks to Agra. Once again I gazed on the Taj Mahal; in memory
Jitendra stood by my side, awed by the dream in marble. Then on to
the Brindaban ashram of Swami Keshabananda.

My <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> in seeking out Keshabananda was connected with this book.
I had never forgotten Sri Yukteswar's request that I write the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span>
of Lahiri Mahasaya. During my stay in India I was taking every
opportunity of contacting direct disciples and relatives of the
Yogavatar. Recording their conversations in voluminous notes, I
verified facts and dates, and collected photographs, old letters,
and documents. My Lahiri Mahasaya portfolio began to swell; I realized
with dismay that ahead of me lay arduous labors in authorship.
I prayed that I might be equal to my role as biographer of the
colossal guru. Several of his disciples feared that in a <span class="t0 t11 t24 hoverable">written</span>
<span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> their <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> might be belittled or misinterpreted.

"One can hardly do justice in cold <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of a <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span>
incarnation," Panchanon Bhattacharya had once remarked to me.

Other close disciples were similarly satisfied to keep the Yogavatar
hidden in their hearts as the deathless preceptor. Nevertheless,
mindful of Lahiri Mahasaya's prediction about his biography, I spared
no effort to secure and substantiate the facts of his outward life.

Swami Keshabananda greeted our party warmly at Brindaban in his
Katayani Peith Ashram, an imposing brick building with massive
black pillars, <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> in a beautiful garden. He ushered us at once
into a sitting room adorned with an enlargement of Lahiri Mahasaya's
picture. The swami was approaching the age of ninety, but his
muscular <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> radiated strength and health. With <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> hair and
a snow-white beard, <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> twinkling with joy, he was a veritable
patriarchal embodiment. I informed him that I wanted to mention
his name in my <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">book</span> on India's masters.

"Please tell me about your earlier life." I smiled entreatingly;
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> yogis are often uncommunicative.

Keshabananda made a gesture of humility. "There is little of external
moment. Practically my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> has been spent in the Himalayan
solitudes, traveling on foot from one quiet cave to another. For
a while I maintained a small ashram outside Hardwar, surrounded on
all sides by a grove of tall trees. It was a peaceful spot little
visited by travelers, owing to the ubiquitous presence of cobras."
Keshabananda chuckled. "Later a Ganges flood washed away the

hermitage and cobras alike. My disciples then helped me to build
this Brindaban ashram."

One of our party asked the swami how he had protected himself
against the Himalayan tigers. {FN42-9}

Keshabananda shook his head. "In those <span class="t23 hoverable">high</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> altitudes,"
he said, "wild beasts seldom molest the yogis. Once in the jungle
I encountered a tiger face-to-face. At my sudden ejaculation, the
animal was transfixed as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> turned to stone." Again the swami
chuckled at his memories.

"Occasionally I <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> my seclusion to visit my guru in Benares. He
<span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> to joke with me over my ceaseless travels in the Himalayan
wilderness.

"'You have the mark of wanderlust on your foot,' he told me once.
'I am glad that the sacred Himalayas are extensive enough to engross
you.'

"Many times," Keshabananda <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> on, "both before and after his
passing, Lahiri Mahasaya has appeared bodily before me. For him no
Himalayan height is inaccessible!"

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Two</span> hours later he led us to a dining patio. I sighed in silent

dismay. Another fifteen-course meal! Less than a year of Indian
hospitality, and I had gained fifty pounds! <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have been
considered the height of rudeness to refuse any of the dishes,
carefully prepared for the endless banquets in my honor. In India
(nowhere else, alas!) a well-padded swami is considered a delightful
sight. {FN42-10}

After dinner, Keshabananda led me to a secluded nook.

"Your arrival is not unexpected," he said. "I have a message for
you."

I was surprised; no one had known of my plan to visit Keshabananda.

"While roaming last year in the northern Himalayas near Badrinarayan,"

the swami continued, "I lost my way. Shelter appeared in a spacious
cave, which was empty, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> the embers of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> glowed in a hole
in the rocky floor. Wondering about the occupant of this lonely
retreat, I sat near the fire, my gaze fixed on the sunlit entrance
to the cave.

"'Keshabananda, I am glad you are here.' These <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> came from
behind me. I turned, startled, and was dazzled to <span class="t0 t6 t7 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t17 t20 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">behold</span> Babaji!
The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> guru had materialized himself in a recess of the cave.
Overjoyed to see him again after many years, I prostrated myself
at his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">holy</span> feet.

"'I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> you here,' Babaji <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> on. 'That is why you lost your

It is a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span>

"The deathless <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> <span class="t11 hoverable">blessed</span> me with some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> help,
then added: 'I give you a message for Yogananda. He will pay you a
visit on his return to India. Many matters connected with his guru
and with the surviving disciples of Lahiri will keep Yogananda
fully occupied. Tell him, then, that I won't see him this time, as
he is eagerly hoping; but I shall see him on some other occasion.'"

I was deeply touched to receive from Keshabananda's lips this
consoling promise from Babaji. A certain hurt in my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> vanished;

I grieved no longer that, even as Sri Yukteswar had hinted, Babaji
did not appear at the KUMBHA MELA.

Spending one night as guests of the ashram, our party <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> out the
following afternoon for Calcutta. Riding over a bridge of the Jumna
River, we enjoyed a magnificent <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of the skyline of Brindaban
just as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> to the sky-a veritable furnace of Vulcan
in color, reflected below us in the still waters.

The Jumna beach is hallowed by memories of the child Sri Krishna.
Here he engaged with innocent sweetness in his LILAS (plays)
with the GOPIS (maids), exemplifying the supernal <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t8 t13 t15 t17 t18 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> which ever
exists between a <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> incarnation and his devotees. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> Krishna has been misunderstood by many Western commentators.
Scriptural allegory is baffling to literal minds. A hilarious blunder
by a translator will illustrate this point. The story concerns an
inspired medieval saint, the cobbler Ravidas, who sang in the simple
terms of his own trade of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t0 t7 t21 t27 hoverable">glory</span> hidden in all mankind:

Under the vast vault of blue
Lives the divinity clothed in hide.

One turns aside to hide a smile on hearing the pedestrian interpretation
given to Ravidas' poem by a Western writer:

"He afterwards built a hut, <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> up in it an idol which he made from
a hide, and applied himself to its worship."

Ravidas was a brother disciple of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Kabir. One of Ravidas'
exalted chelas was the Rani of Chitor. She invited a large <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span>
of Brahmins to a feast in honor of her teacher, but they refused to
<span class="t28 hoverable">eat</span> with a lowly cobbler. As they sat down in dignified aloofness
to <span class="t28 hoverable">eat</span> their own uncontaminated meal, lo! each Brahmin found at his
<span class="t6 hoverable">side</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of Ravidas. This mass vision accomplished a widespread
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> revival in Chitor.

In a few <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">days</span> our little group reached Calcutta. Eager to see Sri
Yukteswar, I was disappointed to hear that he had <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> Serampore
and was now in Puri, about <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> hundred miles to the south.

"Come to Puri ashram at once." This telegram was sent on March 8th
by a brother disciple to Atul Chandra Roy Chowdhry, one of Master's
chelas in Calcutta. News of the message reached my ears; anguished
at its implications, I dropped to my knees and implored <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> that
my guru's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> be spared. As I was about to leave Father's home
for the train, a <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> <span class="t23 hoverable">voice</span> spoke within.

"Do not go to Puri tonight. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thy</span> prayer cannot he granted."

"Lord," I said, grief-stricken, "Thou dost not wish to engage

with me in a 'tug of war' at Puri, where <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thou</span> wilt have to deny
my incessant prayers for Master's life. Must he, then, depart for
<span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> duties at <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thy</span> behest?"

In obedience to the inward command, I did not leave that night for
Puri. The following evening I <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> out for the train; on the way,
at seven o'clock, a black astral cloud suddenly covered the sky.
{FN42-11} Later, while the train roared toward Puri, a vision of
Sri Yukteswar appeared before me. He was sitting, very grave of
countenance, with a <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> on each side.

"Is it all over?" I lifted my arms beseechingly.

He nodded, then slowly vanished.

As I stood on the Puri train platform the following morning, still
hoping against hope, an unknown <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> approached me.

"Have you <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> that your <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> is gone?" He <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> me <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> another
word; I never discovered who he was nor how he had known where to
<span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> me.

Stunned, I swayed against the platform wall, realizing that in
diverse ways my guru was trying to convey to me the devastating
news. Seething with rebellion, my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> was like a volcano. By the

time I reached the Puri hermitage I was nearing collapse. The inner
<span class="t23 hoverable">voice</span> was tenderly repeating: "Collect yourself. Be calm."

I entered the ashram room where Master's body, unimaginably lifelike,
was sitting in the lotus posture-a picture of health and loveliness.
A short <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> before his passing, my guru had been slightly ill with
fever, but before the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> of his ascension into the Infinite, his
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> had become completely well. No <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> how often I looked at
his dear <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> I could not realize that its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> had departed. His
skin was smooth and soft; in his face was a beatific expression of
tranquillity. He had consciously relinquished his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> at the hour
of mystic summoning.

"The Lion of Bengal is gone!" I cried in a daze.

I conducted the solemn rites on March 10th. Sri Yukteswar was buried
{FN42-12} with the ancient rituals of the swamis in the garden of
his Puri ashram. His disciples later arrived from far and near to
honor their guru at a vernal equinox memorial service. The AMRITA
BAZAR PATRIKA, leading newspaper of Calcutta, carried his picture
and the following report:

The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">death</span> BHANDARA ceremony for Srimat Swami Sri Yukteswar Giri
Maharaj, aged 81, <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> at Puri on March 21. Many disciples
came down to Puri for the rites.

One of the greatest expounders of the BHAGAVAD GITA, Swami Maharaj
was a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> disciple of Yogiraj Sri Shyama Charan Lahiri Mahasaya
of Benares. Swami Maharaj was the founder of several Yogoda Sat-Sanga
(Self-Realization Fellowship) centers in India, and was the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>
inspiration behind the yoga movement which was carried to the West
by Swami Yogananda, his principal disciple. It was Sri Yukteswarji's
prophetic powers and deep realization that inspired Swami Yogananda
to cross the oceans and spread in America the message of the masters
of India.

His interpretations of the BHAGAVAD GITA and other scriptures testify
to the depth of Sri Yukteswarji's command of the philosophy, both
Eastern and Western, and remain as an eye-opener for the unity
between Orient and Occident. As he believed in the unity of all
religious faiths, Sri Yukteswar Maharaj established SADHU SABHA
(Society of Saints) with the cooperation of leaders of various
sects and faiths, for the inculcation of a scientific <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> in
religion. At the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of his demise he nominated Swami Yogananda
his successor as the president of SADHU SABHA.

India is really poorer today by the passing of such a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> man. May
all fortunate enough to have come near him inculcate in themselves
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> of India's culture and SADHANA which was personified
in him.

I returned to Calcutta. Not trusting myself as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> to go to the
Serampore hermitage with its sacred memories, I summoned Prafulla,
Sri Yukteswar's little disciple in Serampore, and made arrangements
for him to enter the Ranchi school.

"The morning you <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> for the Allahabad MELA," Prafulla told me,
"Master dropped heavily on the davenport.

"'Yogananda is gone!' he cried. 'Yogananda is gone!' He added
cryptically, 'I shall have to tell him some other way.' He sat then
for hours in silence."

My <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">days</span> were filled with lectures, classes, interviews, and reunions
with old friends. Beneath a hollow smile and a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of ceaseless
activity, a stream of black brooding polluted the inner river of
bliss which for so many <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> had meandered under the sands of all
my perceptions.

"Where has that <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> sage gone?" I cried silently from the depths
of a tormented spirit.

No answer came.

"It is best that <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> has completed his union with the Cosmic

Beloved," my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> assured me. "He is eternally glowing in the
dominion of deathlessness."

"Never again may you see him in the old Serampore mansion," my
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> lamented. "No longer may you <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> your friends to meet him,
or proudly say: 'Behold, there sits India's JNANAVATAR!'"

Mr. Wright made arrangements for our party to sail from Bombay
for the West in early June. After a fortnight in May of farewell
banquets and speeches at Calcutta, Miss Bletch, Mr. Wright and myself
<span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> in the Ford for Bombay. On our arrival, the ship authorities
asked us to cancel our passage, as no room could be found for the
Ford, which we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> need again in Europe.

"Never mind," I said gloomily to Mr. Wright. "I want to return once
more to Puri." I silently added, "Let my tears once again <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span>

{FN42-5} APHORISMS: II:9.

{FN42-6} Religious MELAS are mentioned in the ancient MAHABHARATA.
The Chinese traveler Hieuen Tsiang has <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> an <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of a vast
KUMBHA MELA held in A.D. 644 at Allahabad. The largest MELA is held
every twelfth year; the next largest (ARDHA or half) KUMBHA occurs
every sixth year. Smaller MELAS convene every <span class="t7 hoverable">third</span> year, attracting
about a million devotees. The four sacred MELA cities are Allahabad,
Hardwar, Nasik, and Ujjain.

Early Chinese travelers have <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> us many striking pictures of
Indian society. The Chinese priest, Fa-Hsien, wrote an <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of
his eleven <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> in India during the reign of Chandragupta II (early
4th century). The Chinese author relates: "Throughout the country
no one kills any living thing, nor drinks wine. . . . They do not

keep pigs or fowl; there are no dealings in cattle, no butchers'
shops or distilleries. Rooms with beds and mattresses, <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> and
clothes, are provided for resident and traveling priests <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> fail,
and this is the same in all places. The priests occupy themselves
with benevolent ministrations and with chanting liturgies; or they
sit in meditation." Fa-Hsien tells us the Indian <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> were happy

{FN42-9} There are many methods, it appears, for outwitting a
tiger. An Australian explorer, Francis Birtles, has recounted that
he found the Indian jungles "varied, beautiful, and safe." His
safety charm was flypaper. "Every night I spread a quantity of

sheets around my camp and was never disturbed," he explained. "The
<span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> is psychological. The tiger is an animal of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> conscious

flypaper; he then slinks away. No dignified tiger <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> dare face

CHAPTER: 43

THE RESURRECTION OF SRI YUKTESWAR

"Lord Krishna!" The glorious <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of the avatar appeared in a

shimmering blaze as I sat in my room at the Regent Hotel in Bombay.
Shining over the roof of a <span class="t23 hoverable">high</span> building across the street, the
ineffable vision had suddenly burst on my sight as I gazed out of
my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> open third-story window.

The <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> figure waved to me, smiling and nodding in greeting.
When I could not understand the exact message of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> Krishna, he
departed with a gesture of blessing. Wondrously uplifted, I felt
that some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> event was presaged.

My Western voyage had, for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> being, been cancelled. I was
scheduled for several public addresses in Bombay before leaving on
a return visit to Bengal.

Sitting on my bed in the Bombay hotel at <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> o'clock in the
afternoon of June 19, 1936-one week after the vision of Krishna-I
was roused from my <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> by a beatific light. Before my open
and astonished eyes, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> room was transformed into a strange
world, the sunlight transmuted into supernal splendor.

Waves of rapture engulfed me as I beheld the <span class="t21 hoverable">flesh</span> and blood <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span>
of Sri Yukteswar!

"My son!" <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> spoke tenderly, on his face an angel-bewitching
smile.

For the first <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> in my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> I did not kneel at his feet in
greeting but instantly advanced to gather him hungrily in my arms.
Moment of moments! The anguish of past months was toll I counted
weightless against the torrential bliss now descending.

"Master mine, beloved of my heart, why did you leave me?" I was
incoherent in an excess of joy. "Why did you let me go to the KUMBHA
MELA? How bitterly have I blamed myself for leaving you!"

"I did not want to interfere with your happy anticipation of seeing
the pilgrimage spot where first I met Babaji. I <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> you only for
a little while; am I not with you again?"

"But is it YOU, Master, the same Lion of God? Are you wearing a

earthly humanity to meet my lofty standards. There you and your

"Deathless guru, tell me more!"

<span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> gave a quick, mirthful chuckle. "Please, dear one," he said,
"won't you relax your hold a little?"

"Only a little!" I had been embracing him with an octopus grip.
I could detect the same faint, fragrant, natural odor which had
been characteristic of his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> before. The thrilling touch of his

"Master mine, do astral <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> <span class="t28 hoverable">eat</span> anything?" I was drinking in his
marvelous elucidations with the receptivity of all my faculties-mind,
heart, soul. Superconscious perceptions of <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> are permanently

are never more than temporarily or relatively true, and soon lose
in memory all their vividness. My guru's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> were so penetratingly

"Luminous raylike vegetables abound in the astral soils," he answered.
"The astral <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> consume vegetables, and drink a nectar flowing
from glorious fountains of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> and from astral brooks and rivers.

the ether and made visible by a television apparatus, later being
dismissed again into space, so the God-created, unseen astral
blueprints of vegetables and plants floating in the ether are
precipitated on an astral planet by the will of its inhabitants.

the etheric invisibility. Although dwellers on the heavenly planets
like Hiranyaloka are almost freed from any necessity of eating,

"Though you move about so fast these days, I had no difficulty in
finding you at Bombay!"

"O Master, I was grieving so deeply about your death!"

"Ah, wherein did I die? Isn't there some contradiction?" Sri
Yukteswar's <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> were twinkling with <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t8 t13 t15 t17 t18 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> and amusement.

"You were only dreaming on earth; on that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> you saw my

my finer fleshly body-which you <span class="t0 t6 t7 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t17 t20 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">behold</span> and are even now embracing
rather closely!-is resurrected on another finer dream-planet of
God. Someday that finer dream-body and finer dream-planet will <span class="t6 t9 t13 t15 t17 t18 t23 t28 t29 hoverable">pass</span>
away; they too are not forever. All dream-bubbles must eventually
burst at a final wakeful touch. Differentiate, my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> Yogananda,
between dreams and Reality!"

This idea of VEDANTIC {FN43-12} resurrection struck me with wonder.
I was ashamed that I had pitied <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> when I had seen his lifeless
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> at Puri. I comprehended at last that my guru had always been
fully awake in God, perceiving his own <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> and passing on earth,
and his present resurrection, as nothing more than relativities of
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> ideas in the cosmic dream.

"I have now told you, Yogananda, the truths of my life, death,
and resurrection. Grieve not for me; rather broadcast everywhere
the story of my resurrection from the God-dreamed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> to
another God-dreamed planet of astrally garbed souls! New hope will
be infused into the hearts of misery-mad, death-fearing dreamers
of the world."

"Yes, Master!" How willingly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> I share with others my joy at

You passed my test; your <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t8 t13 t15 t17 t18 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> shone through the clouds of all
reprimands." He added tenderly, "I have also come today to tell
you: Never again shall I wear the stern gaze of censure. I shall
scold you no more."

How much I had missed the chastisements of my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> guru! Each one
had been a guardian angel of protection.

"Dearest Master! Rebuke me a million times-do scold me now!"

"I shall chide you no more." His <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> <span class="t23 hoverable">voice</span> was grave, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> with

Finally we shall merge as one in the Cosmic Beloved; our smiles

Sri Yukteswar gave me <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> on certain matters which I cannot reveal

"I leave you now, beloved one!" At these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> I felt <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> melting

"My child," his <span class="t23 hoverable">voice</span> rang out, vibrating into my very soul-firmament,
"whenever you enter the door of NIRBIKALPA SAMADHI and <span class="t3 t11 t18 t27 hoverable">call</span> on me,
I shall come to you in <span class="t21 hoverable">flesh</span> and blood, even as today."

With this celestial promise Sri Yukteswar vanished from my sight.
A cloud-voice repeated in musical thunder: "Tell all! Whosoever
knows by NIRBIKALPA realization that your <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> is a dream of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span>

Yogananda, tell all!"

Gone was the sorrow of parting. The pity and grief for his death,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> robber of my peace, now fled in stark shame. Bliss poured
forth like a fountain through endless, newly opened soul-pores.
Anciently clogged with disuse, they now widened in purity at the
driving flood of ecstasy. Subconscious thoughts and feelings of my
past incarnations shed their karmic taints, lustrously renewed by
Sri Yukteswar's <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> visit.

I was not the only one privileged to <span class="t0 t6 t7 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t17 t20 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">behold</span> the Resurrected Guru.

One of Sri Yukteswar's chelas was an aged woman, affectionately
known as MA (Mother), <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> home was close to the Puri hermitage.
<span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> had often stopped to chat with her during his morning walk.
On the evening of March 16, 1936, Ma arrived at the ashram and
asked to see her guru.

"Why, <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> died a week ago!" Swami Sebananda, now in charge of
the Puri hermitage, looked at her sadly.

"That's impossible!" She smiled a little. "Perhaps you are just
trying to protect the guru from insistent visitors?"

"No." Sebananda recounted details of the burial. "Come," he said,
"I will <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> you to the front garden to Sri Yukteswarji's grave."

Ma shook her head. "There is no grave for him! This morning at ten
o'clock he passed in his usual walk before my door! I talked to
him for several minutes in the bright outdoors.

"'Come this evening to the ashram,' he said.

"I am here! Blessings pour on this old gray head! The deathless guru
wanted me to understand in what transcendent <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> he had visited
me this morning!"

The astounded Sebananda knelt before her.

"Ma," he said, "what a weight of grief you lift from my heart! He
is risen!"

{FN43-1} In SABIKALPA SAMADHI the devotee has spiritually progressed
to a <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of inward <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> union, but cannot maintain his cosmic
<span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> except in the immobile trance-state. By continuous

lifetrons. The Hindu scriptures refer not only to the ANU, "atom,"
and to the PARAMANU, "beyond the atom," finer electronic energies;
but also to PRANA, "creative lifetronic force." Atoms and electrons
are blind forces; PRANA is inherently intelligent. The pranic
lifetrons in the spermatozoa and ova, for instance, guide the

embryonic development according to a karmic design.

{FN43-3} Adjective of MANTRA, chanted seed-sounds discharged by
the mental gun of concentration. The PURANAS (ancient SHASTRAS or
treatises) describe these MANTRIC wars between DEVAS and ASURAS
(gods and demons). An ASURA once tried to slay a DEVA with a potent
chant. But due to mispronunciation the mental bomb acted as a
boomerang and killed the demon.

CHAPTER: 44

WITH MAHATMA GANDHI AT WARDHA

"Welcome to Wardha!" Mahadev Desai, secretary to Mahatma Gandhi,
greeted Miss Bletch, Mr. Wright, and myself with these cordial <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span>
and the gift of wreaths of KHADDAR (homespun cotton). Our little
group had just dismounted at the Wardha station on an early morning
in August, glad to leave the dust and heat of the train. Consigning
our luggage to a bullock cart, we entered an open motor car with
Mr. Desai and his companions, Babasaheb Deshmukh and Dr. Pingale.
A short drive over the muddy country roads <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> us to MAGANVADI,
the ashram of India's political saint.

Mr. Desai led us at once to the writing room where, cross-legged,
sat Mahatma Gandhi. Pen in one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> and a scrap of paper in the
other, on his face a vast, winning, warm-hearted smile!

"Welcome!" he scribbled in Hindi; it was a Monday, his weekly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span>

of silence.

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Though</span> this was our first meeting, we beamed on each other
affectionately. In 1925 Mahatma Gandhi had honored the Ranchi school
by a visit, and had inscribed in its guest-book a gracious tribute.

The tiny 100-pound saint radiated physical, mental, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span>
health. His soft brown <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> shone with intelligence, sincerity,
and discrimination; this statesman has matched wits and emerged the
victor in a <span class="t15 t23 hoverable">thousand</span> legal, social, and political battles. No other
leader in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> has attained the secure niche in the hearts of
his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> that Gandhi occupies for India's unlettered millions.
Their spontaneous tribute is his famous title-MAHATMA, "great
soul." {FN44-1} For them alone Gandhi confines his attire to the
widely-cartooned loincloth, symbol of his oneness with the downtrodden
masses who can afford no more.

[Illustration: MAHATMA GANDHI, I enjoy a quiet lunch with India's
political saint at his hermitage in Wardha, August, 1935.--see
gandhi.jpg]

"The ashram residents are wholly at your disposal; please <span class="t3 t11 t18 t27 hoverable">call</span> on
them for any service." With characteristic courtesy, the Mahatma
handed me this hastily-written <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">note</span> as Mr. Desai led our party from
the writing room toward the guest house.

Our guide led us through orchards and flowering fields to
a tile-roofed building with latticed windows. A front-yard well,
twenty-five feet across, was used, Mr. Desai said, for watering
stock; near-by stood a revolving cement wheel for threshing rice.
Each of our small bedrooms proved to contain only the irreducible
minimum-a bed, handmade of rope. The whitewashed kitchen boasted a
faucet in one corner and a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> pit for cooking in another. Simple
Arcadian sounds reached our ears-the cries of crows and sparrows,
the lowing of cattle, and the rap of chisels being <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> to chip
stones.

Observing Mr. Wright's travel diary, Mr. Desai opened a page and
wrote on it a list of SATYAGRAHA {FN44-2} vows <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> by all the
Mahatma's strict followers (SATYAGRAHIS):

"Nonviolence; Truth; Non-Stealing; Celibacy; Non-Possession;
Body-Labor; Control of the Palate; Fearlessness; Equal Respect for
all Religions; SWADESHI (use of home manufactures); Freedom from
Untouchability. These eleven should be observed as vows in a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span>
of humility."

(Gandhi himself signed this page on the following day, giving the
date also-August 27, 1935.)

Two hours after our arrival my companions and I were summoned
to lunch. The Mahatma was already seated under the arcade of the
ashram porch, across the courtyard from his study. About twenty-five
barefooted SATYAGRAHIS were squatting before brass cups and plates.
A community chorus of prayer; then a meal served from large brass
pots containing CHAPATIS (whole-wheat unleavened bread) sprinkled
with GHEE; TALSARI (boiled and diced vegetables), and a lemon jam.

The Mahatma ate CHAPATIS, boiled beets, some raw vegetables, and
oranges. On the <span class="t6 hoverable">side</span> of his plate was a large lump of very bitter
NEEM leaves, a notable blood cleanser. With his spoon he separated
a portion and placed it on my dish. I bolted it down with water,
remembering childhood <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">days</span> when Mother had forced me to swallow the
disagreeable dose. Gandhi, however, bit by bit was eating the NEEM
paste with as much relish as if it had been a delicious sweetmeat.

In this trifling incident I noted the Mahatma's ability to detach
his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> from the senses at will. I recalled the famous appendectomy
performed on him some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> ago. Refusing anesthetics, the saint
had chatted cheerfully with his disciples throughout the operation,
his infectious smile revealing his unawareness of pain.

The afternoon <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> an opportunity for a chat with Gandhi's noted
disciple, daughter of an English admiral, Miss Madeleine Slade, now
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Mirabai. {FN44-3} Her strong, calm face lit with enthusiasm

as she told me, in flawless Hindi, of her daily activities.

"Rural reconstruction <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> is rewarding! A group of us go every
morning at five o'clock to serve the near-by villagers and teach
them simple hygiene. We make it a point to clean their latrines and
their mud-thatched huts. The villagers are illiterate; they cannot
be educated except by example!" She laughed gaily.

I looked in admiration at this highborn Englishwoman <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span>
Christian humility enables her to do the scavengering <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> usually
performed only by "untouchables."

"I came to India in 1925," she told me. "In this <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">land</span> I feel that
I have 'come back home.' Now I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> never be willing to return to
my old <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> and old interests."

We discussed America for awhile. "I am always pleased and amazed,"
she said, "to see the deep interest in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> subjects exhibited
by the many Americans who visit India." {FN44-4}

Mirabai's <span class="t13 t23 hoverable">hands</span> were soon busy at the CHARKA (spinning wheel),
omnipresent in all the ashram rooms and, indeed, due to the Mahatma,
omnipresent throughout rural India.

Gandhi has sound economic and cultural reasons for encouraging the

revival of cottage industries, but he does not counsel a fanatical
repudiation of all modern progress. Machinery, trains, automobiles,
the telegraph have played important parts in his own colossal life!
Fifty <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> of public service, in prison and out, wrestling daily
with practical details and harsh realities in the political world,
have only increased his balance, open-mindedness, sanity, and
humorous appreciation of the quaint <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> spectacle.

Our trio enjoyed a six o'clock supper as guests of Babasaheb Deshmukh.
The 7:00 P.M. prayer hour found us back at the MAGANVADI ashram,
climbing to the roof where thirty SATYAGRAHIS were grouped in
a semicircle around Gandhi. He was squatting on a straw mat, an
ancient pocket watch propped up before him. The fading <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> cast
a last gleam over the palms and banyans; the hum of night and the
crickets had started. The atmosphere was serenity itself; I was
enraptured.

A solemn chant led by Mr. Desai, with responses from the group; then
a GITA reading. The Mahatma motioned to me to give the concluding
prayer. Such <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> unison of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> and aspiration! A memory
forever: the Wardha roof top <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> under the early stars.

Punctually at eight o'clock Gandhi ended his silence. The herculean
labors of his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> require him to apportion his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> minutely.

"Welcome, Swamiji!" The Mahatma's greeting this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> was not via
paper. We had just descended from the roof to his writing room,
simply furnished with square mats (no chairs), a low desk with books,
papers, and a few ordinary pens (not fountain pens); a nondescript
clock ticked in a corner. An all-pervasive aura of <span class="t13 hoverable">peace</span> and
devotion. Gandhi was bestowing one of his captivating, cavernous,
almost toothless smiles.

"Years ago," he explained, "I started my weekly observance
of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> of silence as a means for gaining <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> to look after my
correspondence. But now those twenty-four hours have become a vital
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> need. A periodical decree of silence is not a torture
but a blessing."

I agreed wholeheartedly. {FN44-5} The Mahatma questioned me about
America and Europe; we discussed India and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> conditions.

"Mahadev," Gandhi said as Mr. Desai entered the room, "please
make arrangements at Town Hall for Swamiji to <span class="t9 t11 t20 t21 t22 t23 t27 hoverable">speak</span> there on yoga
tomorrow night."

As I was bidding the Mahatma <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> night, he considerately handed
me a bottle of citronella oil.

"The Wardha mosquitoes don't know a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> about AHIMSA, {FN44-6}

Swamiji!" he said, laughing.

The following morning our little group breakfasted early on a tasty
wheat porridge with molasses and milk. At ten-thirty we were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span>
to the ashram porch for lunch with Gandhi and the SATYAGRAHIS.
Today the menu included brown rice, a new selection of vegetables,
and cardamom seeds.

Noon found me strolling about the ashram grounds, on to the grazing
<span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">land</span> of a few imperturbable cows. The protection of cows is a
passion with Gandhi.

"The cow to me means the entire sub-human world, extending man's
sympathies beyond his own species," the Mahatma has explained. "Man
through the cow is enjoined to realize his identity with all that
lives. Why the ancient rishis selected the cow for apotheosis is
obvious to me. The cow in India was the best comparison; she was
the giver of plenty. Not only did she give milk, but she also made
agriculture possible. The cow is a poem of pity; one reads pity in
the gentle animal. She is the <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> mother to millions of mankind.
Protection of the cow means protection of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> dumb <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span>
of God. The appeal of the lower <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span> is all the more
forceful because it is speechless."

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Three</span> daily rituals are enjoined on the orthodox Hindu. One is BHUTA

YAJNA, an <span class="t22 t23 t28 hoverable">offering</span> of <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> to the animal kingdom. This ceremony
symbolizes man's realization of his obligations to less evolved
forms of creation, instinctively tied to bodily identifications which
also corrode <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> life, but lacking in that quality of liberating
<span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> which is peculiar to humanity. BHUTA YAJNA <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> reinforces
man's readiness to succor the weak, as he in turn is comforted by
countless solicitudes of <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> unseen beings. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Man</span> is also under
bond for rejuvenating gifts of nature, prodigal in earth, sea, and
sky. The evolutionary barrier of incommunicability among nature,
animals, man, and astral angels is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> overcome by offices of
silent love.

The other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> daily YAJNAS are PITRI and NRI. PITRI YAJNA is an <span class="t22 t23 t28 hoverable">offering</span>
of oblations to ancestors, as a symbol of man's acknowledgment of
his debt to the past, essence of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> <span class="t12 t20 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">wisdom</span> illumines humanity
today. NRI YAJNA is an <span class="t22 t23 t28 hoverable">offering</span> of <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> to strangers or the poor,
symbol of the present responsibilities of man, his duties to
contemporaries.

In the early afternoon I fulfilled a neighborly NRI YAJNA by a
visit to Gandhi's ashram for little girls. Mr. Wright accompanied
me on the ten-minute drive. Tiny young flowerlike faces atop the
long-stemmed colorful SARIS! At the end of a brief talk in Hindi
{FN44-7} which I was giving outdoors, the skies unloosed a sudden
downpour. Laughing, Mr. Wright and I climbed aboard the car and

sped back to MAGANVADI amidst sheets of driving silver. Such tropical
intensity and splash!

Reentering the guest <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> I was struck anew by the stark simplicity
and evidences of self-sacrifice which are everywhere present.
The Gandhi vow of non-possession came early in his married life.
Renouncing an extensive legal practice which had been yielding him
an annual income of more than $20,000, the Mahatma dispersed all
his wealth to the poor.

Sri Yukteswar <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> to poke gentle fun at the commonly inadequate
conceptions of renunciation.

"A beggar cannot renounce wealth," <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> say. "If a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> laments:
'My business has failed; my wife has <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> me; I will renounce all
and enter a monastery,' to what worldly <span class="t2 t9 t10 t16 t18 t19 t27 t28 hoverable">sacrifice</span> is he referring?
He did not renounce wealth and love; they renounced him!"

Saints like Gandhi, on the other hand, have made not only tangible
material sacrifices, but also the more difficult renunciation of
selfish motive and private goal, merging their inmost being in the
stream of humanity as a whole.

The Mahatma's remarkable wife, Kasturabai, did not <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> when he
failed to <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> aside any part of his wealth for the <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> of herself

and their children. Married in early youth, Gandhi and his wife
<span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> the vow of celibacy after the birth of several sons. {FN44-8}
A tranquil heroine in the intense drama that has been their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span>
together, Kasturabai has followed her husband to prison, shared
his three-week fasts, and fully borne her share of his endless
responsibilities. She has paid Gandhi the following tribute:

I thank you for having had the privilege of being your lifelong
companion and helpmate. I thank you for the most perfect marriage
in the world, based on BRAHMACHARYA (self-control) and not on sex.
I thank you for having considered me your equal in your <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span>
for India. I thank you for not being one of those husbands who spend
their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> in gambling, racing, women, wine, and song, tiring of
their wives and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">children</span> as the little boy quickly tires of his
childhood toys. How thankful I am that you were not one of those
husbands who devote their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> to growing rich on the exploitation
of the labor of others.

How thankful I am that you put <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> and country before bribes, that
you had the courage of your convictions and a complete and implicit
<span class="t4 t7 t12 t16 hoverable">faith</span> in God. How thankful I am for a husband that put <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> and his
country before me. I am grateful to you for your tolerance of me
and my shortcomings of youth, when I grumbled and rebelled against
the change you made in our mode of living, from so much to so
little.

As a young child, I lived in your parents' home; your mother was a
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> woman; she trained me, taught me how to be a brave,
courageous wife and how to keep the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t8 t13 t15 t17 t18 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> and respect of her son,
my future husband. As the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> passed and you became India's most
beloved leader, I had none of the fears that beset the wife who may
be cast aside when her husband has climbed the ladder of success,
as so often happens in other countries. I knew that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">death</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span>
still <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> us husband and wife.

For <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> Kasturabai performed the duties of treasurer of the public
funds which the idolized Mahatma is able to raise by the millions.
There are many humorous stories in Indian homes to the effect that
husbands are nervous about their wives' wearing any jewelry to
a Gandhi meeting; the Mahatma's magical tongue, pleading for the
downtrodden, charms the gold bracelets and diamond necklaces right
off the arms and necks of the wealthy into the collection basket!

One <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> the public treasurer, Kasturabai, could not <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> for a
disbursement of four rupees. Gandhi duly published an auditing in
which he inexorably pointed out his wife's four rupee discrepancy.

I had often told this story before classes of my American students.
One evening a woman in the hall had given an outraged gasp.

"Mahatma or no Mahatma," she had cried, "if he were my husband
I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have given him a black eye for such an unnecessary public
insult!"

After some good-humored banter had passed between us on the subject of
American wives and Hindu wives, I had gone on to a fuller explanation.

"Mrs. Gandhi considers the Mahatma not as her husband but as her
guru, one who has the right to discipline her for even insignificant
errors," I had pointed out. "Sometime after Kasturabai had been
publicly rebuked, Gandhi was sentenced to prison on a political
charge. As he was calmly bidding farewell to his wife, she fell at
his feet. 'Master,' she said humbly, 'if I have ever offended you,
please forgive me.'" {FN44-9}

At <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> o'clock that afternoon in Wardha, I betook myself,
by previous appointment, to the writing room of the saint who had
been able to make an unflinching disciple out of his own wife-rare
miracle! Gandhi looked up with his unforgettable smile.

"Mahatmaji," I said as I squatted beside him on the uncushioned
mat, "please tell me your definition of AHIMSA."

"The avoidance of harm to any living creature in <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> or deed."

"Beautiful ideal! But the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> will always ask: May one not kill
a cobra to protect a child, or one's self?"

"I could not kill a cobra <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> violating <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> of my vows--fearlessness,
and non-killing. I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> rather try inwardly to calm the snake by
vibrations of love. I cannot possibly lower my standards to suit
my circumstances." With his amazing candor, Gandhi added, "I must
confess that I could not carry on this conversation were I faced
by a cobra!"

I remarked on several very recent Western books on diet which lay
on his desk.

"Yes, diet is important in the SATYAGRAHA movement-as everywhere
else," he said with a chuckle. "Because I advocate complete continence
for SATYAGRAHIS, I am always trying to <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> out the best diet for
the celibate. One must conquer the palate before he can control the
procreative instinct. Semi-starvation or unbalanced diets are not
the answer. After overcoming the inward GREED for food, a SATYAGRAHI
must continue to follow a rational vegetarian diet with all necessary
vitamins, minerals, calories, and so forth. By inward and outward
<span class="t12 t20 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">wisdom</span> in regard to eating, the SATYAGRAHI'S sexual fluid is easily
turned into vital energy for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> body."

The Mahatma and I compared our <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> meat-substitutes.

"The avocado is excellent," I said. "There are numerous avocado
groves near my center in California."

Gandhi's face lit with interest. "I wonder if they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> grow in
Wardha? The SATYAGRAHIS <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> appreciate a new food."

"I will be sure to send some avocado plants from Los Angeles to
Wardha." {FN44-10} I added, "Eggs are a high-protein food; are they
forbidden to SATYAGRAHIS?"

"Not unfertilized eggs." The Mahatma laughed reminiscently. "For
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> not countenance their use; even now I personally
do not <span class="t28 hoverable">eat</span> them. One of my daughters-in-law was once dying of
malnutrition; her doctor insisted on eggs. I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> not agree, and
advised him to give her some egg-substitute.

"'Gandhiji,' the doctor said, 'unfertilized eggs contain no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span>
sperm; no killing is involved.'

"I then gladly gave permission for my daughter-in-law to <span class="t28 hoverable">eat</span> eggs;
she was soon restored to health."

On the previous night Gandhi had expressed a wish to receive
the KRIYA YOGA of Lahiri Mahasaya. I was touched by the Mahatma's
open-mindedness and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> of inquiry. He is childlike in his

divine quest, revealing that pure receptivity which <span class="t0 t6 t8 t9 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t22 t23 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Jesus</span> praised
in children, ". . . of such is the kingdom of heaven."

The hour for my promised instruction had arrived; several SATYAGRAHIS
now entered the room-Mr. Desai, Dr. Pingale, and a few others who
desired the KRIYA technique.

I first taught the little class the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> YOGODA exercises. The
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> is visualized as divided into twenty parts; the will directs
energy in turn to each section. Soon everyone was vibrating before
me like a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> motor. It was easy to observe the rippling effect
on Gandhi's twenty <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> parts, at all times completely exposed to
view! <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Though</span> very thin, he is not unpleasingly so; the skin of
his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> is smooth and unwrinkled.

Later I initiated the group into the liberating technique of KRIYA
YOGA.

The Mahatma has reverently studied all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> religions. The
Jain scriptures, the Biblical New Testament, and the sociological
writings of Tolstoy {FN44-11} are the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> main sources of Gandhi's
nonviolent convictions. He has stated his credo thus:

I believe the Bible, the KORAN, and the ZEND-AVESTA {FN44-12} to
be as divinely inspired as the VEDAS. I believe in the institution

of Gurus, but in this age millions must go <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> a Guru, because
it is a rare <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> to <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> a combination of perfect purity and
perfect learning. But one need not despair of ever knowing the
<span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> of one's religion, because the fundamentals of Hinduism as
of every <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> religion are unchangeable, and easily understood.

I believe like every Hindu in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> and His oneness, in rebirth and
salvation. . . . I can no more describe my feeling for Hinduism
than for my own wife. She moves me as no other woman in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span>
can. Not that she has no faults; I daresay she has many more than
I see myself. But the feeling of an indissoluble bond is there.
Even so I feel for and about Hinduism with all its faults and
limitations. Nothing delights me so much as the music of the GITA,
or the RAMAYANA by Tulsidas. When I fancied I was taking my last
breath, the GITA was my solace.

Hinduism is not an exclusive religion. In it there is room for
the worship of all the prophets of the world. {FN44-13} It is not
a missionary religion in the ordinary <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> of the term. It has
no doubt absorbed many tribes in its fold, but this absorption has
been of an evolutionary, imperceptible character. Hinduism tells
each <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> to worship <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> according to his own <span class="t4 t7 t12 t16 hoverable">faith</span> or DHARMA,
{FN44-14} and so lives at <span class="t13 hoverable">peace</span> with all religions.

Of Christ, Gandhi has written: "I am sure that if He were living

have never even <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> His name . . . just as it is written: 'Not

solely to Christianity, but to the entire world, to all lands and

On my last evening in Wardha I addressed the meeting which had
been <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> by Mr. Desai in Town Hall. The room was thronged to
the window sills with about 400 <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> assembled to hear the talk
on yoga. I spoke first in Hindi, then in English. Our little group
returned to the ashram in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> for a good-night glimpse of Gandhi,
enfolded in <span class="t13 hoverable">peace</span> and correspondence.

Night was still lingering when I rose at 5:00 A.M. Village <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> was
already stirring; first a bullock cart by the ashram gates, then
a peasant with his huge burden balanced precariously on his head.
After breakfast our trio sought out Gandhi for farewell PRONAMS.
The saint rises at four o'clock for his morning prayer.

"Mahatmaji, good-by!" I knelt to touch his feet. "India is safe in
your keeping!"

Years have rolled by since the Wardha idyl; the earth, oceans, and
skies have darkened with a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> at war. Alone among <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> leaders,
Gandhi has offered a practical nonviolent alternative to armed
might. To redress grievances and remove injustices, the Mahatma
has employed nonviolent means which again and again have proved
their effectiveness. He states his doctrine in these words:

I have found that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> persists in the midst of destruction.
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Therefore</span> there must be a <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">law</span> than that of destruction. Only
under that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">law</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> well-ordered <span class="t1 hoverable">society</span> be intelligible and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span>
worth living.

If that is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">law</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> we must <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> it out in daily existence.
Wherever there are wars, wherever we are confronted with an opponent,
conquer by love. I have found that the certain <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">law</span> of <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t8 t13 t15 t17 t18 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> has
answered in my own <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">law</span> of destruction has never done.

In India we have had an ocular demonstration of the operation of
this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">law</span> on the widest scale possible. I don't claim that nonviolence
has penetrated the 360,000,000 <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> in India, but I do claim
it has penetrated deeper than any other doctrine in an incredibly
short time.

It takes a fairly strenuous course of training to attain a mental
<span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of nonviolence. It is a disciplined life, like the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of

a soldier. The perfect <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> is reached only when the mind, body,
and speech are in proper coordination. Every problem <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> lend
itself to solution if we determined to make the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">law</span> of <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> and
nonviolence the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">law</span> of life.

Just as a scientist will <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> wonders out of various applications
of the laws of nature, a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> who applies the laws of <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t8 t13 t15 t17 t18 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> with

infinitely more wonderful and subtle than forces of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> like,
for instance, electricity. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">law</span> of <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t8 t13 t15 t17 t18 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> is a far greater science
than any modern science.

Consulting history, one may reasonably <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> that the problems of
mankind have not been solved by the <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> of brute force. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">World</span> War
I produced a world-chilling snowball of war karma that swelled into
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">World</span> War II. Only the warmth of brotherhood can melt the present
colossal snowball of war karma which may otherwise grow into <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">World</span>
War III. This unholy trinity will banish forever the possibility
of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">World</span> War IV by a finality of atomic bombs. <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">Use</span> of jungle logic
instead of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> in settling disputes will restore the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span>
to a jungle. If brothers not in life, then brothers in violent
death.

War and crime never pay. The billions of dollars that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> up in
the smoke of explosive nothingness <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have been sufficient to

have made a new world, one almost <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> from disease and completely
<span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> from poverty. Not an <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> of fear, chaos, famine, pestilence,
the DANSE MACABRE, but one broad <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">land</span> of peace, of prosperity, and
of widening knowledge.

The nonviolent <span class="t23 hoverable">voice</span> of Gandhi appeals to man's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> conscience.
Let nations ally themselves no longer with death, but with life; not
with destruction, but with construction; not with the Annihilator,
but with the Creator.

"One should forgive, under any injury," says the MAHABHARATA. "It
<span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hath</span> been said that the continuation of species is due to man's being
forgiving. Forgiveness is holiness; by forgiveness the universe is
held together. Forgiveness is the might of the mighty; forgiveness is
sacrifice; forgiveness is quiet of mind. Forgiveness and gentleness
are the qualities of the self-possessed. They represent <span class="t20 hoverable">eternal</span>
virtue."

Nonviolence is the natural outgrowth of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">law</span> of forgiveness and
love. "If loss of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> becomes necessary in a righteous battle,"
Gandhi proclaims, "one should be prepared, like Jesus, to shed his
own, not others', blood. Eventually there will be less blood spilt
in the world."

Epics shall someday be <span class="t0 t11 t24 hoverable">written</span> on the Indian SATYAGRAHIS who withstood

hate with love, violence with nonviolence, who allowed themselves
to be mercilessly slaughtered rather than retaliate. The result on
certain historic occasions was that the armed opponents threw down
their guns and fled, shamed, shaken to their depths by the sight
of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> who valued the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of another above their own.

"I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> wait, if need be for ages," Gandhi says, "rather than
seek the freedom of my country through bloody means." Never does
the Mahatma forget the majestic warning: "All they that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> the
sword shall perish with the sword." {FN44-16} Gandhi has written:

I <span class="t3 t11 t18 t27 hoverable">call</span> myself a nationalist, but my nationalism is as broad as the
universe. It includes in its sweep all the nations of the earth.
{FN44-17} My nationalism includes the well-being of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> world.
I do not want my India to rise on the ashes of other nations. I
do not want India to exploit a single <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> being. I want India to
be strong in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> that she can infect the other nations also with
her strength. Not so with a single nation in Europe today; they do
not give strength to the others.

President Wilson mentioned his beautiful fourteen points, but said:
"After all, if this endeavor of ours to arrive at <span class="t13 hoverable">peace</span> fails,
we have our armaments to fall back upon." I want to reverse that
position, and I say: "Our armaments have failed already. Let us
now be in search of something new; let us try the force of <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t8 t13 t15 t17 t18 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> and

God which is truth." When we have got that, we shall want nothing
else.

By the Mahatma's training of thousands of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> SATYAGRAHIS (those
who have <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> the eleven rigorous vows mentioned in the first part
of this chapter), who in turn spread the message; by patiently
educating the Indian masses to understand the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> and
eventually material benefits of nonviolence; by arming his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span>
with nonviolent weapons--non-cooperation with injustice, the willingness
to endure indignities, prison, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">death</span> itself rather than resort to
arms; by enlisting <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> sympathy through countless examples of
heroic martyrdom among SATYAGRAHIS, Gandhi has dramatically portrayed
the practical <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of nonviolence, its solemn <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> to settle
disputes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> war.

Gandhi has already won through nonviolent means a greater <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span>
of political concessions for his <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">land</span> than have ever been won by
any leader of any country except through bullets. Nonviolent methods
for eradication of all wrongs and evils have been strikingly applied
not only in the political arena but in the delicate and complicated
field of Indian social reform. Gandhi and his followers have removed
many longstanding feuds between Hindus and Mohammedans; hundreds
of thousands of Moslems look to the Mahatma as their leader.
The untouchables have found in him their fearless and triumphant

champion. "If there be a rebirth in store for me," Gandhi wrote,
"I wish to be <span class="t16 t24 hoverable">born</span> a pariah in the midst of pariahs, because thereby
I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be able to render them more effective service."

The Mahatma is indeed a "great soul," but it was illiterate millions
who had the discernment to bestow the title. This gentle prophet
is honored in his own land. The lowly peasant has been able to rise
to Gandhi's <span class="t23 hoverable">high</span> challenge. The Mahatma wholeheartedly believes in
the inherent nobility of man. The inevitable failures have never
disillusioned him. "Even if the opponent plays him false twenty times,"
he writes, "the SATYAGRAHI is ready to trust him the twenty-first
time, for an implicit trust in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> is the very essence of
the creed." {FN44-18}

"Mahatmaji, you are an exceptional man. You must not expect the

"It is curious how we delude ourselves, fancying that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> can
be improved, but that it is impossible to evoke the hidden powers
of the soul," Gandhi replied. "I am engaged in trying to show that
if I have any of those powers, I am as frail a mortal as any of
us and that I never had anything extraordinary about me nor have I
now. I am a simple individual liable to err like any other fellow
mortal. I own, however, that I have enough humility to confess
my errors and to retrace my steps. I own that I have an immovable

faith in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> and His goodness, and an unconsumable passion for <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span>
and love. But is that not what every <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> has latent in him? If
we are to make progress, we must not repeat history but make new
history. We must add to the inheritance <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> by our ancestors. If we
may make new discoveries and inventions in the phenomenal world,

Americans may <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> remember with pride the successful nonviolent
experiment of William Penn in founding his 17th century colony in
Pennsylvania. There were "no forts, no soldiers, no militia, even
no arms." Amidst the savage frontier wars and the butcheries that
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> on between the new settlers and the Red Indians, the Quakers
of Pennsylvania alone remained unmolested. "Others were slain; others
were massacred; but they were safe. Not a Quaker woman suffered
assault; not a Quaker child was slain, not a Quaker <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> was tortured."
When the Quakers were finally forced to give up the government of
the state, "war broke out, and some Pennsylvanians were killed. But

Franklin D. Roosevelt has pointed out. "Victory and defeat were
alike sterile. That lesson the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> should have learned."

"The more weapons of violence, the more misery to mankind," Lao-tzu
taught. "The triumph of violence ends in a festival of mourning."

"I am fighting for nothing less than <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> peace," Gandhi
has declared. "If the Indian movement is carried to success on a
nonviolent SATYAGRAHA basis, it will give a new <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> to patriotism

Before the West dismisses Gandhi's program as one of an impractical
dreamer, let it first reflect on a definition of SATYAGRAHA by the
<span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> of Galilee:

"Ye have <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> that it <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hath</span> been said, An eye for an eye, and

Gandhi's epoch has extended, with the beautiful precision of
cosmic timing, into a century already desolated and devastated by

MAHATMA GANDHI'S HANDWRITING IN HINDI

[Illustration--see gandhi2.jpg]

Mahatma Gandhi visited my <span class="t23 hoverable">high</span> school with yoga training at Ranchi.
He graciously wrote the above lines in the Ranchi guest-book. The
translation is: "This institution has deeply impressed my mind.
I cherish <span class="t23 hoverable">high</span> hopes that this school will encourage the further
practical <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> of the spinning wheel."

(SIGNED) MOHANDAS GANDHI September 17, 1925

[Illustration--see gandhiflag.jpg]

A national flag for India was designed in 1921 by Gandhi. The
stripes are saffron, white and green; the CHARKA (spinning wheel)
in the center is dark blue. "The CHARKA symbolizes energy,"
he wrote, "and reminds us that during the past eras of prosperity
in India's history, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> spinning and other domestic crafts were
prominent."

{FN44-1} His family name is Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi. He never
refers to himself as "Mahatma."

{FN44-2} The literal translation from Sanskrit is "holding to
truth." SATYAGRAHA is the famous nonviolence movement led by Gandhi.

{FN44-3} False and alas! malicious reports were recently circulated
that Miss Slade has severed all her ties with Gandhi and forsaken
her vows. Miss Slade, the Mahatma's SATYAGRAHA disciple for twenty
years, issued a signed statement to the UNITED PRESS, dated Dec.
29, 1945, in which she explained that a series of baseless rumors
arose after she had departed, with Gandhi's blessings, for a small
site in northeastern India near the Himalayas, for the purpose of
founding there her now-flourishing KISAN ASHRAM (center for medical
and agricultural aid to peasant farmers). Mahatma Gandhi plans to
visit the new ashram during 1946.

{FN44-4} Miss Slade reminded me of another distinguished Western
woman, Miss Margaret Woodrow Wilson, eldest daughter of America's
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> president. I met her in New York; she was intensely interested
in India. Later she <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> to Pondicherry, where she spent the last
five <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> of her life, happily pursuing a path of discipline at
the feet of Sri Aurobindo Ghosh. This sage never speaks; he silently
greets his disciples on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> annual occasions only.

{FN44-5} For <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> in America I had been observing periods of
silence, to the consternation of callers and secretaries.

{FN44-6} Harmlessness; nonviolence; the foundation rock of Gandhi's
creed. He was <span class="t16 t24 hoverable">born</span> into a family of strict Jains, who revere AHIMSA

as the root-virtue. Jainism, a sect of Hinduism, was founded in the
6th century B.C. by Mahavira, a contemporary of Buddha. Mahavira
means "great hero"; may he look down the centuries on his heroic
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> Gandhi!

{FN44-7} Hindi is the lingua franca for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> of India. An
Indo-Aryan language based largely on Sanskrit roots, Hindi is the
chief vernacular of northern India. The main dialect of Western
Hindi is Hindustani, <span class="t0 t11 t24 hoverable">written</span> both in the DEVANAGARI (Sanskrit)
characters and in Arabic characters. Its subdialect, Urdu, is spoken
by Moslems.

{FN44-8} Gandhi has described his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> with a devastating candor

Press, 1927-29, 2 vol.) This autobiography has been summarized in
MAHATMA GANDHI, HIS OWN STORY, edited by C. F. Andrews, with an
introduction by John Haynes Holmes (New York: Macmillan Co., 1930).

Many autobiographies replete with famous names and colorful
events are almost completely silent on any phase of inner analysis
or development. One lays down each of these books with a certain
dissatisfaction, as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> saying: "Here is a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> who knew many
notable persons, but who never knew himself." This reaction is
impossible with Gandhi's autobiography; he exposes his faults and
subterfuges with an impersonal devotion to <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> rare in annals of

any age.

{FN44-9} Kasturabai Gandhi died in imprisonment at Poona on February
22, 1944. The usually unemotional Gandhi wept silently. Shortly
after her admirers had suggested a Memorial Fund in her honor, 125
lacs of rupees (nearly four million dollars) poured in from all
over India. Gandhi has arranged that the fund be <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> for village
welfare <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> among women and children. He reports his activities

CHAPTER: 45

THE BENGALI "JOY-PERMEATED" MOTHER

"Sir, please do not leave India <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> a glimpse of Nirmala Devi.
Her sanctity is intense; she is known far and wide as Ananda Moyi Ma
(Joy-Permeated Mother)." My niece, Amiyo Bose, gazed at me earnestly.

"Of course! I want very much to see the woman saint." I added, "I

have read of her advanced <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of God-realization. A little article
about her appeared <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> ago in EAST-WEST."

"I have met her," Amiyo <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> on. "She recently visited my own little
town of Jamshedpur. At the entreaty of a disciple, Ananda Moyi Ma
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> to the home of a dying man. She stood by his bedside; as her
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> touched his forehead, his death-rattle ceased. The disease
vanished at once; to the man's glad astonishment, he was well."

A few <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">days</span> later I <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> that the Blissful Mother was staying at
the home of a disciple in the Bhowanipur section of Calcutta. Mr.
Wright and I <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> out immediately from my father's Calcutta home. As
the Ford neared the Bhowanipur house, my companion and I observed
an unusual street scene.

Ananda Moyi Ma was standing in an open-topped automobile, blessing
a throng of about one hundred disciples. She was evidently on the
point of departure. Mr. Wright parked the Ford some distance away,
and accompanied me on foot toward the quiet assemblage. The woman
saint glanced in our direction; she alit from her car and walked
toward us.

"Father, you have come!" With these fervent <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> she put her arm
around my neck and her <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> on my shoulder. Mr. Wright, to whom I
had just remarked that I did not know the saint, was hugely enjoying

this extraordinary demonstration of welcome. The <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> of the one
hundred chelas were also fixed with some surprise on the affectionate
tableau.

I had instantly seen that the saint was in a <span class="t23 hoverable">high</span> <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of SAMADHI.
Utterly oblivious to her outward garb as a woman, she knew herself
as the changeless soul; from that plane she was joyously greeting
another devotee of God. She led me by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> into her automobile.

"Ananda Moyi Ma, I am delaying your journey!" I protested.

"Father, I am meeting you for the first <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> in this life, after
ages!" she said. "Please do not leave yet."

We sat <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> in the rear seats of the car. The Blissful Mother
soon entered the immobile ecstatic state. Her beautiful <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span>
glanced heavenward and, half-opened, became stilled, gazing into
the near-far inner Elysium. The disciples chanted gently: "Victory
to Mother Divine!"

I had found many <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> of God-realization in India, but never before
had I met such an exalted woman saint. Her gentle face was burnished
with the ineffable joy that had given her the name of Blissful
Mother. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Long</span> black tresses lay loosely behind her unveiled head. A
red dot of sandalwood paste on her forehead symbolized the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span>

eye, ever open <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> her. Tiny face, tiny hands, tiny feet-a
contrast to her <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> magnitude!

I put some questions to a near-by woman chela while Ananda Moyi Ma
remained entranced.

"The Blissful Mother travels widely in India; in many parts she has
hundreds of disciples," the chela told me. "Her courageous efforts
have <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> about many desirable social reforms. Although a Brahmin,
the saint recognizes no caste distinctions. {FN45-1} A group of
us always travel with her, looking after her comforts. We have to
mother her; she takes no notice of her body. If no one gave her
food, she <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> not eat, or make any inquiries. Even when meals
are placed before her, she does not touch them. To prevent her
disappearance from this world, we disciples feed her with our own
hands. For <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">days</span> <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> she often stays in the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> trance,
scarcely breathing, her <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> unwinking. One of her chief disciples
is her husband. Many <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> ago, soon after their marriage, he <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span>
the vow of silence."

The chela pointed to a broad-shouldered, fine-featured <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> with
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> hair and hoary beard. He was standing quietly in the midst of
the gathering, his <span class="t13 t23 hoverable">hands</span> folded in a disciple's reverential attitude.

Refreshed by her dip in the Infinite, Ananda Moyi Ma was now focusing

her <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> on the material world.

"Father, please tell me where you stay." Her <span class="t23 hoverable">voice</span> was clear and
melodious.

"At present, in Calcutta or Ranchi; but soon I shall be returning
to America."

"America?"

"Yes. An Indian woman saint <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be sincerely appreciated there
by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> seekers. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Would</span> you like to go?"

"If <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Father</span> can <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> me, I will go."

This reply caused her near-by disciples to start in alarm.

"Twenty or more of us always travel with the Blissful Mother," one
of them told me firmly. "We could not live <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> her. Wherever
she goes, we must go."

Reluctantly I abandoned the plan, as possessing an impractical
feature of spontaneous enlargement!

"Please come at least to Ranchi, with your disciples," I said on

taking leave of the saint. "As a <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> child yourself, you will
enjoy the little ones in my school."

"Whenever <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Father</span> takes me, I will gladly go."

A short <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> later the Ranchi VIDYALAYA was in gala array for the
saint's promised visit. The youngsters looked forward to any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span>
of festivity-no lessons, hours of music, and a feast for the climax!

"Victory! Ananda Moyi Ma, ki jai!" This reiterated chant from
scores of enthusiastic little throats greeted the saint's party
as it entered the school gates. Showers of marigolds, tinkle of
cymbals, lusty blowing of conch shells and beat of the MRIDANGA
drum! The Blissful Mother wandered smilingly over the sunny VIDYALAYA
grounds, ever carrying <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> her the portable paradise.

"It is beautiful here," Ananda Moyi Ma said graciously as I led her
into the main building. She seated herself with a childlike smile
by my side. The closest of dear friends, she made one feel, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> an
aura of remoteness was ever around her-the paradoxical isolation
of Omnipresence.

"Please tell me something of your life."

"Father knows all about it; why repeat it?" She evidently felt that

the factual history of one short incarnation was beneath notice.

I laughed, gently repeating my question.

"Father, there is little to tell." She spread her graceful <span class="t13 t23 hoverable">hands</span>
in a deprecatory gesture. "My <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> has never associated
itself with this temporary body. Before I came on this earth, Father,
'I was the same.' As a little girl, 'I was the same.' I grew into
womanhood, but still 'I was the same.' When the family in which
I had been <span class="t16 t24 hoverable">born</span> made arrangements to have this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> married, 'I
was the same.' And when, passion-drunk, my husband came to me and
murmured endearing words, lightly touching my body, he received a
violent shock, as if struck by lightning, for even then 'I was the
same.'

"My husband knelt before me, folded his hands, and implored my
pardon.

"'Mother,' he said, 'because I have desecrated your bodily temple
by touching it with the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> of lust-not knowing that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> it
dwelt not my wife but the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Mother-I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> this solemn vow: I
shall be your disciple, a celibate follower, ever caring for you
in silence as a servant, never speaking to anyone again as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> as
I live. May I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> atone for the <span class="t0 t9 t11 t14 t17 t28 hoverable">sin</span> I have today committed against
you, my guru.'

"Even when I quietly accepted this proposal of my husband's, 'I
was the same.' And, Father, in front of you now, 'I am the same.'
Ever afterward, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> the dance of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span> change around me in
the hall of eternity, 'I shall be the same.'"

Ananda Moyi Ma sank into a deep meditative state. Her <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> was
statue-still; she had fled to her ever-calling kingdom. The dark
pools of her <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> appeared lifeless and glassy. This expression
is often present when saints remove their <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> from the
<span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> body, which is then hardly more than a piece of soulless
clay. We sat <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> for an hour in the ecstatic trance. She
returned to this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> with a gay little laugh.

"Please, Ananda Moyi Ma," I said, "come with me to the garden. Mr.
Wright will <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> some pictures."

"Of course, Father. Your will is my will." Her glorious <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> retained
the unchanging <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> luster as she posed for many photographs.

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Time</span> for the feast! Ananda Moyi Ma squatted on her blanket-seat,
a disciple at her elbow to feed her. Like an infant, the saint
obediently swallowed the <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> after the chela had <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> it to
her lips. It was plain that the Blissful Mother did not recognize
any difference between curries and sweetmeats!

As dusk approached, the saint <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> with her party amidst a shower
of rose petals, her <span class="t13 t23 hoverable">hands</span> raised in blessing on the little lads.
Their faces shone with the affection she had effortlessly awakened.

"Thou <span class="t0 t6 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shalt</span> <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t8 t13 t15 t17 t18 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thy</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> with all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thy</span> heart, and with all

has proclaimed, "this is the first commandment." {FN45-2}

Casting aside every inferior attachment, Ananda Moyi Ma offers her
sole allegiance to the Lord. Not by the hairsplitting distinctions
of scholars but by the sure logic of faith, the childlike saint has
solved the only problem in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> life-establishment of unity with
God. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Man</span> has forgotten this stark simplicity, now befogged by a
million issues. Refusing a monotheistic <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t8 t13 t15 t17 t18 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> to God, the nations
disguise their infidelity by punctilious respect before the outward
shrines of charity. These humanitarian gestures are virtuous, because
for a moment they divert man's attention from himself, but they do
not <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> him from his single responsibility in life, referred to
by <span class="t0 t6 t8 t9 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t22 t23 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Jesus</span> as the first commandment. The uplifting obligation to <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t8 t13 t15 t17 t18 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span>
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> is assumed with man's first breath of an air freely bestowed
by his only Benefactor.

On one other occasion after her Ranchi visit I had opportunity to
see Ananda Moyi Ma. She stood among her disciples some months later

on the Serampore station platform, waiting for the train.

"Father, I am going to the Himalayas," she told me. "Generous
disciples have built me a hermitage in Dehra Dun."

As she boarded the train, I marveled to see that <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> amidst a
crowd, on a train, feasting, or sitting in silence, her <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> never
looked away from God. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">Within</span> me I still hear her voice, an echo of
measureless sweetness:

"Behold, now and always one with the Eternal, 'I am ever the same.'"

{FN45-1} I <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> some further facts of Ananda Moyi Ma's life, printed
in EAST-WEST. The saint was <span class="t16 t24 hoverable">born</span> in 1893 at Dacca in central Bengal.
Illiterate, she has <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> stunned the intellectuals by her wisdom.
Her verses in Sanskrit have filled scholars with wonderment. She
has <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> consolation to bereaved persons, and effected miraculous
cures, by her mere presence.

CHAPTER: 46

THE WOMAN YOGI WHO NEVER EATS

"Sir, whither are we bound this morning?" Mr. Wright was driving
the Ford; he <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> his <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> off the road <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> enough to gaze at me
with a questioning twinkle. From <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> he seldom knew what
part of Bengal he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be discovering next.

"God willing," I replied devoutly, "we are on our <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> to see an
eighth wonder of the world-a woman saint <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> diet is thin air!"

"Repetition of wonders-after Therese Neumann." But Mr. Wright laughed
eagerly just the same; he even accelerated the speed of the car.
More extraordinary grist for his travel diary! Not one of an average
tourist, that!

The Ranchi school had just been <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> behind us; we had risen before
the sun. Besides my secretary and myself, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> Bengali friends
were in the party. We drank in the exhilarating air, the natural
wine of the morning. Our driver guided the car warily among the
early peasants and the two-wheeled carts, slowly drawn by yoked,
hump-shouldered bullocks, inclined to dispute the road with a
honking interloper.

"Sir, we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> like to know more of the fasting saint."

"Her name is Giri Bala," I informed my companions. "I first <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span>
about her <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> ago from a scholarly gentleman, Sthiti Lal Nundy.
He often came to the Gurpar Road home to tutor my brother Bishnu."

"'I know Giri Bala well,' Sthiti Babu told me. 'She employs a
certain yoga technique which enables her to live <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> eating. I
was her close neighbor in Nawabganj near Ichapur. {FN46-1} I made
it a point to watch her closely; never did I <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> evidence that
she was taking either <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> or drink. My interest finally mounted so
<span class="t23 hoverable">high</span> that I approached the Maharaja of Burdwan {FN46-2} and asked
him to conduct an investigation. Astounded at the story, he invited
her to his palace. She agreed to a test and lived for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> months
locked up in a small section of his home. Later she returned for a
palace visit of twenty days; and then for a <span class="t7 hoverable">third</span> test of fifteen
days. The Maharaja himself told me that these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> rigorous
scrutinies had convinced him beyond doubt of her non-eating state.'

"This story of Sthiti Babu's has remained in my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> for over
twenty-five years," I concluded. "Sometimes in America I wondered
if the river of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> not swallow the YOGINI {FN46-3} before
I could meet her. She must be quite aged now. I do not even know
where, or if, she lives. But in a few hours we shall reach Purulia;
her brother has a home there."

By ten-thirty our little group was conversing with the brother,

Lambadar Dey, a lawyer of Purulia.

"Yes, my sister is living. She sometimes stays with me here, but at
present she is at our family home in Biur." Lambadar Babu glanced
doubtfully at the Ford. "I hardly think, Swamiji, that any automobile
has ever penetrated into the interior as far as Biur. It might be
best if you all resign yourselves to the ancient jolt of the bullock
cart!"

As one <span class="t23 hoverable">voice</span> our party pledged loyalty to the Pride of Detroit.

"The Ford comes from America," I told the lawyer. "It <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be a
shame to deprive it of an opportunity to get acquainted with the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> of Bengal!"

"May Ganesh {FN46-4} go with you!" Lambadar Babu said, laughing.
He added courteously, "If you ever get there, I am sure Giri Bala
will be glad to see you. She is approaching her seventies, but
continues in excellent health."

"Please tell me, sir, if it is absolutely <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> that she eats
nothing?" I looked directly into his eyes, those telltale windows
of the mind.

[Illustration: GIRI BALA, This <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> woman yogi has not <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span>

or drink since 1880. I am pictured with her, in 1936, at her home
in the isolated Bengal village of Biur. Her non-eating <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> has
been rigorously investigated by the Maharaja of Burdwan. She employs
a certain yoga technique to recharge her <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> with cosmic energy
from the ether, sun, and air.--see giribala.jpg]

"It is true." His gaze was open and honorable. "In more than five
decades I have never seen her <span class="t28 hoverable">eat</span> a morsel. If the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> suddenly
came to an end, I could not be more astonished than by the sight
of my sister's taking food!"

We chuckled <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> over the improbability of these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> cosmic
events.

"Giri Bala has never sought an inaccessible solitude for her yoga
practices," Lambadar Babu <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> on. "She has lived her entire <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span>
surrounded by her family and friends. They are all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> accustomed
now to her strange state. Not one of them who <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> not be stupefied
if Giri Bala suddenly decided to <span class="t28 hoverable">eat</span> anything! Sister is naturally
retiring, as befits a Hindu widow, but our little circle in Purulia
and in Biur all know that she is literally an 'exceptional' woman."

The brother's sincerity was manifest. Our little party thanked him
warmly and <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> out toward Biur. We stopped at a street shop for
curry and LUCHIS, attracting a swarm of urchins who gathered round

to watch Mr. Wright eating with his fingers in the simple Hindu
manner. {FN46-5} Hearty appetites caused us to fortify ourselves
against an afternoon which, unknown at the moment, was to prove
fairly laborious.

Our <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> now led east through sun-baked rice fields into the Burdwan
section of Bengal. On through roads lined with dense vegetation;
the songs of the MAYNAS and the stripe-throated BULBULS streamed
out from trees with huge, umbrellalike branches. A bullock cart
now and then, the RINI, RINI, MANJU, MANJU squeak of its axle and
iron-shod wooden wheels contrasting sharply in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> with the SWISH,
SWISH of auto tires over the aristocratic asphalt of the cities.

"Dick, halt!" My sudden request <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> a jolting protest from the
Ford. "That overburdened mango tree is fairly shouting an invitation!"

The five of us dashed like <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">children</span> to the mango-strewn earth; the
tree had benevolently shed its fruits as they had ripened.

"Full many a mango is <span class="t16 t24 hoverable">born</span> to lie unseen," I paraphrased, "and
waste its sweetness on the stony ground."

"Nothing like this in America, Swamiji, eh?" laughed Sailesh
Mazumdar, one of my Bengali students.

"No," I admitted, covered with mango juice and contentment. "How
I have missed this fruit in the West! A Hindu's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heaven</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span>
mangoes is inconceivable!"

I picked up a rock and downed a proud beauty hidden on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span>
limb.

"Dick," I asked between bites of ambrosia, warm with the tropical
sun, "are all the cameras in the car?"

"Yes, sir; in the baggage compartment."

"If Giri Bala proves to be a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> saint, I want to write about her
in the West. A Hindu YOGINI with such inspiring powers should not
live and die unknown-like most of these mangoes."

Half an hour later I was still strolling in the sylvan peace.

"Sir," Mr. Wright remarked, "we should reach Giri Bala before the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> sets, to have enough <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> for photographs." He added with a
grin, "The Westerners are a skeptical lot; we can't expect them to
believe in the lady <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> any pictures!"

This bit of <span class="t12 t20 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">wisdom</span> was indisputable; I turned my back on temptation
and reentered the car.

"You are right, Dick," I sighed as we sped along, "I <span class="t2 t9 t10 t16 t18 t19 t27 t28 hoverable">sacrifice</span> the
mango paradise on the altar of Western realism. Photographs we must
have!"

The road became more and more sickly: wrinkles of ruts, boils of
hardened clay, the sad infirmities of old age! Our group dismounted
occasionally to allow Mr. Wright to more easily maneuver the Ford,
which the four of us pushed from behind.

"Lambadar Babu spoke truly," Sailesh acknowledged. "The car is not
carrying us; we are carrying the car!"

Our climb-in, climb-out auto tedium was beguiled ever and anon by
the appearance of a village, each one a scene of quaint simplicity.

"Our <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> twisted and turned through groves of palms among ancient,
unspoiled villages nestling in the forest shade," Mr. Wright has
recorded in his travel diary, under date of May 5, 1936. "Very
fascinating are these clusters of thatched mud huts, decorated with
one of the names of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> on the door; many small, naked <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">children</span>
innocently playing about, pausing to stare or run wildly from
this big, black, bullockless carriage tearing madly through their
village. The women merely peep from the shadows, while the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span>
lazily loll beneath the trees along the roadside, curious beneath

their nonchalance. In one place, all the villagers were gaily
bathing in the large tank (in their garments, changing by draping
dry cloths around their bodies, dropping the wet ones). Women
bearing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> to their homes, in huge brass jars.

"The road led us a merry chase over mount and ridge; we bounced and
tossed, dipped into small streams, detoured around an unfinished
causeway, slithered across dry, sandy river beds and finally, about
5:00 P.M., we were close to our destination, Biur. This minute
village in the interior of Bankura District, hidden in the protection
of dense foliage, is unapproachable by travelers during the rainy
season, when the streams are raging torrents and the roads serpentlike
spit the mud-venom.

"Asking for a guide among a group of worshipers on their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> home
from a temple prayer (out in the lonely field), we were besieged by
a dozen scantily clad lads who clambered on the sides of the car,
eager to conduct us to Giri Bala.

"The road led toward a grove of date palms sheltering a group of
mud huts, but before we had reached it, the Ford was momentarily
tipped at a dangerous angle, tossed up and dropped down. The narrow
trail led around trees and tank, over ridges, into holes and deep
ruts. The car became anchored on a clump of bushes, then grounded
on a hillock, requiring a lift of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> clods; on we proceeded,

slowly and carefully; suddenly the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> was stopped by a mass of
brush in the middle of the cart track, necessitating a detour down
a precipitous ledge into a dry tank, rescue from which demanded some
scraping, adzing, and shoveling. Again and again the road seemed
impassable, but the pilgrimage must go on; obliging lads fetched
spades and demolished the obstacles (shades of Ganesh!) while
hundreds of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">children</span> and parents stared.

"Soon we were threading our <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> along the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> ruts of antiquity,
women gazing wide-eyed from their hut doors, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> trailing alongside
and behind us, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">children</span> scampering to swell the procession. Ours
was perhaps the first auto to traverse these roads; the 'bullock
cart union' must be omnipotent here! What a sensation we created-a
group piloted by an American and pioneering in a snorting car
right into their hamlet fastness, invading the ancient privacy and
sanctity!

"Halting by a narrow lane we found ourselves <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> a hundred feet
of Giri Bala's ancestral home. We felt the thrill of fulfillment
after the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> road struggle crowned by a rough finish. We approached
a large, two-storied building of brick and plaster, dominating the
surrounding adobe huts; the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> was under the process of repair,
for around it was the characteristically tropical framework of
bamboos.

"With feverish anticipation and suppressed rejoicing we stood
before the open doors of the one <span class="t11 hoverable">blessed</span> by the Lord's 'hungerless'
touch. Constantly agape were the villagers, young and old, bare
and dressed, women aloof somewhat but inquisitive too, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> and
boys unabashedly at our heels as they gazed on this unprecedented
spectacle.

"Soon a short figure came into <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> in the doorway-Giri Bala! She
was swathed in a cloth of dull, goldish silk; in typically Indian
fashion, she drew forward modestly and hesitatingly, peering
slightly from beneath the upper fold of her SWADESHI cloth. Her
<span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> glistened like smouldering embers in the shadow of her <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span>
piece; we were enamored by a most benevolent and kindly face, a face
of realization and understanding, <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> from the taint of earthly
attachment.

"Meekly she approached and silently assented to our snapping a
<span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> of pictures with our 'still' and 'movie' cameras. {FN46-6}
Patiently and shyly she endured our photo techniques of posture
adjustment and <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> arrangement. Finally we had recorded for
posterity many photographs of the only woman in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> who is
known to have lived <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> or drink for over fifty years.
(Therese Neumann, of course, has fasted since 1923.) Most motherly
was Giri Bala's expression as she stood before us, completely
covered in the loose-flowing cloth, nothing of her <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> visible

but her face with its downcast eyes, her hands, and her tiny feet.
A face of rare <span class="t13 hoverable">peace</span> and innocent poise-a wide, childlike, quivering
lip, a feminine nose, narrow, sparkling eyes, and a wistful smile."

Mr. Wright's impression of Giri Bala was shared by myself; spirituality
enfolded her like her gently shining veil. She PRONAMED before me
in the customary gesture of greeting from a householder to a monk.
Her simple charm and quiet smile gave us a welcome beyond that of
honeyed oratory; forgotten was our difficult, dusty trip.

The little saint seated herself cross-legged on the verandah. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Though</span>
bearing the scars of age, she was not emaciated; her olive-colored
skin had remained clear and healthy in tone.

"Mother," I said in Bengali, "for over twenty-five <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> I have
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> eagerly of this very pilgrimage! I <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> about your sacred
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> from Sthiti Lal Nundy Babu."

She nodded in acknowledgment. "Yes, my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> neighbor in Nawabganj."

"During those <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> I have crossed the oceans, but I never forgot
my early plan to someday see you. The sublime drama that you are
here playing so inconspicuously should be blazoned before a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span>
that has <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> forgotten the inner <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> divine."

The saint lifted her <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> for a minute, smiling with serene interest.

"Baba (honored father) knows best," she answered meekly.

I was happy that she had <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> no offense; one never knows how
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> yogis or yoginis will react to the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> of publicity. They
shun it, as a rule, wishing to pursue in silence the profound <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span>
research. An inner sanction comes to them when the proper <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span>
arrives to display their lives openly for the benefit of seeking
minds.

"Mother," I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> on, "please forgive me, then, for burdening you
with many questions. Kindly answer only those that please you; I
shall understand your silence, also."

She spread her <span class="t13 t23 hoverable">hands</span> in a gracious gesture. "I am glad to reply,
insofar as an insignificant <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> like myself can give satisfactory
answers."

"Oh, no, not insignificant!" I protested sincerely. "You are a
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> soul."

"I am the humble servant of all." She added quaintly, "I <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t8 t13 t15 t17 t18 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> to
cook and feed people."

A strange pastime, I thought, for a non-eating saint!

"Tell me, Mother, from your own lips-do you live <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> food?"

"That is true." She was silent for a few moments; her next remark
showed that she had been struggling with mental arithmetic. "From
the age of twelve <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> four months down to my present age of
sixty-eight--a period of over fifty-six years--I have not eaten
<span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> or <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> liquids."

"Are you never tempted to eat?"

"If I felt a craving for food, I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have to eat." Simply <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span>
regally she stated this axiomatic truth, one known too <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> by a
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> revolving around <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> meals a day!

"But you do <span class="t28 hoverable">eat</span> something!" My tone held a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">note</span> of remonstrance.

"Of course!" She smiled in swift understanding.

"Your nourishment derives from the finer energies of the air and
sunlight, {FN46-7} and from the cosmic <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> which recharges your

"Baba knows." Again she acquiesced, her manner soothing and

unemphatic.

"Mother, please tell me about your early life. It holds a deep
interest for all of India, and even for our brothers and sisters
beyond the seas."

Giri Bala put aside her habitual reserve, relaxing into a conversational
mood.

"So be it." Her <span class="t23 hoverable">voice</span> was low and firm. "I was <span class="t16 t24 hoverable">born</span> in these forest
regions. My childhood was unremarkable save that I was possessed
by an insatiable appetite. I had been betrothed in early years.

"'Child,' my mother often warned me, 'try to control your greed.
When the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> comes for you to live among strangers in your husband's
family, what will they think of you if your <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">days</span> are spent in
nothing but eating?'

"The calamity she had foreseen came to pass. I was only twelve
when I joined my husband's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> in Nawabganj. My mother-in-law
shamed me morning, noon, and night about my gluttonous habits.
Her scoldings were a blessing in disguise, however; they roused my
dormant <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> tendencies. One morning her ridicule was merciless.

"'I shall soon prove to you,' I said, stung to the quick, 'that I

shall never touch <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> again as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> as I live.'

"My mother-in-law laughed in derision. 'So!' she said, 'how can
you live <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> eating, when you cannot live <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> overeating?'

"This remark was unanswerable! <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> an iron resolution scaffolded
my spirit. In a secluded spot I sought my Heavenly Father.

"'Lord,' I prayed incessantly, 'please send me a guru, one who can
teach me to live by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thy</span> <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> and not by food.'

"A <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> ecstasy fell over me. Led by a beatific spell, I <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> out
for the Nawabganj GHAT on the Ganges. On the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> I encountered the
priest of my husband's family.

"'Venerable sir,' I said trustingly, 'kindly tell me how to live
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> eating.'

"He stared at me <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> reply. Finally he spoke in a consoling
manner. 'Child,' he said, 'come to the temple this evening; I will
conduct a special VEDIC ceremony for you.'

"This vague answer was not the one I was seeking; I continued toward
the GHAT. The morning <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> pierced the waters; I purified myself in
the Ganges, as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> for a sacred initiation. As I <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> the river

bank, my wet cloth around me, in the broad glare of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> my <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span>
materialized himself before me!

"'Dear little one,' he said in a <span class="t23 hoverable">voice</span> of loving compassion, 'I
am the guru sent here by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> to fulfill your urgent prayer. He was
deeply touched by its very unusual nature! From today you shall
live by the astral light, your bodily atoms fed from the infinite
current.'"

Giri Bala fell into silence. I <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> Mr. Wright's pencil and pad
and translated into English a few items for his information.

The saint resumed the tale, her gentle <span class="t23 hoverable">voice</span> barely audible. "The
GHAT was deserted, but my guru cast round us an aura of guarding
light, that no stray bathers later disturb us. He initiated me
into a KRIA technique which frees the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> from dependence on the
gross <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> of mortals. The technique includes the <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> of a certain
MANTRA {FN46-8} and a breathing exercise more difficult than the
average <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> could perform. No medicine or magic is involved;
nothing beyond the KRIA."

In the manner of the American newspaper reporter, who had unknowingly
taught me his procedure, I questioned Giri Bala on many matters
which I <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be of interest to the world. She gave me,
bit by bit, the following information:

"I have never had any children; many <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> ago I became a widow.
I sleep very little, as sleep and waking are the same to me. I
meditate at night, attending to my domestic duties in the daytime. I
slightly feel the change in climate from season to season. I have
never been sick or experienced any disease. I feel only slight
pain when accidentally injured. I have no bodily excretions. I
can control my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> and breathing. I often see my guru as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as
other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> souls, in vision."

"Mother," I asked, "why don't you teach others the method of living
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> food?"

My ambitious hopes for the world's starving millions were nipped
in the bud.

"No." She shook her head. "I was strictly commanded by my guru
not to divulge the secret. It is not his wish to tamper with God's
drama of creation. The farmers <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> not thank me if I taught
many <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> to live <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> eating! The luscious fruits <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> lie
uselessly on the ground. It appears that misery, starvation, and
disease are whips of our karma which ultimately drive us to seek
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> of life."

"Mother," I said slowly, "what is the <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> of your having been

singled out to live <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> eating?"

"To prove that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> is Spirit." Her face lit with wisdom. "To
demonstrate that by <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> advancement he can gradually learn to
live by the <span class="t20 hoverable">Eternal</span> <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Light</span> and not by food."

The saint sank into a deep meditative state. Her gaze was directed
inward; the gentle depths of her <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> became expressionless. She
gave a certain sigh, the prelude to the ecstatic breathless trance.
For a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> she had fled to the questionless realm, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heaven</span> of
inner joy.

The tropical darkness had fallen. The <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> of a small kerosene
lamp flickered fitfully over the faces of a score of villagers
squatting silently in the shadows. The darting glowworms and distant
oil lanterns of the huts wove bright eerie patterns into the velvet
night. It was the painful hour of parting; a slow, tedious journey
lay before our little party.

"Giri Bala," I said as the saint opened her eyes, "please give me
a keepsake-a strip of one of your SARIS."

She soon returned with a piece of Benares silk, extending it in
her <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> as she suddenly prostrated herself on the ground.

"Mother," I said reverently, "rather let me touch your own <span class="t11 hoverable">blessed</span>
feet!"

{FN46-7} "What we <span class="t28 hoverable">eat</span> is radiation; our <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> is so much quanta

medical <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> on May 17, 1933 in Memphis. "This all-important radiation,
which releases electrical currents for the body's electrical circuit,

the nervous system, is given to <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> by the sun's rays. Atoms, Dr.
Crile says, are solar systems. Atoms are the vehicles that are
filled with solar radiance as so many coiled springs. These countless
atomfuls of energy are <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> in as food. Once in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> body,
these tense vehicles, the atoms, are discharged in the body's
protoplasm, the radiance furnishing new chemical energy, new

Crile said. 'They are your muscles, brains, and sensory organs,

Someday scientists will discover how <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> can live directly on solar

{FN46-8} Potent vibratory chant. The literal translation of Sanskrit
MANTRA is "instrument of thought," signifying the ideal, inaudible
sounds which represent one aspect of creation; when vocalized as

powers of sound derive from AUM, the "Word" or creative hum of the
Cosmic Motor.

CHAPTER: 47

I RETURN TO THE WEST

"I have given many yoga lessons in India and America; but I must
confess that, as a Hindu, I am unusually happy to be conducting a
class for English students."

My London class members laughed appreciatively; no political turmoils
ever disturbed our yoga peace.

India was now a hallowed memory. It is September, 1936; I am
in England to fulfill a promise, given sixteen months earlier, to
lecture again in London.

England, too, is receptive to the timeless yoga message. Reporters
and newsreel cameramen swarmed over my quarters at Grosvenor House.
The British National Council of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">World</span> Fellowship of Faiths
organized a meeting on September 29th at Whitefield's Congregational
Church where I addressed the audience on the weighty subject of

"How <span class="t4 t7 t12 t16 hoverable">Faith</span> in Fellowship may Save Civilization." The eight o'clock
lectures at Caxton Hall attracted such crowds that on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> nights
the overflow waited in Windsor <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">House</span> auditorium for my <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> talk
at nine-thirty. Yoga classes during the following weeks grew so
large that Mr. Wright was obliged to arrange a transfer to another
hall.

The English tenacity has admirable expression in a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span>
relationship. The London yoga students loyally organized themselves,
after my departure, into a Self-Realization Fellowship center,
holding their <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> meetings weekly throughout the bitter war
years.

Unforgettable weeks in England; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">days</span> of sight-seeing in London,
then over the beautiful countryside. Mr. Wright and I summoned the
trusty Ford to visit the birthplaces and tombs of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> poets
and heroes of British history.

Our little party sailed from Southampton for America in late October
on the BREMEN. The majestic Statue of Liberty in New York harbor
<span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> a joyous emotional gulp not only to the throats of Miss
Bletch and Mr. Wright, but to my own.

The Ford, a bit battered from struggles with ancient soils, was
still puissant; it now <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> in its stride the transcontinental trip

to California. In late 1936, lo! Mount Washington.

The year-end holidays are celebrated annually at the Los Angeles
center with an eight-hour group <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on December 24th
(Spiritual Christmas), followed the next <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> by a banquet (Social
Christmas). The festivities this year were augmented by the presence
of dear friends and students from distant cities who had arrived
to welcome home the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> travelers.

The Christmas <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Day</span> feast included delicacies <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> fifteen <span class="t15 t23 hoverable">thousand</span>
miles for this glad occasion: GUCCHI mushrooms from Kashmir, canned
RASAGULLA and mango pulp, PAPAR biscuits, and an oil of the Indian

grouped around a huge sparkling Christmas tree, the near-by fireplace
crackling with logs of aromatic cypress.

Gift-time! Presents from the earth's far corners-Palestine, Egypt,
India, England, France, Italy. How laboriously had Mr. Wright
counted the trunks at each foreign junction, that no pilfering <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span>

of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> continents!

One by one I distributed the gaily wrapped packages from the immense
pile under the tree.

"Sister Gyanamata!" I handed a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> box to the saintly American
lady of sweet visage and deep realization who, during my absence,
had been in charge at Mt. Washington. From the paper tissues she
lifted a SARI of golden Benares silk.

"Thank you, sir; it brings the pageant of India before my eyes."

"Mr. Dickinson!" The next parcel contained a gift which I had
bought in a Calcutta bazaar. "Mr. Dickinson will like this," I had
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> at the time. A dearly beloved disciple, Mr. Dickinson had
been present at every Christmas festivity since the 1925 founding
of Mt. Washington. At this eleventh annual celebration, he was
standing before me, untying the ribbons of his square little package.

"The silver cup!" Struggling with emotion, he stared at the present,
a tall drinking cup. He seated himself some distance away, apparently

in a daze. I smiled at him affectionately before resuming my role
as Santa Claus.

The ejaculatory evening closed with a prayer to the Giver of all
gifts; then a group singing of Christmas carols.

Mr. Dickinson and I were chatting <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> sometime later.

"Sir," he said, "please let me thank you now for the silver cup.
I could not <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> on Christmas night."

"I <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> the gift especially for you."

"For forty-three <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> I have been waiting for that silver cup! It
is a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> story, one I have kept hidden <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> me." Mr. Dickinson
looked at me shyly. "The beginning was dramatic: I was drowning.
My older brother had playfully pushed me into a fifteen-foot pool
in a small town in Nebraska. I was only five <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> old then. As I

multicolored <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> appeared, filling all space. In the midst was
the figure of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> with tranquil <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> and a reassuring smile.
My <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> was sinking for the <span class="t7 hoverable">third</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> when one of my brother's
companions bent a tall slender willow tree in such a low dip that
I could grasp it with my desperate fingers. The boys lifted me to
the bank and successfully gave me first-aid treatment.

was in session. Mother and I were walking down a main street, when
again I saw the mighty flash of light. A few paces away, strolling
leisurely along, was the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> I had seen <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> before in vision.
He approached a large auditorium and vanished <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the door.

"'Mother,' I cried, 'that was the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> who appeared at the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> I

"She and I hastened into the building; the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> was seated on a
lecture platform. We soon learned that he was Swami Vivekananda of

India. {FN47-1} After he had given a soul-stirring talk, I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span>
forward to meet him. He smiled on me graciously, as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> we
were old friends. I was so young that I did not know how to give
expression to my feelings, but in my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> I was hoping that he

"'No, my son, I am not your guru.' Vivekananda gazed with his
beautiful, piercing <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> deep into my own. 'Your teacher will come
later. He will give you a silver cup.' After a little pause, he
added, smiling, 'He will pour out to you more blessings than you
are now able to hold.'

"I <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> Chicago in a few days," Mr. Dickinson <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> on, "and never

by soft strains of melody. A band of celestial beings, carrying
flutes and other instruments, came before my view. After filling
the air with glorious music, the angels slowly vanished.

"The next evening I attended, for the first time, one of your lectures
here in Los Angeles, and knew then that my prayer had been granted."

We smiled at each other in silence.

"For eleven <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> now I have been your KRIYA YOGA disciple," Mr.
Dickinson continued. "Sometimes I wondered about the silver cup;

CHAPTER: 48

AT ENCINITAS IN CALIFORNIA

"A surprise, sir! During your absence abroad we have had this
Encinitas hermitage built; it is a 'welcome-home' gift!" Sister
Gyanamata smilingly led me through a gate and up a tree-shaded
walk.

I saw a building jutting out like a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> white ocean liner toward
the blue brine. First speechlessly, then with "Oh's!" and "Ah's!",

finally with man's insufficient vocabulary of joy and gratitude,
I examined the ashram-sixteen unusually large rooms, each one
charmingly appointed.

The stately central hall, with immense ceiling-high windows, looks
out on a united altar of grass, ocean, sky-a symphony in emerald,
opal, sapphire. A mantle over the hall's huge fireplace holds the
framed likeness of Lahiri Mahasaya, smiling his blessing over this
far Pacific heaven.

Directly below the hall, built into the very bluff, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> solitary
<span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> caves confront the infinities of sky and sea. Verandahs,
sun-bathing nooks, acres of orchard, a eucalypti grove, flagstone
paths leading through roses and lilies to quiet arbors, a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span>
flight of stairs ending on an isolated beach and the vast waters!
Was dream ever more concrete?

"May the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> and heroic and bountiful souls of the saints come
here," reads "A Prayer for a Dwelling," from the ZEND-AVESTA,
fastened on one of the hermitage doors, "and may they go <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> in

widespread as the earth, as far-flung as the rivers, as high-reaching
as the sun, for the furtherance of better men, for the increase of
abundance and glory.

"May obedience conquer disobedience <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> this house; may <span class="t13 hoverable">peace</span>
triumph here over discord; free-hearted giving over avarice, truthful
speech over deceit, reverence over contempt. That our minds be
delighted, and our souls uplifted, let our bodies be glorified as
well; and O <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Light</span> Divine, may we see Thee, and may we, approaching,
come round about Thee, and attain <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">unto</span> <span class="t6 t13 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">Thine</span> entire companionship!"

[Illustration: Encinitas, California, overlooking the Pacific.
Main building and part of the grounds of the Self-Realization
Fellowship--see encinitas.jpg]

This Self-Realization Fellowship ashram had been made possible through
the generosity of a few American disciples, American businessmen
of endless responsibilities who <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> daily for their KRIYA
YOGA. Not a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> of the hermitage construction had been allowed to
reach me during my stay in India and Europe. Astonishment, delight!

During my earlier <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> in America I had combed the coast of
California in quest of a small site for a seaside ashram; whenever I
had found a suitable location, some obstacle had invariably arisen
to thwart me. Gazing now over the broad acres of Encinitas, {FN48-1}
humbly I saw the effortless fulfillment of Sri Yukteswar's long-ago
prophecy: "a hermitage by the ocean."

A few months later, Easter of 1937, I conducted on the smooth lawns

at Encinitas the first of many Sunrise Services. Like the magi of
old, several hundred students gazed in devotional awe at the daily
miracle, the early solar <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> rite in the eastern sky. To the west
lay the inexhaustible Pacific, booming its solemn praise; in the
distance, a tiny white sailing boat, and the lonely flight of a
seagull. "Christ, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thou</span> <span class="t2 t6 t8 t9 t10 t15 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">art</span> risen!" Not alone with the vernal sun,
but in the <span class="t20 hoverable">eternal</span> dawn of Spirit!

Many happy months sped by; in the <span class="t13 hoverable">peace</span> of perfect beauty I was
able to complete at the hermitage a long-projected work, COSMIC
CHANTS. I <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> to English <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> and Western musical notation about

of Silence," and "Thou <span class="t2 t6 t8 t9 t10 t15 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">Art</span> my Life."

For a preface to the songbook I recounted my first outstanding
experience with the receptivity of Westerners to the quaintly
devotional airs of the East. The occasion had been a public lecture;
the time, April 18, 1926; the place, Carnegie Hall in New York.

"Mr. Hunsicker," I had confided to an American student, "I am planning
to ask the audience to sing an ancient Hindu chant, 'O <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> Beautiful!'"

"Sir," Mr. Hunsicker had protested, "these Oriental songs are alien
to American understanding. What a shame if the lecture were to be
marred by a commentary of overripe tomatoes!"

I had laughingly disagreed. "Music is a universal language.
Americans will not fail to feel the soul-aspiration in this lofty
chant." {FN48-2}

During the lecture Mr. Hunsicker had sat behind me on the platform,
probably fearing for my safety. His doubts were groundless; not
only had there been an absence of unwelcome vegetables, but for
one hour and twenty-five minutes the strains of "O <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> Beautiful!"
had sounded uninterruptedly from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> <span class="t15 t23 hoverable">thousand</span> throats. Blase' no
longer, dear New Yorkers; your hearts had soared out in a simple
paean of rejoicing! <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> healings had <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> that evening
among the devotees chanting with <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t8 t13 t15 t17 t18 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> the Lord's <span class="t11 hoverable">blessed</span> name.

The secluded <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of a literary minstrel was not my role for long.
Soon I was dividing every fortnight between Los Angeles and Encinitas.
Sunday services, classes, lectures before clubs and colleges,
interviews with students, ceaseless streams of correspondence, articles

for EAST-WEST, direction of activities in India and numerous small
centers in American cities. Much <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> was given, also, to the
arrangement of KRIYA and other Self-Realization Fellowship teachings
into a series of studies for the distant yoga seekers <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> zeal
recognized no limitation of space.

Joyous dedication of a Self-Realization Church of All Religions <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span>
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> in 1938 at Washington, D.C. <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Set</span> amidst landscaped grounds,
the stately church stands in a section of the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">city</span> aptly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span>
"Friendship Heights." The Washington leader is Swami Premananda,
educated at the Ranchi school and Calcutta University. I had summoned
him in 1928 to assume leadership of the Washington Self-Realization
Fellowship center.

"Premananda," I told him during a visit to his new temple, "this
Eastern headquarters is a memorial in stone to your tireless
devotion. Here in the nation's capital you have held aloft the
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> of Lahiri Mahasaya's ideals."

Premananda accompanied me from Washington for a brief visit to
the Self-Realization Fellowship center in Boston. What joy to see
again the KRIYA YOGA band who had remained steadfast since 1920!
The Boston leader, Dr. M. W. Lewis, lodged my companion and myself
in a modern, artistically decorated suite.

"Sir," Dr. Lewis said to me, smiling, "during your early <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> in
America you stayed in this <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">city</span> in a single room, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> bath. I
wanted you to know that Boston possesses some luxurious apartments!"

The shadows of approaching carnage were lengthening over the world;
already the acute ear might hear the frightful drums of war. During
interviews with thousands in California, and through a world-wide
correspondence, I found that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> and women were deeply searching
their hearts; the tragic outer insecurity had emphasized need for
the <span class="t20 hoverable">Eternal</span> Anchorage.

"We have indeed learned the value of meditation," the leader of the
London Self-Realization Fellowship center wrote me in 1941, "and
know that nothing can disturb our inner peace. In the last few weeks
during the meetings we have <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> air-raid warnings and listened
to the explosion of delayed-action bombs, but our students still
gather and thoroughly enjoy our beautiful service."

Another letter reached me from war-torn England just before America
entered the conflict. In nobly pathetic words, Dr. L. Cranmer Byng,
noted editor of THE <span class="t12 t20 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">WISDOM</span> OF THE EAST SERIES, wrote:

"When I read EAST-WEST I realized how far apart we seemed to be,
apparently living in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> different worlds. Beauty, order, calm,
and <span class="t13 hoverable">peace</span> come to me from Los Angeles, sailing into port as a

vessel laden with the blessings and comfort of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Holy</span> Grail to
a beleaguered city.

"I see as in a dream your palm tree grove, and the temple at
Encinitas with its ocean stretches and mountain views, and above
all its fellowship of spiritually minded <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> and women, a community
comprehended in unity, absorbed in creative work, and replenished
in contemplation. It is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> of my own vision, in
the making of which I hoped to bear my little part, and now . . .

"Perhaps in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> I shall never reach your golden shores nor
worship in your temple. But it is something and more, to have had
the vision and know that in the midst of war there is still a <span class="t13 hoverable">peace</span>
that abides in your harbors and among your hills. Greetings to all
the Fellowship from a common soldier, <span class="t0 t11 t24 hoverable">written</span> on the watchtower
waiting for the dawn."

The war <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> awakening among <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> diversions
had never before included a study of the New Testament. One sweet
distillment from the bitter herbs of war! To satisfy a growing
need, an inspiring little Self-Realization Church of All Religions
was built and dedicated in 1942 at Hollywood. The site faces Olive
Hill and the distant Los Angeles Planetarium. The church, finished
in blue, white, and gold, is reflected amidst the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> hyacinths
in a large pool. The gardens are gay with flowers, a few startled

stone deer, a stained-glass pergola, and a quaint wishing well.
Thrown in with the pennies and the kaleidoscopic wishes of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span>
has been many a pure aspiration for the sole treasure of Spirit! A
universal benignity flows from small niches with statues of Lahiri
Mahasaya and Sri Yukteswar, and of Krishna, Buddha, Confucius, St.
Francis, and a beautiful mother-of-pearl reproduction of <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Christ</span> at
the Last Supper.

Another Self-Realization Church of All Religions was founded in
1943 at San Diego. A quiet hilltop temple, it stands in a sloping
valley of eucalypti, overlooking sparkling San Diego Bay.

Sitting one evening in this tranquil haven, I was pouring out my
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> in song. Under my fingers was the sweet-toned organ of the
church, on my lips the yearning plaint of an ancient Bengali devotee
who had searched for <span class="t20 hoverable">eternal</span> solace:

In this world, Mother, none can <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t8 t13 t15 t17 t18 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> me;
In this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> they do not know <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t8 t13 t15 t17 t18 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> divine.
Where is there pure loving love?
Where is there truly loving Thee?
There my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> longs to be.

My companion in the chapel, Dr. Lloyd Kennell, the San Diego center
leader, was smiling a little at the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> of the song.

"Tell me truly, Paramhansaji, has it been worth it?" He gazed at
me with an earnest sincerity. I understood his laconic question:
"Have you been happy in America? What about the disillusionments,
the heartaches, the center leaders who could not lead, the students
who could not be taught?"

"Blessed is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> whom the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> doth test, Doctor! He has remembered
now and then to put a burden on me!" I thought, then, of all the
faithful ones, of the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t8 t13 t15 t17 t18 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> and devotion and understanding that
lay in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> of America. With slow emphasis I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> on, "But my
answer is: Yes, a <span class="t15 t23 hoverable">thousand</span> times yes! It has been worth-while; it
has been a constant inspiration, more than ever I dreamed, to see
West and East <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> closer in the only lasting bond, the spiritual!"

Silently I added a prayer: "May Babaji and Sri Yukteswarji feel
that I have done my part, not disappointing the <span class="t23 hoverable">high</span> hope in which
they sent me forth."

I turned again to the organ; this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> my song was tinged with a
martial valor:

The grinding wheel of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Time</span> doth mar
<span class="t5 hoverable">Full</span> many a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of moon and star
And many a brightly smiling morn--

But still my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> is marching on!

Darkness, death, and failures vied;
To block my path they fiercely tried;
My fight with jealous Nature's strong-But still my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> is marching on!

New Year's week of 1945 found me at <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> in my Encinitas study,
revising the manuscript of this book.

"Paramhansaji, please come outdoors." Dr. Lewis, on a visit from
Boston, smiled at me pleadingly from outside my window. Soon we
were strolling in the sunshine. My companion pointed to new towers
in process of construction along the edge of the Fellowship property
adjoining the coast highway.

"Sir, I see many improvements here since my last visit." Dr. Lewis
comes twice annually from Boston to Encinitas.

"Yes, Doctor, a project I have <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> considered is beginning to

a miniature <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> colony. Brotherhood is an ideal better understood
by example than precept! A small harmonious group here may inspire
other ideal communities over the earth."

"A splendid idea, sir! The colony will surely be a success if
everyone sincerely does his part!"

"'World' is a large term, but <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> must enlarge his allegiance,
considering himself in the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> citizen," I continued.
"A <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> who truly feels: 'The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> is my homeland; it is my
America, my India, my Philippines, my England, my Africa,' will
never lack scope for a useful and happy life. His natural local pride
will know limitless expansion; he will be in touch with creative
universal currents."

Dr. Lewis and I halted above the lotus pool near the hermitage.
Below us lay the illimitable Pacific.

"These same waters break equally on the coasts of West and East,
in California and China." My companion threw a little stone into
the first of the oceanic seventy million square miles. "Encinitas
is a symbolic spot for a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> colony."

"That is true, Doctor. We shall arrange here for many conferences
and Congresses of Religion, inviting delegates from all lands. Flags
of the nations will hang in our halls. Diminutive temples will be
built over the grounds, dedicated to the world's principal religions.

"As soon as possible," I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> on, "I plan to open a Yoga Institute

August 15, 1945, close of Global War II! End of a world; dawn of
an enigmatic Atomic Age! The hermitage residents gathered in the

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often <span class="t16 hoverable">created</span> from several printed

to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc. Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers. If the value
per <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span>

If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten <span class="t15 t23 hoverable">thousand</span> titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> of computer users.

We have filed in all 50 states now, but these are the only ones
that have responded.

As the requirements for other states are met, additions to this list
will be made and fund raising will begin in the additional states.
Please feel <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> to ask to check the status of your state.

In answer to various questions we have received on this:

We are constantly working on finishing the paperwork to legally
request donations in all 50 states. If your <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> is not listed and

donations from donors in these states who approach us with an offer to
donate.

International donations are accepted, but we don't know ANYTHING about
how to make them tax-deductible, or even if they CAN be made
deductible, and don't have the staff to handle it even if there are
ways.
