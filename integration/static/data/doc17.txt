Preamble
THIS IS THE BEGINNING of the old traditions of this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Quiché.
Here we shall write and we shall begin the old stories, the beginning and the origin of all that
was done in the town of the Quiché, by the tribes of the Quiché nation.
And here we shall <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> forth the revelation, the declaration, and the narration of all that was
hidden, the revelation by Tzacol, Bitol, Alom, Qaholom, who are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Hunahpú-Vuch,
Hunahpú-Utiú, Zaqui-Nimá-Tziís, Tepeu, Gucumatz, u Qux cho, u Qux Paló, Ali Raxá Lac,
Ah Raxá Tzel, as they were called. And [at the same time] the declaration, the combined
narration of the Grandmother and the Grandfather, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> names are Xpiyacoc, and Xmucané,
helpers and protectors, twice grandmother, twice grandfather, so <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> in the Quiché
chronicles. Then we shall tell all that they did in the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> of existence, in the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> of history.
This we shall write now under the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Law</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> and Christianity; we shall <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> it to <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span>
because now the Popol Vuh, as it is called, cannot be seen any more, in which was dearly seen
the coming from the other <span class="t6 hoverable">side</span> of the sea and the narration of our obscurity, and our <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> was

searcher and to the thinker. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Great</span> were the descriptions and the <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of how all the sky and

how the sky was divided; and the measuring-cord was brought, and it was stretched in the sky
and over the earth, on the four angles, on the four corners, as was told by the Creator and the
Maker, the Mother and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Father</span> of Life, of all <span class="t16 hoverable">created</span> things, he who gives breath and

exists in the sky, on the earth, in the lakes and in the sea.

PART I: <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">Chapter</span> 1
THIS IS THE <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">ACCOUNT</span> OF HOW ALL WAS in suspense, all calm, in silence; all
motionless, still, and the expanse of the sky was empty.
This is the first account, the first narrative. There was neither man, nor animal, birds, fishes,
crabs, trees, stones, caves, ravines, grasses, nor forests; there was only the sky.
The surface of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> had not appeared. There was only the calm sea and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> expanse
of the sky.
There was nothing <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> together, nothing which could make a noise, nor anything which
might move, or tremble, or could make noise in the sky.
There was nothing standing; only the calm water, the placid sea, alone and tranquil. Nothing
existed.
There was only immobility and silence in the darkness, in the night. Only the creator, the
Maker, Tepeu, Gucumatz, the Forefathers, were in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> surrounded with light. They were
hidden under green and blue feathers, and were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Gucumatz. By <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> they
were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> sages and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> thinkers. In this manner the sky existed and also the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Heart</span> of
Heaven, which is the name of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> He is called.
Then came the word. Tepeu and Gucumatz came <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> in the darkness, in the night, and
Tepeu and Gucumatz talked together. They talked then, discussing and deliberating; they
agreed, they united their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> and their thoughts.
Then while they meditated, it became clear to them that when dawn <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> break, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> must
appear. Then they planned the creation, and the growth of the trees and the thickets and the
birth of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> and the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span> of man. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> it was arranged in the darkness and in the night by
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Heart</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Heaven</span> who is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Huracán.
The first is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Caculhá Huracán. The <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> is Chipi-Caculhá. The <span class="t7 hoverable">third</span> is Raxa-Caculhá.
And these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> are the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Heart</span> of Heaven.
Then Tepeu and Gucumatz came together; then they conferred about <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> and light, what they

sustenance.
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> let it be done! Let the emptiness be filled! Let the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> recede and make a void, let the

Let there be light, let there be
dawn in the sky and on the earth! There shall be neither <span class="t0 t7 t21 t27 hoverable">glory</span> nor grandeur in our <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span> and

So they spoke.
Then the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> was <span class="t16 hoverable">created</span> by them. So it was, in truth, that they <span class="t16 hoverable">created</span> the earth. Earth! they
said, and instantly it was made.
Like the mist, like a cloud, and like a cloud of dust was the creation, when the mountains
appeared from the water; and instantly the mountains grew.

Only by a miracle, only by magic <span class="t2 t6 t8 t9 t10 t15 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">art</span> were the mountains and valleys formed; and instantly
the groves of cypresses and pines put forth shoots <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> on the surface of the earth.
And <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> Gucumatz was filled with joy, and exclaimed: "Your coming has been fruitful, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Heart</span>
of Heaven; and you, Huracán, and you, Chipi-Caculhá, Raxa-Caculhá!"
"Our work, our <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span> shall be finished," they answered.
First the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> was formed, the mountains and the valleys; the currents of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> were divided,
the rivulets were running freely between the hills, and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> was separated when the <span class="t23 hoverable">high</span>
mountains appeared.
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> was the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> created, when it was formed by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Heart</span> of Heaven, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Heart</span> of Earth, as

submerged in the water.
So it was that they made perfect the work, when they did it after thinking and meditating <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span>

Then they made the small wild animals, the guardians of the woods, the spirits of the
mountains, the deer, the birds, pumas, jaguars, serpents, snakes. vipers, guardians of the
thickets.
And the Forefathers asked: 'Shall there be only silence and calm under the trees, under the
vines? It is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> that hereafter there be someone to guard them."
So they said when they meditated and talked. Promptly the deer and the birds were created.
immediately they gave homes to the deer and the birds. "You, deer, shall sleep in the fields by
the river bank and in the ravines. Here you shall be amongst the thicket, amongst the pasture;
in the woods you shall multiply, you shall walk on four feet and they will support you. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span>
be it done!" So it was they spoke.
Then they also assigned homes to the birds big and small. "You shall live in the trees and in
the vines. There you shall make your nests; there you shall multiply; there you shall increase
in the branches of the trees and in the vines." <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> the deer and the birds were told; they did
their duty at once, and all sought their homes and their nests.
And the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span> of all the four-footed animals and the birds being finished, they were told by
the Creator and the Maker and the Forefathers: "Speak, cry, warble, call, <span class="t9 t11 t20 t21 t22 t23 t27 hoverable">speak</span> each one
according to your variety, each, according to your kind." So was it said to the deer, the birds,
pumas, jaguars, and serpents.
"Speak, then, our names, praise us, your mother, your father. Invoke then, Huracán, ChipiCaculhá, Raxa-Caculhá, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Heart</span> of Heaven, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Heart</span> of Earth, the Creator, the Maker, the
Forefathers; speak, invoke us, adore us," they were told.

But they could not make them <span class="t9 t11 t20 t21 t22 t23 t27 hoverable">speak</span> like men; they only hissed and screamed and cackled;
they were unable to make words, and each screamed in a different way.
When the Creator and the Maker saw that it was impossible for them to talk to each other,
they said: "It is impossible for them to say our names, the names of us, their Creators and
Makers. This is not well," said the Forefathers to each other.
Then they said to them: "Because it has not been possible for you to talk, you shall be
changed. We have changed our minds: Your food, your pasture, your homes. and your nests
you shall have; they shall be the ravines and the woods, because it has not been possible for
you to adore us or invoke us. There shall be those who adore us, we shall make other [beings]
who shall be obedient. Accept your destiny: your <span class="t21 hoverable">flesh</span> shall be tom to pieces. So shall it be.
This shall be your lot." So they said, when they made known their will to the large and small
animals which are on the face of the earth.
They wished to give them another trial; they, wished to make another attempt; they wished to
make [all living things] adore them.
But they could not understand each other's speech; they could succeed in nothing, and could
do nothing. For this <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> they were sacrificed and the animals which were on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> were
condemned to be killed and eaten.
For this <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> another attempt had to be made to create and make <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> by the Creator, the
Maker, and the Forefathers.
"Let us try again! Already dawn draws near: Let us make him who shall nourish and sustain
us! What shall we do to be invoked, in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> to be remembered on earth? We have already
tried with our first creations, our first creatures; but we could not make them praise and
venerate us. So, then, let us try to make obedient, respectful <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> who will nourish and
sustain us." <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> they spoke.
Then was the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span> and the formation. Of earth, of mud, they made [man's] flesh. But they
saw that it was not good. It melted away, it was soft, did not move, had no strength, it fell
down, it was limp, it could not move its head, its face fell to one side, its sight was blurred, it
could not look behind. At first it spoke, but had no mind. Quickly it soaked in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> and
could not stand.
And the Creator and the Maker said: "Let us try again because our creatures will not be able
to walk nor multiply. Let us consider this," they said.
Then they broke up and destroyed their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> and their creation. And they said: "What shall
we do to perfect it, in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> that our worshipers, our invokers, will be successful?"
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> they spoke when they conferred again: "Let us say again to Xpiyacoc, Xmucané,
Hunahpú-Vuch, Hunahpú-Utiú: 'Cast your lot again. Try to create again.'" In this manner the
Creator and the Maker spoke to Xpiyacoc and Xmucané.
Then they spoke to those soothsayers, the Grandmother of the day, the Grandmother of the
Dawn, as they were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> by the Creator and the Maker, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> names were Xpiyacoc
and Xmucané.

And said Huracán, Tepeu, and Gucumatz when they spoke to the soothsayer, to the Maker,
who are the diviners: "You must <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> and <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> the means so that man, whom we

"Cast the lot with your grains of corn and tzité. Do it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> and we shall know if we are to

They <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> down at once to make their divination, and cast their lots with the corn and the
tzité. "Fate! Creature!" said an old woman and an old man. And this old <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> was the one who
cast the lots with Tzité, the one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Xpiyacoc. And the old woman was the diviner, the
maker, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Chiracán Xmucané.
Beginning the divination, they said: "Get together, grasp each other! Speak, that we may
hear." They said, "Say if it is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> that the wood be got <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> and that it be carved by the
Creator and the Maker, and if this [man of wood] is he who must nourish and sustain us when
there is <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> when it is day!
"Thou, corn; thou, tzité; thou, fate; thou, creature; get together, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> each other," they said to
the corn, to the tzité, to fate, to the creature. "Come to <span class="t2 t9 t10 t16 t18 t19 t27 t28 hoverable">sacrifice</span> here, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Heart</span> of Heaven; do not
punish Tepeu and Gucumatz!"
Then they talked and spoke the truth: "Your figures of wood shall come out well; they shall
<span class="t9 t11 t20 t21 t22 t23 t27 hoverable">speak</span> and talk on earth."
"So may it be," they answered when they spoke.
And instantly the figures were made of wood. They looked like men, talked like men, and
populated the surface of the earth.
They existed and multiplied; they had daughters, they had sons, these wooden figures; but
they did not have souls, nor minds, they did not remember their Creator, their Maker; they
walked on all fours, aimlessly.
They no longer remembered the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Heart</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Heaven</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> they fell out of favor. It was
merely a trial, an attempt at man. At first they spoke, but their face was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> expression;
their feet and <span class="t13 t23 hoverable">hands</span> had no strength; they had no blood, nor substance, nor moisture, nor
flesh; their cheeks were dry, their feet and <span class="t13 t23 hoverable">hands</span> were dry, and their <span class="t21 hoverable">flesh</span> was yellow.

Therefore, they no longer <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> of their Creator nor their Maker, nor of those who made
them and cared for them.
These were the first <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> who existed in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> numbers on the face of the earth.

Immediately the wooden figures were annihilated, destroyed, broken up, and killed.
A flood was <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> about by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Heart</span> of Heaven; a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> flood was formed which fell on
the heads of the wooden creatures.
Of tzité the <span class="t21 hoverable">flesh</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> was made, but when woman was fashioned by the Creator and the
Maker, her <span class="t21 hoverable">flesh</span> was made of rushes. These were the materials the Creator and the Maker
wanted to <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> in making them.
But those that they had made, that they had created, did not think, did not <span class="t9 t11 t20 t21 t22 t23 t27 hoverable">speak</span> with their
Creator, their Maker. And for this <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> they were killed, they were deluged. A heavy resin
fell from the sky. The one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Xecotcovach came and gouged out their eyes; Camalotz
came and cut off their heads; Cotzbalam came and devoured their flesh. Tucumbalam came,
too, and broke and mangled their bones and their nerves, and ground and crumbled their
bones.
This was to punish them because they had not <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> of their mother, nor their father, the

And for this <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> the face of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> was darkened and a
black rain began to fall, by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> and by night.
Then came the small animals and the large animals, and sticks and stones struck their faces.
And all began to speak: their earthen jars, their griddles, their plates, their pots, their grinding
stones, all rose up and struck their faces.
"You have done us much harm; you ate us, and now we shall kill you," said their dogs and
birds of the barnyard.
And the grinding stones said: "We were tormented by you; every day, every day, at night, at
dawn, all the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> our faces <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> holi, holi, huqui, huqui, because of you. This was the tribute
we paid you. But now that you are no longer men, you shall feel our strength. We shall grind
and tear your <span class="t21 hoverable">flesh</span> to pieces," said their grinding stones.
And then their dogs spoke and said: "Why did you give us nothing to eat? You scarcely
looked at us, but you chased us and threw us out. You always had a stick ready to strike us
while you were eating.
"Thus it was that you treated us. You did not <span class="t9 t11 t20 t21 t22 t23 t27 hoverable">speak</span> to us. Perhaps we shall not kill you now;
but why did you not look ahead, why did you not think about yourselves? Now we shall
destroy you, now you shall feel the teeth of our mouths; we shall devour you," said the dogs,
and then, they destroyed their faces.

And at the same time, their griddles and pots spoke: "Pain and suffering you have caused us.
Our mouths and our faces were blackened with soot; we were always put on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> and you

and they all destroyed their [the wooden men's] faces. The stones of the hearth, which were

pain.
The desperate ones [the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> of wood] ran as quickly as they could; they wanted to climb to
the tops of the houses.
And the houses fell down and threw them to the ground; they wanted to climb to the treetops,
and the trees cast them far away; they wanted to enter the caverns, and the caverns repelled
them.
So was the ruin of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> who had been <span class="t16 hoverable">created</span> and formed, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> made to be destroyed
and annihilated; the mouths and faces of all of them were mangled.
And it is said that their descendants are the monkeys which now live in the forests; these are
all that remain of them because their <span class="t21 hoverable">flesh</span> was made only of wood by the Creator and the
Maker.
And <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> the monkey looks like man, and is an example of a generation of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> which
were <span class="t16 hoverable">created</span> and made but were only wooden figures.

IT WAS CLOUDY AND TWILIGHT THEN ON the face of the earth. There was no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> yet.
Nevertheless, there was a being <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Vucub-Caquix, who was very proud of himself.
The sky and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> existed, but the faces of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> and the moon were covered.
And he [Vucub-Caquix] said: "Truly, they are clear examples of those <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> who were
drowned, and their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> is that of supernatural beings.
"I shall now be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> above all the <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> <span class="t16 hoverable">created</span> and formed. I am the sun, the light, the
moon," he exclaimed. "Great is my splendor. Because of me <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> shall walk and conquer. For
my <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> are of silver, bright, resplendent as precious stones, as emeralds; my teeth shine like
perfect stones, like the face of the sky. My nose shines afar like the moon, my throne is of
silver, and the face of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> is lighted when I <span class="t6 t9 t13 t15 t17 t18 t23 t28 t29 hoverable">pass</span> before my throne.
"So, then, I am the sun, I am the moon, for all mankind. So shall it be, because I can see very
far."
So Vucub-Caquix spoke. But he was not really the sun; he was only vainglorious of his
feathers and his riches. And he could see only as far as the horizon, and he could not see over
all the world.
The face of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> had not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> appeared, nor that of the moon, nor the stars, and it had not
dawned. Therefore, Vucub-Caquix became as vain as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> he were the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> and the moon,

because the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> and the moon had not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> shown itself His only ambition was to
exalt himself and to dominate. And all this happened when the flood came because of the
wooden-people.
Now we shall tell how Vucub-Caquix was overthrown and died, and how <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> was made by

THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF THE DEFEAT and the ruin of the <span class="t0 t7 t21 t27 hoverable">glory</span> of Vucub-Caquix
<span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> about by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> youths, the first of whom was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Hunahpú and the second,
Xbalanqué. They were really gods. When they saw the harm which the arrogant one had done,
and wished to do, in the presence of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Heart</span> of Heaven, the youths said:
"It is not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> that it be so, when <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> does not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> live here on earth. Therefore, we shall try
to shoot him with our blowgun when he is eating. We shall shoot him and make him sicken,
and then that will be the end of his riches, his green stones, his precious metals, his emeralds,
his jewels of which he is so proud. And this shall be the lot of all men, for they must not
become vain, because of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> and riches.
"Thus shall it be," said the youths, each one putting his blowgun to his shoulder.
Well, now Vucub-Caquix had <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> sons: the first was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Zipacná, the <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> was

Well, Zipacná played ball with the large mountains: with Chigag, Hunahpú, Pecul,
Yaxcanul, Macamob, and Huliznab. These are the names of the mountains which existed
when it dawned and which were <span class="t16 hoverable">created</span> in a single night by Zipacná.
In this way, then, Cabracán moved the mountains and made the large and small mountains
tremble.
And in this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t13 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">sons</span> of Vucub-Caquix proclaimed their pride. "Listen! I am the sun!" said
Vucub-Caquix. "I am he who made the earth!" said Zipacná. "I am he who shook the sky and
made the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> tremble!" said Cabracán, In this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t13 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">sons</span> of Vucub-Caquix followed the
example of their father's assumed greatness. And this seemed very <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> to the youths. Neither

Therefore, the deaths of Vucub-Caquix and his <span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t13 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">sons</span> and their destruction was decided <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span>

I. <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">Chapter</span> 6
Now we shall tell how the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> youths shot their blowguns at Vucub-Caquix and how each
one of those, who had become arrogant, was destroyed.
Vucub-Caquix had a large nantze tree and he ate the fruit of it. Each <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> to the tree
and climbed to the top. Hunahpú and Xbalanqué had seen that this fruit was his food. And
they lay in ambush at the foot of the tree, hidden among the leaves. Vucub-Caquix came
straight to his meal of nantzes.
Instantly he was injured by a discharge from Hun-Hunahpú's blowgun which struck him
squarely in the jaw, and screaming, he fell straight to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> from the treetop.
Hun-Hunahpú ran quickly to overpower him, but Vucub-Caquix seized his arm and
wrenching it from him, bent it back to the shoulder. In this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> Vucub-Caquix tore out HunHunahpú's arm. Surely the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> youths did <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> in not letting themselves be defeated first by
Vucub-Caquix.
Carrying Hun-Hunahpú's arm, Vucub-Caquix <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> home, and arrived there nursing his jaw.
"What has happened to you, my lord?" said Chimalmat, his wife.
"What could it be, but those <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> demons who shot me with blowguns and dislocated my jaw?
For that <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> my teeth are loose and pain me very much. But I have <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> it [his arm], to
put it on the fire. Let it hang there over the fire, for surely these demons will come looking for
it." So said Vucub-Caquix as he hung up the arm of Hun-Hunahpú.
Having <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> it over, Hun-Hunahpú and Xbalanqué <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> to talk with an old <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> who had

The youths said to the old woman and the old man:
"Come with us to Vucub-Caquix's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> to get our arm. We will follow you, and you shall

"So Vucub-Caquix shall think we are boys and we shall also be there to advise you," said the

this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> they arrived at the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">lord</span> who was screaming because his tooth pained
him.
When Vucub-Caquix saw the old <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> and the old woman and those who accompanied them,
he asked, "Where do you come from, grandparents?"

"We come looking for something to eat, honorable sir," they answered.
"And what do you eat? Are those not your <span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t13 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">sons</span> who are with you?"
"Oh, no, sir! They are our grandsons; but we are sorry for them and what is given to us, we
share with them, sir," answered the old woman and the old man.
Meanwhile, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">lord</span> was suffering terrible pain from his tooth, and it was only with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>
difficulty that he could speak.
"I earnestly beseech you to have pity on me. What can you do? What do you know how to
cure?" the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">lord</span> asked them.
And the old ones answered, "Oh, sir! we only <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> the worm from the teeth, cure the eyes, and
<span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> bones."
"Very well. Cure my teeth, which are really making me suffer <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> and night, and because of
them and of my <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> I cannot be calm and cannot sleep. All of this is because <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> demons
shot me with a pellet [from their blowgun] and for that <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> I cannot eat. Have pity on me,
then, tighten my teeth with your hands."
"Very well, sir. It is a worm which makes you suffer. It will end when these teeth are pulled
and others put in their place."
"It is not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> that you pull my teeth, because it is only with them that I am a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">lord</span> and all my
ornaments are my teeth and my eyes."
"'We will put others of ground bone in their place." But the ground bone was nothing but
grains of white corn.
"Very well, pull them out, come and relieve me," he replied.
Then they pulled Vucub-Caquix's teeth; but in their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> they put only grains of white corn,
and these grains of corn shone in his mouth. Instantly his features sagged and he no longer
looked like a lord. They removed the rest of his teeth which shone like pearls in his mouth.
And finally they cured Vucub-Caquix's eyes, piercing the pupils of his eyes, and they <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> all
his riches.
But he felt nothing any more. He only watched, because at the advice of Hunahpú and
Xbalanqué, they <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> from him all of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> of which he had been so proud.
Then Vucub-Caquix died. Hun-Hunahpú recovered his arm. Chimalmat, the wife of VucubCaquix, also perished.
In this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> Vucub-Caquix lost his riches. The healer <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> all the emeralds and precious stones
which had been his pride here on earth.
The old woman and the old <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> who did this were miraculous beings; and having recovered
the arm of Hun-Hunahpú, they put it in place, and it was all right again.

It was only to <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> about the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">death</span> of Vucub-Caquix that they did this, because it seemed
wicked to them that he should become so arrogant.
And then the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> youths <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> on, having in this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> carried out the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Heart</span> of

I. <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">Chapter</span> 7
Here now are the deeds of Zipacná the elder <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> of Vucub-Caquix.
"I am the creator of the mountains," said Zipacná.
Zipacná was bathing at the edge of a river when four hundred youths passed dragging a log to
support their house. The four hundred were walking, after having cut down a large tree to
make the ridge-pole of their house.
Then Zipacná came up, and going toward the four hundred youths, said to them: "What are
you doing, boys?"
"It is only this log," they answered, "which we cannot lift and carry on our shoulders."
"I will carry it. Where does it have to go? What do you want it for?"
"For a ridge-pole for our house."
"All right," he answered, and lifting it up, he put it on his shoulders and carried it to the
entrance of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> of the four hundred boys.
"Now stay with us, boy," they said. "Have you a mother or father;"
"I have neither," he answered.
"Then we shall hire you tomorrow to prepare another log to support our house."
"Good," he answered.
The four hundred boys talked <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> then. and said:
"How shall we kill this boy? Because it is not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> what he has done lifting the log alone. Let
us make a big hole and push him so that he will fall into it. 'Go down and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> out the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span>
and carry it from the pit,' we shall tell him. and when he stoops down, to go down into the pit,
we shall let the large log fall on him and he will die there in the pit."
So said the four hundred boys, and then they dug a large, very deep pit. Then they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span>
Zipacná.
"We like you very much. Go, go and dig dirt, for we cannot reach [the bottom of the pit],"
they said.

"All right," he answered. He <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> at once into the pit. And calling to him as he was digging
the dirt, they said: "Have you gone down very deep yet?"
"Yes," he answered beginning to dig the pit. But the pit which he was making was to save him
from danger. He knew that they wanted to kill him; so when he dug the pit, he made a <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span>
hole at one <span class="t6 hoverable">side</span> in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> to <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> himself.
"How far [have you gone]?" the four hundred boys <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> down.
"I am still digging; I will <span class="t3 t11 t18 t27 hoverable">call</span> up to you when I have finished the digging," said Zipacná from
the bottom of the pit. But he was not digging his grave; instead he was opening another pit in
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> to save himself.
At last Zipacná <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> to them. But when he called, he was already safe in the <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> pit.
"Come and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> out and carry away the dirt which I have dug and which is in the bottom of
the pit," he said, "because in <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> I have made it very deep. Do you not hear my call?
Nevertheless, your calls, your <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> repeat themselves like an echo once, twice, and so I hear
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> where you are." So Zipacná <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> from the pit where he was hidden, shouting from the
depths.
Then the boys hurled the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> log violently, and it fell quickly with a thud to the bottom of
the pit.
"Let no one speak! Let us wait until we hear his dying screams," they said to each other,
whispering, and each one covered his face as the log fell noisily. He [Zipacná] spoke then,
crying out, but he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> only once when the log fell to the bottom.
"How <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> we have succeeded in this! Now he is dead," said the boys. "if, unfortunately, he
had continued what he had begun to do, we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have been lost, because he already had
interfered with us, the four hundred boys."
And filled with joy they said: "Now we must make our chicha <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the next <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> days.
When the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">days</span> are passed, we shall drink to the construction of our new house, we, the,
four hundred boys." Then they said: "Tomorrow we shall look, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> after tomorrow, we
shall also look to see if the ants do not come out of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> when the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> smells and begins
to rot. Presently we shall become calm and drink our chicha," they said.
But from his pit Zipacná listened to everything the boys said. And later, on the <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> day,
multitudes of ants came, going and coming and gathering under the log. Some carried
Zipacná's hair in their mouths and others carried his fingernails.
When the boys saw this, they said, "That devil has now perished. Look how the ants have
gathered, how they have come by hordes, some bringing his hair and others his fingernails.
Look what we have done!" So they spoke to each other.
Nevertheless, Zipacná was very much alive. He had cut his hair and gnawed off his
fingernails to give them to the ants.

And so the four hundred boys believed that he was dead, and on the <span class="t7 hoverable">third</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> they began the
orgy and all of the boys got drunk. And the four hundred being drunk knew nothing any more.
And then Zipacná let the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> fall on their heads and killed all of them.
Not even one or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> among the four hundred were saved; they were killed by Zipacná, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> of

Now we shall tell how Zipacná was defeated by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> boys, Hunahpú and Xbalanqué.

The boys' hearts were <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span> of rancor because the four hundred young <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> had been killed by
Zipacná. And he only hunted fish and crabs at the bank of the river, which were his daily
food. During the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> about looking for food, and at night he carried mountains on his
back.
With a leaf of the ec plant which is found in the forest, Hunahpú and Xbalanqué quickly made
a figure to look like a very large crab.
With this they made the stomach of the crab; the claws, they made of pahac, and for the shell,
which covers the back, they <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> a stone. Then they put the crab at the bottom of a cave at the
foot of a large mountain <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Meaguán, where he was overcome.
Then the boys <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> to <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> Zipacná on the river bank.
"Where are you going, young man?" they asked him.
"I am not going anywhere," Zipacná answered, "only looking for food, boys."
"And what is your food?"
"Fish and crabs, but there are none here and I have not found any; I have not eaten since <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span>
before yesterday, and I am dying of hunger," said Zipacná to Hunahpú and Xbalanqué.
"Over there in the bottom of the ravine there is a crab, a really large crab, and it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span>
if you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> <span class="t28 hoverable">eat</span> it! Only it bit us when we tried to catch it and so we were afraid. We
wouldn't try to catch it for anything," said Hunahpú and Xbalanqué.
"Have pity on me! Come and show it to me, boys," begged Zipacná.
"We do not want to. You go alone, you will not get lost. Follow the bank of the river and you
will come out at the foot of a large hill; there it is making a noise at the bottom of the ravine.
You have only to go there," said Hunahpú and Xbalanqué.

"Oh, unfortunate me! Won't you accompany me, boys? Come and show it to me. There are
many birds which you can shoot with your blowguns and I know where to <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> them," said
Zipacná.
His meekness convinced the boys. And they asked him: But, can you really catch him?
Because it is only for you that we are returning; we are not going to try to get it again because
it bit us when we were crawling into the cave. After that we were afraid to crawl in, but we
almost caught it. So, then, it is best that you crawl in," they said.
"Very well," said Zipacná, and then they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> with him. They arrived at the bottom of the
ravine and there, stretched on his back, was the crab, showing his red shell. And there also in
the bottom of the ravine was the boys' hoax.
"Good! Good!" said Zipacná happily. "I should like to have it in my mouth already!" And he
was really dying of hunger. He wanted to try to crawl in, he wanted to enter, but the crab was
climbing. He came out at once and the boys asked, "Did you not get it?"
"No," he answered," because he was going up and I almost caught him. But perhaps it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span>
be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> if I go in from above," he added. And then he entered again from above, but as he
was almost inside, with only the soles of his feet showing, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> hill slid and fell slowly
down on his chest.
Zipacná never returned and he was changed into stone.
In this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> Zipacná was defeated by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> boys, Hunahpú and Xbalanqué; he was the elder

mountains.
At the foot of the hill <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Meaguán he was vanquished. Only by a miracle was he
vanquished, the <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> of the arrogant ones. One was left, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> history we shall tell now.

The <span class="t7 hoverable">third</span> of the arrogant ones was the <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> of Vucub-Caquix who was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Cabracán.
"I demolish the mountains," he said.
But Hunahpú and Xbalanqué also defeated Cabracán. Huracán, Chipi-Caculhá, and RaxaCaculhá talked and said to Hunahpú and Xbalanqué:
"Let the <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> of Vucub-Caquix also be defeated. This is our will, for it is not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> what
they do on earth, exalting their glory, their grandeur, and their power, and it must not be so.
Lure him to where the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> rises," said Huracán to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> youths.
"Very well, honored sir," they answered, "because what we see is not right. Do you not exist,
you who are the peace, you, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Heart</span> of Heaven?" said the boys as they listened to the command
of Huracán.

Meanwhile, Cabracán was busy shaking the mountains. At the gentlest tap of his feet on the
earth, the large and small mountains opened. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> the boys found him and asked Cabracán:
"Where are you going, young man?
"Nowhere," he answered," here I am moving the mountains, and I am leveling them to the
ground forever," he answered.
Then Cabracán asked Hunahpú and Xbalanqué, "What did you come to do here? I do not
recognize you. What are your names?" said Cabracán.
"We have no names," they answered, "we are nothing more than shooters of blowguns and
hunters with bird-traps on the mountains. We are poor and we have nothing, young man. We
only walk over the large and small mountains, young man, and we have just seen a large
mountain, over there where you see the pink sky. It really rises up very <span class="t23 hoverable">high</span> and overlooks the
tops of all the hills. So it is that we have not been able to catch even one or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> of the birds on
it, boy. But, is it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> that you can level all the mountains?" Hunahpú and Xbalanqué asked
Cabracán.
"Have you really seen the mountain of which you speak? Where is it? If I see it, I shall
demolish it. Where did you see it?"
"Over there it is, where the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> rises," said Hunahpú and Xbalanqué.
"Very well, show me the road," he said to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> boys.
"Oh no!" they answered. "We must <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> you between us. One shall go at your <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> and the
other at your right, because we have our blowguns, and if there should be birds we can shoot
them." And so they <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> out happily, trying out their blowguns. But when they shot with them,
they did not <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> the clay pellets in the tube of the blowgun; instead they felled the birds only
with the puff of air when they shot them, which surprised Cabracán very much.
Then the boys built a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> and put the birds on it to roast, but they rubbed one of the birds with
chalk, covering it with a white <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> soil.
"We shall give him this," they said, "to whet his appetite with the odor which it gives off. This
bird of ours shall be his ruin, as we cover this bird with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> so we shall <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> him down to
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> and bury him in the earth.
"Great shall be the <span class="t12 t20 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">wisdom</span> of a <span class="t16 hoverable">created</span> being, of a being fashioned, when it dawns, when
there is light," said the boys.
"As it is natural for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> to wish to eat, so Cabracán desires food," said Hunahpú and
Xbalanqué to each other.
Meanwhile the birds were roasting, they were beginning to turn golden brown, and the fat and
juice which dripped from them made an appetizing odor. Cabracán wanted very much to <span class="t28 hoverable">eat</span>
them; they made his mouth water, he yawned, and the saliva and spittle drooled because of
the smell which the birds gave off.

Then he asked them: "What is that you eat? The smell is really savoury. Give me a little
piece," he said to them.
Then they gave a bird to Cabracán, the one which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be his ruin; and when he had
finished eating it, they <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> out toward the east where the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> mountain was. But already
Cabracán's legs and <span class="t13 t23 hoverable">hands</span> were weakening and he had no strength because of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> with
which the bird he had eaten was rubbed, and he could do nothing to the mountains. Neither
was it possible to level them.
Then the boys tied him, they tied his <span class="t13 t23 hoverable">hands</span> behind him and also tied his neck and his feet
together. Then they threw him to the ground and there they buried him.
In this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> Cabracán was overcome by Hunahpú and Xbalanqué.

Now we shall tell of the birth of Hunahpú and Xbalanqué, having first told of the destruction
of Vucub-Caquix and that of Zipacná and of Cabracán, here on earth.

painters, sculptors, jewelers, silversmiths; these were Hunbatz and Hunchouén.
Well, Hun-Hunahpú and Vucub-Hunahpú did nothing but play dice and ball A <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> long; and

And having gone to play ball on the road to Xibalba, they were overheard by Hun-Camé and
Vucub-Camé, the lords of Xibalba.
"What are they doing on earth? Who are they who are making the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> shake, and making so

them! We are no longer respected by them. They no longer have consideration, or <span class="t28 hoverable">fear</span> of our

All of them held a council. Those <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Hun-Camé and Vucub-Camé were the supreme

And having gathered in council, they discussed how to torment and wound Hun-Hunahpú and
Vucub-Hunahpú. What the Lords of Xibalba coveted were the playing implements of HunHunahpú and Vucub-Hunahpú-their leather pads and rings and gloves and crown and masks
which were the playing gear of Hun-Hunahpú and Vucub-Hunahpú.
Now we shall tell of their journey to Xibalba and how they <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> behind them the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t13 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">sons</span> of HunHunahpú, Hunbatz, and [Hun] Chouén, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> mother had died.
Then we shall tell how Hunbatz and Hunchouén were overcome by Hunahpú and Xbalanqué.

THE messengers of Hun-Camé and Vucub-Camé arrived immediately.
"Go, Ahpop Achih!" they were told. "Go and <span class="t3 t11 t18 t27 hoverable">call</span> Hun-Hunahpú and Vucub-Hunahpú. Say to
them, 'Come with us. The lords say that you must come.' They must come here to play ball
with us so that they shall make us happy, for really they amaze us. So, then, they must come,"
said the lords. "And have them <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> their playing gear, their rings, their gloves, and have

messengers.
And these messengers were owls: Chabi-Tucur, Huracán-Tucur, Caquix-Tucur and HolomTucur. These were the names of the messengers of Xibalba.
Chabi-Tucur was swift as an arrow; Huracán-Tucur had only one leg; Caquix-Tucur had a red
back, and Holom-Tucur had only a head, no legs, but he had wings.
The four messengers had the rank of Ahpop-Achih. Leaving Xibalba, they arrived quickly,
bringing their message to the court where Hun-Hunahpú and Vucub-Hunahpú were playing
ball, at the ball-court which was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Nim-Xob-Carchah. The owl messengers <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> directly
to the ball-court and delivered their message exactly as it was given to them by Hun-Camé,
Vucub-Camé, Ahalpuh, Ahalganá, Chamiabac, Chamiaholom, Xiquiripat, Cuchumaquic,
Ahalmez, Ahaltocob, Xic, and Patán, as the lords were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> who sent the message by the
owls.
"Did the Lords Hun-Camé and Vucub-Camé really say that we must go with you?"
"They certainly said so, and 'Let them <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> all their playing gear,' the lords said."
"Very well," said the youths. "Wait for us, we are only going to say good-bye to our mother."
And having gone straight home, they said to their mother, for their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">father</span> was dead: "We are

"We shall leave our ball here in pledge," they added. They <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> immediately to hang it in the
space under the rooftree. "We will return to play," they said.
And going to Hunbatz and Hunchouén they said to them: "Keep on playing the flute and
singing, painting, and carving; warm our <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> and warm the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> of your grandmother."
When they <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> leave of their mother, Xmucané was moved and burst into tears. "Do not
worry, we are going, but we have not died yet," said Hun-Hunahpú and Vucub-Hunahpú as
they left.
Hun-Hunahpú and Vucub-Hunahpú <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> immediately and the messengers <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> them on the
road. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> they were descending the road to Xibalba, by some very steep stairs. They <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span>
down until they came to the bank of a river which flowed rapidly between the ravines <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span>
Nuziván cul and Cuziván, and crossed it. Then they crossed the river which flows among

thorny calabash trees. There were very many calabash trees, but they passed through them
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> hurting themselves.
Then they came to the bank of a river of blood and crossed it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> drinking its waters; they
only <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> to the river bank and so they were not overcome. They <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> on until they came to
where four roads joined, and there at the crossroads they were overcome.
One of the four roads was red, another black, another white, and another yellow. And the
black road said to them: "I am the one you must <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> because I am the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> of the Lord." So
said the road.
And from here on they were already overcome. They were <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> over the road to Xibalba and
when they arrived at the council room of the Lords of Xibalba, they had already lost the
match.
Well, the first ones who were seated there were only figures of wood, arranged by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> of
Xibalba. These they greeted first:
"How are you, Hun-Camé?" they said to the wooden man. "How are you, Vucub-Camé?" they
said to the other wooden man. But they did not answer. instantly the Lords of Xibalba burst
into laughter and all the other lords began to laugh loudly, because they already <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> for
granted the downfall and defeat of Hun-Hunahpú and Vucub-Hunahpú. And they continued to
laugh.
Then Hun-Camé and Vucub-Camé spoke: "Very well," they said. "You have come.
Tomorrow you shall prepare the mask, your rings, and your gloves," they said.
"Come and sit down on our bench," they said. But the bench which they offered them was of
hot stone, and when they sat down they were burned. They began to squirm around on the
bench, and if they had not stood up they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have burned their seats.
The Lords of Xibalba burst out laughing again; they were dying of laughter; they writhed
from pain in their stomach, in their blood, and in their bones, caused by their laughter, all the
Lords of Xibalba laughed.
"Go now to that house," they said. "There you will get your sticks of fat pine and your cigar
and there you shall sleep."
Immediately they arrived at the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">House</span> of Gloom. There was only darkness <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the house.
Meanwhile the Lords of Xibalba discussed what they should do.
"Let us <span class="t2 t9 t10 t16 t18 t19 t27 t28 hoverable">sacrifice</span> them tomorrow, let them die quickly, quickly, so that we can have their
playing gear to <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> in play," said the Lords of Xibalba to each other.
Well, their fat-pine sticks were round and were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> zaquitoc, which is the pine of Xibalba.
Their fat-pine sticks were pointed and filed and were as bright as bone; the pine of Xibalba
was very hard.
Hun-Hunahpú and Vucub-Hunahpú entered the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">House</span> of Gloom. There they were given their
fat-pine sticks, a single lighted stick which Hun-Camé and Vucub-Camé sent them, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span>

with a lighted cigar for each of them which the lords had sent. They <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> to give them to
Hun-Hunahpú and Vucub-Hunahpú.
They found them crouching in the darkness when the porters arrived with the fat-pine sticks
and the cigars. As they entered, the pine sticks lighted the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> brightly.
"Each of you <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> your pine sticks and your cigars; come and <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> them back at dawn, you
must not burn them up, but you must return them whole; this is what the lords told us to say."
So they said. And so they were defeated. They burned up the pine sticks, and they also
finished the cigars which had been given to them.
There were many punishments in Xibalba; the punishments were of many kinds.
The first was the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">House</span> of Gloom, Quequma-ha, in which there was only darkness.
The <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> was Xuxulim-ha, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> where everybody shivered, in which it was very cold.
A cold, unbearable wind blew within.
The <span class="t7 hoverable">third</span> was the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">House</span> of Jaguars, Balami-ha, it was called, in which there were nothing but
jaguars which stalked about, jumped around, roared, and made fun. The jaguars were shut up
in the house.
Zotzi-há, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">House</span> of Bats, the fourth <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> of punishment was called. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">Within</span> this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span>
there were nothing but bats which squeaked and cried and flew around and around. The bats
were shut in and could not get out.
The fifth was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Chayim-há, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">House</span> of Knives, in which there were only sharp, pointed
knives, silent or grating against each other in the house.
There were many places of torture in Xibalba, but Hun-Hunahpú and Vucub-Hunahpú did not
enter them. We only mention the names of these houses of punishment.
When Hun-Hunahpú and Vucub-Hunahpú came before Hun-Camé and Vucub-Camé, they
said: "Where are my cigars? Where are my sticks of fat pine which I gave you last night?"
"They are all gone, Sir."
"Well. Today shall be the end of your days. Now you shall die. You shall be destroyed, we
will break you into pieces and here your faces will stay hidden. You shall be sacrificed," said
Hun-Camé and Vucub-Camé.
They sacrificed them immediately and buried them in the Pucbal-Chah, as it was called.
Before burying them, they cut off the <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> of Hun-Hunahpú and buried the older brother
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> with the younger brother.
"Take the <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> and put it in that tree which is Planted on the road," said Hun-Camé and
Vucub-Camé. And having put the <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> in the tree, instantly the tree, which had never borne
fruit before the <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> of Hun-Hunahpú was placed among its branches, was covered with fruit.
And this calabash tree, it is said, is the one which we now <span class="t3 t11 t18 t27 hoverable">call</span> the <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> of Hun-Hunahpú.

Hun-Camé and Vucub-Camé looked in amazement at the fruit on the tree. The round fruit was
everywhere; but they did not recognize the <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> of Hun-Hunahpú; it was exactly like the
other fruit of the calabash tree. So it seemed to all of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> of Xibalba when they came to
look at it.
According to their judgment, the tree was miraculous, because of what had instantly occurred
when they put Hun-Hunahpú's <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> among its branches. And the Lords of Xibalba said:
"Let no one come to pick this fruit. Let no one come and sit under this tree!" they said, and so
the Lords of Xibalba resolved to keep everybody away.
The <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> of Hun-Hunahpú did not appear again because it had become one and the same as
the fruit of the gourd tree. Nevertheless, a girl <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> the wonderful story. Now we shall tell
about her arrival.

II. <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">Chapter</span> 3
THIS is the story of a maiden, the daughter of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">lord</span> named Cuchumaquic.
A maiden, then, daughter of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">lord</span> <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> this story. The name of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">father</span> was Cuchumaquic
and that of the maiden was Xquic. When she <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> the story of the fruit of the tree which her
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">father</span> told, she was amazed to hear it.
"Why can I not go to see this tree which they tell about?" the girl exclaimed. "Surely the fruit
of which I hear tell must be very good." Finally she <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> alone and arrived at the foot of the
tree which was planted in Pucbal-Chah.
"Ah!" she exclaimed. "What fruit is this which this tree bears? Is it not wonderful to see how
it is covered with fruit? Must I die, shall I be lost, if I pick one of this fruit?" said the maiden.
Then the skull which was among the branches of the tree spoke up and said: "What is it you
wish? Those round objects which cover the branches of the trees are nothing but skulls." So
spoke the <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> of Hun-Hunahpú turning to the maiden. "Do you, perchance, want them?" it
added.
"Yes, I want them," the maiden answered.
"Very well," said the skull. "Stretch your right <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> up here."
"Very well," said the maiden, and with her right <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> reached toward the skull.
In that instant the skull let a few drops of spittle fall directly into the maiden's palm. She
looked quickly and intently at the palm of her hand, but the spittle of the skull was not there.
"In my saliva and spittle I have given you my descendants," said the <span class="t23 hoverable">voice</span> in the tree. "Now
my <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> has nothing on it any more, it is nothing but a skull <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> flesh. So are the heads of
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> princes, the <span class="t21 hoverable">flesh</span> is all which gives them a handsome appearance. And when they
die, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> are frightened by their bones. So, too, is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of the sons, which are like saliva
and spittle, they may be <span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t13 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">sons</span> of a lord, of a <span class="t8 t12 t17 hoverable">wise</span> man, or of an orator. They do not lose their

substance when they go, but they bequeath it; the image of the lord, of the <span class="t8 t12 t17 hoverable">wise</span> man, or of the
orator does not. disappear, nor is it lost, but he leaves it to the daughters and to the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t13 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">sons</span> which
he begets. I have done the same with you. Go up, then, to the surface of the earth, that you
may not die. Believe in my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> that it will be so," said the <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> of Hun-Hunahpú and of
Vucub-Hunahpú.
And all that they did <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> was by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> of Huracán, Chipi-Caculhá, and Raxa-Caculhá.
After all of the above talking, the maiden returned directly to her home, having immediately
conceived the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t13 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">sons</span> in her belly by virtue of the spittle only. And <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> Hunahpú and Xbalanqué
were begotten.
And so the girl returned home, and after six months had passed, her father, who was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span>
Cuchumaquic, noticed her condition. At once the maiden's secret was discovered by her <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">father</span>
when he observed that she was pregnant.
Then the lords, Hun-Camé and Vucub-Camé, held council with Cuchumaquic.
"My daughter is pregnant, Sirs; she has been disgraced," exclaimed Cuchumaquic when he
appeared before the lords.
"Very well," they said. "Command her to tell the truth, and if she refuses to speak, punish her;
let her be <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> far from here and <span class="t2 t9 t10 t16 t18 t19 t27 t28 hoverable">sacrifice</span> her."
"Very well, Honorable Lords," he answered. Then he questioned his daughter: "Whose are the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">children</span> that you carry, my daughter?" And she answered, "I have no child, my father, for I
have not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> known a youth."
'Very well," he replied. "You are really a whore. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Take</span> her and <span class="t2 t9 t10 t16 t18 t19 t27 t28 hoverable">sacrifice</span> her, Ahpop Achih;
<span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> me her <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> in a gourd and return this very <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> before the lords," he said to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span>
owls.
The four messengers <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> the gourd and <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> out carrying the young girl in their arms and also
taking the knife of flint with which to <span class="t2 t9 t10 t16 t18 t19 t27 t28 hoverable">sacrifice</span> her.
And she said to them: "It cannot be that you will kill me, oh, messengers, because what I bear
in my belly is no disgrace, but was begotten when I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> to marvel at the <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> of HunHunahpú which was in Pucbal-Chah. So, then, you must not <span class="t2 t9 t10 t16 t18 t19 t27 t28 hoverable">sacrifice</span> me, oh, messengers!"
said the young girl, turning to them.
"And what shall we put in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> of your heart? Your <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">father</span> told us: 'Bring the heart, return
before the lords, do your duty, all working together, <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> it in the gourd quickly, and put the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> in the bottom of the gourd.' Perchance, did he not <span class="t9 t11 t20 t21 t22 t23 t27 hoverable">speak</span> to us so? What shall we put in
the gourd? We wish too, that you should not die," said the messengers.
"Very well, but my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> does not belong to them. Neither is your home here, nor must you let
them force you to kill men. Later, in truth, the real criminals will be at your mercy and I will
overcome Hun-Camé and Vucub-Camé. So, then, the blood and only the blood shall be theirs
and shall be given to them. Neither shall my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> be burned before them. Gather the product
of this tree," said the maiden.

The red sap gushing forth from the tree fell in the gourd and with it they made a ball which
glistened and <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> the shape of a heart. The tree gave forth sap similar to blood, with the
appearance of real blood. Then the blood, or that is to say the sap of the red tree, clotted, and
formed a very bright coating inside the gourd, like clotted blood; meanwhile the tree glowed
at the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> of the maiden. It was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the "red tree of cochineal," but [since then] it has
<span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> the name of Blood Tree because its sap is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Blood.
"There on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> you shall be beloved and you shall have all that belongs to you," said the
maiden to the owls.
"Very well, girl. We shall go there, we go up to serve you; you, continue on your way, while
we go to present the sap, instead of your heart, to the lords," said the messengers.
When they arrived in the presence of the lords, all were waiting.
"You have finished?" asked Hun-Camé.
"All is finished, my lords. Here in the bottom of the gourd is the heart."
"Very well. Let us see," exclaimed Hun-Camé. And grasping it with his fingers he raised it,
the shell broke and the blood flowed bright red in color.
"Stir up the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> and put it on the coals," said Hun-Camé.
As soon as they threw it on the fire, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> of Xibalba began to sniff and drawing near to it,
they found the fragrance of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> very sweet.
And as they sat deep in thought, the owls, the maiden's servants, left, and flew like a flock of
birds from the abyss toward <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> and the four became her servants.
In this manner the Lords of Xibalba were defeated. All were tricked by the maiden.

II. <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">Chapter</span> 4
Well, then, Hunbatz and Hunchouén were with their mother when the woman <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Xquic
arrived.
When the woman Xquic came before the mother of Hunbatz and Hunchouén, she carried her
<span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t13 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">sons</span> in her belly and it was not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> before Hunahpú and Xbalanqué, as they were called,
were to be born.
When the woman came to the old lady, she said to her: "I have come, mother; I am your
daughter-in-law and your daughter, mother." She said this when she entered the grandmother's
house.
"Where did you come from? Where are my sons? Did they, perchance, not die in Xibalba? Do
you not see these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> who remain, their descendants and blood, and are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Hunbatz and
Hunchouén. Go from here! Get out!" the old lady screamed at the girl.

"Nevertheless, it is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> that I am your daughter-in-law; I have been for a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> time. I belong
to Hun-Hunahpú. They live in what I carry, Hun-Hunahpú and Vucub-Hunahpú are not dead;
they will return to show themselves clearly, my mother-in-law. And you shall soon see their
image in what I <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> to you," she said to the old woman.
Then Hunbatz and Hunchouén became angry. They did nothing but play the flute and sing,
paint, and sculpture all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> and were the consolation of the old woman.
Then the old woman said: "I do not wish you to be my daughter-in-law, because what you
bear in your womb is fruit of your disgrace. Furthermore, you are an impostor; my <span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t13 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">sons</span> of
whom you <span class="t9 t11 t20 t21 t22 t23 t27 hoverable">speak</span> are already dead."
Presently the grandmother added: "This, that I tell you is the truth; but well, it is all right, you
are my daughter-in-law, according to what I have heard. Go, then, <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> the <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> for those
who must be fed. Go and gather a large net [full of corn] and return at once, since you are my
daughter-in-law, according to what I hear," she said to the girl.
"Very well," the girl replied, and she <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> at once to the cornfield which Hunbatz and
Hunchouén had planted. They had opened the road and the girl <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> it and so came to the
cornfield; but she found only one stalk of corn; there were not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> or three, and when she saw
that there was only one stalk with an ear on it, the girl became very anxious.
"Ah, sinner that I am, unfortunate me! Where must I go to get a net <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span> of corn as she told me
to do?" she exclaimed. Immediately she began to beg Chahal for the <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> which she had to
get and must <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> back.
"Xtoh, Xcanil, Xcacau, you who cook the corn; and you, Chahal, guardian of the <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> of
Hunbatz and Hunchouén!" said the girl. And then she seized the beards, the red silk of the
ears of corn and pulled them off <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> picking the ear. Then she arranged the silk in the net
like ears of corn and the large net was completely filled.
The girl returned immediately; the animals of the field <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> along carrying the net, and when
they arrived, they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> to put the load in a corner of the house, as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> she might have
carried it. The old woman came and when she saw the corn in the large net she exclaimed:
"Where have you <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> all this corn from? Did you, perchance, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> all the corn in our field
and <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> it all in? I shall go at once to see," said the old woman, and she <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> out on the road
to the cornfield. But the one stalk of corn was still standing there, and she saw too where the
net had been at the foot of the stalk. The old woman quickly returned to her <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> and said to
the girl:
"This is proof enough that you are really my daughter-in-law. I shall now see your little ones,
those whom you carry and who also are to be soothsayers," she said to the girl.

II. <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">Chapter</span> 5
Now we shall tell of the birth of Hunahpú and Xbalanqué. Here, then, we shall tell about their
birth.
When the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> of their birth arrived, the girl named Xquic gave birth; but the grandmother did
not see them when they were born. Instantly the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> boys <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Hunahpú and Xbalanqué
were born. There in the wood they were born.
Then they came to the house, but they could not sleep.
"Go throw them out! "said the old woman, "because truly they cry very much." Then they
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> and put them on an ant-hill. There they slept peacefully. Then they <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> them from the
ant-hill and laid them on thistles.
Now, what Hunbatz and Hunchouén wished was that they [Hunahpú and Xbalanqué] <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span>
die there on the ant-hill, or on the thistles. They wished this because of the hatred and envy
Hunbatz and Hunchouén felt for them.
At first they refused to receive their younger brothers in the house; they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> not recognize
them and so they were <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> up in the fields.
Hunbatz and Hunchouén were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> musicians and singers; they had grown up in the midst of
trials and want and they had had much trouble, but they became very wise. They were
flautists, singers, painters, and carvers; all of this they knew how to do.
They had <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> about their birth and knew also that they were the successors of their parents,
those who <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> to Xibalba and died there. Hunbatz and Hunchouén were diviners, and in their
hearts they knew everything concerning the birth of their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> younger brothers. Nevertheless,
because they were envious, they did not show their wisdom, and their hearts were filled with
bad will for them, although Hunahpú and Xbalanqué had not offended them in any way.
These <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> [last] did nothing all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> but shoot their blowguns; they were not loved by
their grandmother, nor by Hunbatz, nor by Hunchouén; they were given nothing to eat; only
when the meal was ended and Hunbatz and Hunchouén had already eaten, then the younger
brothers came to eat. But they did not become angry, nor did they become vexed, but suffered
silently, because they knew their rank, and they understood everything clearly. They <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span>
their birds when they came, and Hunbatz and Hunchouén ate them <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> giving anything to
either of the two, Hunahpú and Xbalanqué.
The only <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> that Hunbatz and Hunchouén did was to play the flute and sing.
And once when Hunahpú and Xbalanqué came <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> bringing any bird at all, they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> into
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> and their grandmother became furious.
"Why did you <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> no birds?" she said to Hunahpú and Xbalanqué.

And they answered: "What happened, grandmother, is that our birds were caught in the tree
and we could not climb up to get them, dear grandmother. If our elder brothers so wish, let
them come with us to <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> the birds down," they said.
"Very well," the older brothers answered, "we shall go with you at dawn."
The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> younger brothers then discussed the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> to overcome Hunbatz and Hunchouén. "We
shall only change their nature, their appearance; and so let our <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> be fulfilled, for all the
suffering that they have caused us. They wanted us to die, that we might be lost, we, their
younger brothers. In their hearts they really believe that we have come to be their servants.
For these reasons we shall overcome them and teach them a lesson." <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> they spoke.
Then they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> toward the foot of the tree <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Canté. They were accompanied by their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span>
elder brothers and they were shooting their blowguns. It was not possible to count the birds
which sang in the tree, and their elder brothers marveled to see so many birds. There were
birds, but not one fell at the foot of the tree.
"Our birds do not fall to the ground. Go and fetch them down," they said to their elder
brothers.
"Very well," the latter answered. And then they climbed the tree; but the tree became larger
and the trunk swelled. Then Hunbatz and Hunchouén wanted to come down but they could
not come down from the top of the tree.
Then they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> from the treetop. "What has happened to us, our brothers? Unfortunate we.
This tree frightens us only to look at it. Oh, our brothers!" they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> from the treetop. And
Hunahpú and Xbalanqué answered: "Loosen your breechclouts; tie them below your stomach,
leaving the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> ends hanging and pull these from behind, and in this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> you can walk
easily." <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> said the younger brothers.
"Very well," they answered, pulling the ends of their belts back, but instantly these were
changed into tails and they <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> on the appearance of monkeys. Then they hopped over the
branches of the trees, among the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> woods and little woods, and they buried themselves in
the forest, making faces and swinging in the branches of the trees.
In this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> Hunbatz and Hunchouén were overcome by Hunahpú and Xbalanqué; and only
because of their magic could they have done it.
Then they returned to their home, and when they arrived they spoke to their grandmother and
their mother, and said to them: "What could it be, grandmother, that has happened to our elder
brothers, that suddenly their faces turned into the faces of animals?" So they said.
"If you have done any harm to your elder brothers, you have hurt me and have filled me with
sadness. Do not do such a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> to your brothers, oh, my children," said the old woman to
Hunahpú and Xbalanqué.
And they replied to their grandmother:

"Do not grieve, our grandmother. You shall see our brother's faces again; they shall return, but
it will be a difficult trial for you, grandmother. Be careful that you do not laugh at them. And
now, let us cast our lot," they said.
Immediately they began to play their flutes, playing the song of Hunahpú-Qoy. Then they
sang, playing the flute and drum, picking up their flutes and their drum. Afterward they sat
down close to their grandmother and continued playing and calling back [their brothers] with
music and song, intoning the song, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Hunahpú-Qoy.
At last, Hunbatz and Hunchouén came and began to dance; but when the old woman saw their
ugly faces, she began to laugh, unable to control her laughter, and they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> away at once and
she did not see their faces again.
"Now you see, grandmother! They have gone to the forest. What have you done, grandmother
of ours? We may make this trial but four times and only <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> are left. Let us <span class="t3 t11 t18 t27 hoverable">call</span> them [back
again] with flute and with song, but you, try to control your laughter. Let the trial begin!" said
Hunahpú and Xbalanqué.
Immediately they began again to play. Hunbatz and Hunchouén returned dancing, and came
as far as the center of the court of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> grimacing and provoking their grandmother to
laughter, until finally she broke into loud laughter. They were really very amusing with their
monkey faces, their broad bottoms, their narrow tails, and the hole of their stomach. all of
which made the old woman laugh.
Again the [elder brothers] <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> back to the woods. And Hunahpú and Xbalanqué said: "And
now what shall we do, grandmother? We shall try once again, this <span class="t7 hoverable">third</span> time."
They played the flute again, and the monkeys returned dancing. The grandmother contained
her laughter. Then they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> up over the kitchen; their <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> gave off a red light; they drew
away and scrubbed their noses and frightened each other with the faces they made.
And as the grandmother saw all of this, she burst into violent laughter; and they did not see
the faces [of the elder brothers] again because of the old woman's laughter.
"Only once more shall we <span class="t3 t11 t18 t27 hoverable">call</span> them, grandmother, so that they shall come for the fourth
time," said the boys. They began again, then, to play the flute, but [their brothers] did not
return the fourth time, instead they fled into the forest as quickly as they could.
The boys said to their grandmother: "We have done everything possible, dear grandmother;
they came once, then we tried to <span class="t3 t11 t18 t27 hoverable">call</span> them again. But do not grieve, here we are, your
grandchildren; you must look to us, oh, our mother! Oh, our grandmother! to remind you of
our elder brothers, those who were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> and have the names of Hunbatz and Hunchouén,"
said Hunahpú and Xbalanqué.
They were invoked by the musicians and singers, and by the old people. The painters and
craftsmen also invoked them in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">days</span> gone by. But they were changed into animals and
became monkeys because they became arrogant and abused their brothers.
In this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> they were disgraced; this was their loss, in this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> Hunbatz and Hunchouén were
overcome and became animals. They had always lived in their home; they were musicians and

singers and also did <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> when they lived with their grandmother and with their
mother.

Then they [Hunahpú] and [Xbalanqué] began to work, in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> to be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> of by their
grandmother and their mother. The first <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> they made was the cornfield. "We are going to
plant the cornfield, grandmother and mother," they said. "Do not grieve; here we are, your
grandchildren, we who shall <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> of our brothers," said Hunahpú and Xbalanqué.
At once they <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> their axes, their picks, and their wooden hoes and went, each carrying his
blowgun on his shoulder. As they <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> they asked their grandmother to <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> them
their midday meal.
"At midday, come and <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> our food, grandmother," they said.
"Very well, my grandsons," the old woman replied.
Soon they came to the field. And as they plunged the pick into the earth, it worked the earth; it
did the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> alone.
In the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> they put the ax in the trunks of the trees and in the branches, and instantly
they fell and all the trees and vines were lying on the ground. The trees fell quickly, with only
one stroke of the ax.
The pick also dug a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> deal. One could not count the thistles and brambles which had been
felled with one blow of the pick. Neither was it possible to tell what it had dug and broken up,
in all the large and small woods.
And having taught an animal, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Xmucur, they had it climb to the top of a large tree and
Hunahpú and Xbalanqué said to it: "Watch for our grandmother to come with our food, and as
soon as she comes, begin at once to sing, and we shall seize the pick and the ax."
"Very well," Xmucur answered.
And they began to shoot with their blowguns; certainly they did none of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> of clearing
and cultivating. A little later, the dove sang, and they ran quickly, grabbing the pick and ax.
And one of them covered his <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> and also deliberately covered his <span class="t13 t23 hoverable">hands</span> With <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> and in
the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> smeared his face to look like a real laborer, and the other purposely threw
splinters of wood over his <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> he really had been cutting the trees.
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> their grandmother saw them. They ate at once, but they had not really done the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> of
tilling the soil, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> deserving it they were given their midday meal. After a while,
they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> home.
"We are really tired, grandmother," they said <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> arriving, stretching their legs and arms
before her, but <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> reason.

They returned the following day, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> arriving at the field, they found that all the trees
and vines were standing again and that the brambles and thistles had become entangled again.
"Who has played this trick on us;" they said. "No doubt all the small and large animals did it,
the puma, the jaguar, the deer, the rabbit, the mountain-cat, the coyote, the wild boar, the
coati, the small birds, the large birds; they, it was, who did it; in a single night, they did it."
They began again to prepare the field and to prepare the soil and cut the trees. They talked
over what they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have to do with the trees which they had cut, and the weeds which they
had pulled up.
"Now we shall watch over our cornfield; perhaps we can surprise those who come to do all of
this damage," they said, talking it over together. And later they returned home.
"What do you think of it, grandmother? They have made fun of us. Our field, which we had
worked, has been turned into a field of stubble and a thick woods. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> we found it, when we
got there, a little while ago, grandmother," they said to her and to their mother. "But we shall
return there and watch over it, because it is not right that they do such <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> to us," they said.
Then they dressed and returned at once to their field of cut trees, and there they hid
themselves, stealthily, in the darkness.
Then all the animals gathered again; one of each kind came with the other small and large
animals. It was just midnight when they came, all talking as they came, saying in their own
language: "Rise up, trees! Rise up, vines!"
So they spoke when they came and gathered under the trees, under the vines, and they came
closer until they appeared before the <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> [of Hunahpú and Xbalanqué].
The puma and the jaguar were the first, and [Hunahpú and Xbalanqué] wanted to seize them,
but [the animals] did not let them. Then the deer and the rabbit came close. and the only parts
of them which they could seize were their tails, only these, they pulled out. The tall of the
deer remained in their hands, and for this <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> the deer and the rabbit have short tails.
Neither the mountain-cat, the coyote, the wild boar, nor the coati fell into their hands. All the
animals passed before Hunahpú and Xbalanqué, who were furious because they could not
catch them.
But, finally, another animal came hopping along, and this one which was the rat, [which] they
seized instantly, and wrapped him in a cloth. Then when they had caught him, they squeezed
his <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> and tried to choke him, and they burned his tall in the fire, and for that <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> the
rat's tail has no hair. So, too, the boys, Hunahpú and Xbalanqué, tried to poke at his eyes.
The rat said: "I must not die at your hands. And neither is it your business to plant the
cornfield."
"What are you telling us now?" the boys asked the rat.
"Loosen me a little, for I have something which I wish to tell you, and I shall tell you
immediately, but first give me something to eat," said the rat.

"We will give you <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> afterward, but first speak," they answered.
"Very well. Do you know, then, that the property of your parents Hun-Hunahpú and VucubHunahpú, as they were called, those who died in Xibalba, or rather the gear with which they
played ball, has remained and is hanging from the roof of the house: the ring, the gloves, and
the ball? Nevertheless, your grandmother does not want to show them to you for it was on
<span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> that your parents died."
"Are you sure of that?" said the boys to the rat. And they were very happy when they <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span>
about the rubber ball. And as the rat had now talked, they showed the rat what his <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span>
be.
"This shall be your food: corn, chili-seeds, beans, pataxte, cacao; all this belongs to you, and
should there be anything stored away or forgotten, it shall be yours also. <span class="t28 hoverable">Eat</span> it," Hunahpú and
Xbalanqué said to the rat.
"Wonderful, boys," he said; "but what shall I tell your grandmother if she sees me?"
"Do not worry, because we are here and shall know what to say to our grandmother. Let us
go! We shall go quickly to the comer of the house, go at once to where the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> hang; we
shall be looking at the garret of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> and paying attention to our food," they said to the
rat.
And having arranged it thus, during the night after talking together, Hunahpú and Xbalanqué
arrived at midday. When they arrived, they <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> the rat with them, but they did not show
it; one of them <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> directly into the house, and the other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> to the corner and there let the
rat climb up quickly.
Immediately they asked their grandmother for food. "Prepare our food, we wish a chilisauce, grandmother," they said. And at once the <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> was prepared for them and a plate of
broth was put before them.
But this was only to deceive their grandmother and their mother. And having dried up the

drink," they said to their grandmother.
"Good," she said and went. Then they began to eat, but they were not really hungry; it was
only a trick. They saw then by means of their plate of chile how the rat <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> rapidly toward
the ball which was suspended from the roof of the house. On seeing this in their chile-sauce,
they sent to the river a certain xan, an animal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> xan which is like a mosquito, to puncture
the <span class="t6 hoverable">side</span> of their grandmother's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> jar, and although she tried to stop the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> which ran
out, she could not close the hole made in the jar.
"What is the <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> with our grandmother? Our mouths are dry, with thirst, we are dying of
thirst," they said to their mother and they sent her out, Immediately the rat <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> to cut [the
cord which held] the ball and it fell from the garret of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> with the ring and the
gloves and the leather pads. The boys seized them and ran quickly to hide them on the road
which led to the ball-court.

After this they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> to the river to join their grandmother and their mother, who were busily
trying to stop the hole in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> jar. And arriving With their blowgun, they said when they
came to the river: "What are you doing? We got tired [of waiting] and we came," they said.
"Look at the hole in my jar which I cannot stop, said the grandmother. Instantly they stopped
it, and <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> they returned, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> walking before their grandmother.
And in this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> the ball was found.

The boys returned happily to the ball-court to play; they were playing alone a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> and
cleared the court where their parents had played.
And the Lords of Xibalba, hearing them, said: "Who are they who play again over our heads
and disturb us with the noise they make? Perchance Hun-Hunahpú and Vucub-Hunahpú did
not die, those who wished to exalt themselves before us? Go at once and <span class="t3 t11 t18 t27 hoverable">call</span> them!"
So said Hun-Camé, Vucub-Camé, and all the lords. And sending the messengers to <span class="t3 t11 t18 t27 hoverable">call</span> them,
they said to them: "Go and tell them when you get there: 'Let them come,' the lords have said;
we wish to play ball with them here, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> seven <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">days</span> we wish to play; tell them so when
you arrive," <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> said the lords. This was the command which they gave to the messengers.
And they came then by the wide road which the boys had made that led directly to their
house; by it the messengers arrived directly before [the boys'] grandmother. They were eating
when the messengers from Xibalba arrived.
"Tell them to come, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> fail, the lords commanded," said the messengers of Xibalba. And
the messengers of Xibalba indicated the day: "Within seven <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">days</span> they will await them," they
said to Xmucané.
"It is well, messengers; they will go," the old woman answered. And the messengers <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> out
on their return.
Then the old woman's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> was filled with anxiety. "Who shall I send to <span class="t3 t11 t18 t27 hoverable">call</span> my
grandchildren? Was it not in this same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> that the messengers of Xibalba came before, when
they came to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> the [boys'] parents?" said the grandmother, entering her house, alone and
grieving.
And immediately a louse fell into her lap. She seized it and put it in the palm of her hand, and
the louse wriggled and began to walk.
"My child, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> you like that I sent you away to <span class="t3 t11 t18 t27 hoverable">call</span> my grandchildren from the ball-court?"
she said to the louse. "'Messengers have come to your grandmother,' tell them; 'come <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span>
seven days, tell them to come, said the messengers of Xibalba; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> your grandmother told me
to say,'" <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> she told the louse.
At once the louse swaggered off. Sitting on the road was a boy <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Tamazul, or the toad.
"Where are you going?" the toad said to the louse.

"I am carrying a message in my stomach. I go to <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> the boys," said the louse to Tamazul.
"Very well, but I see that you do not go quickly," said the toad to the louse. "Do you not want
me to swallow you? You shall see how I run, and so we shall arrive quickly."
"Very well," the louse said to the toad. Immediately the toad swallowed him. And the toad
walked a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> time, but <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> hurrying. Soon he met a large snake, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Zaquicaz.
"Where are you going, young Tamazul?" said Zaquicaz to the toad.
"I go as a messenger; I carry a message in my stomach," said the toad to the snake.
See that you do not walk quickly. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Would</span> I not arrive sooner?" the snake said to the toad.
"Come here," he said. At once Zaquicaz swallowed the toad. And from then on this was the
<span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> of snakes, who still today swallow toads.
The snake <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> quickly and having met Vac, which is a very large bird, the hawk, [the latter]
instantly swallowed the snake. Shortly afterward it arrived at the ball-court. From that time,
this has been the <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> of hawks, who devour snakes in the fields.
And <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> arrival, the hawk perched <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the cornice of the ball-court where Hunahpú and
Xbalanqué were amusing themselves playing ball. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Upon</span> arriving, the hawk began to cry:
"Vac-có! Vac-có!" it said cawing. ["Here is the hawk! Here is the hawk!"]
"Who is screaming? <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">Bring</span> our blowguns!" the boys exclaimed. And shooting at the hawk,
they aimed a pellet at the pupil of the eye and [the hawk] spiraled to the ground. They ran to
seize it and asked: "What do you come to do here?" they asked the hawk.
"I <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> a message in my stomach. First cure my eye and afterward I shall tell you," the hawk
answered.
"Very well," they said, and taking a bit of the rubber of the ball with which they were playing,
they put it in the hawk's eye. Lotzquic they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> it, and instantly the hawk's eye was
perfectly healed.
"Speak, then," they said to the hawk. And immediately it vomited a large snake.
"Speak, thou," they said to the snake.
"Good," the [snake] said and vomited the toad.
"Where is the message that you bring?" they asked the toad.
"Herein my stomach is the message," answered the toad. And immediately he tried, but could
not vomit; his mouth only filled with spittle but he did not vomit. The boys wanted to hit him
then.
"You are a liar, "they said, kicking him in the rump, and the bone of the haunches gave way.
He tried again, but his mouth only filled with spittle. Then the boys opened the toad's mouth
and once open, they looked inside of it. The louse was stuck to the toad's teeth: it had stayed

in its mouth and had not been swallowed, but only pretended to be swallowed. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> the toad
was tricked, and the kind of <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> to give it is not known. It cannot run; and it became the <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span>
of the snakes.
"Speak," they said to the louse, and then it gave its message. "Your grandmother has said,
boys: 'Go <span class="t3 t11 t18 t27 hoverable">call</span> them; the messengers of Hun-Camé and Vucub-Camé have come to tell them to
go to Xibalba, saying: "They must come here <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> seven <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">days</span> to play ball with us, and they
must also <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> their playing gear, the ball, the rings, the gloves, the leather pads, in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> that
they may amuse themselves here," said the lords. They have really come,' said your
grandmother. That is why I have come. For truly your grandmother said this and she cries and
grieves, for this <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> I have come."
"Is it true?" the boys asked themselves when they <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> this. And running quickly they
arrived at their grandmother's side; they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> only to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> their leave of her.
"We are going, grandmother, we came only to say goodbye. But here will be the sign which
we shall leave of our fate: each of us shall plant a reed, in the middle of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> we shall
plant it; if it dries, this shall be the sign of our death. 'They are dead!' you shall say, if it begins
to dry up. But if it sprouts again: 'They are living!' you shall say, oh, our grandmother. And
you, mother, do not weep, for here we leave the sign of our fate," <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> they said.
And before going, Hunahpú planted one [reed] and Xbalanqué planted another; they planted
them in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> and not in the field, nor did they plant them in moist soil, but in dry soil; in
the middle of their house, they <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> them planted.

Then they went, each one carrying his blowgun, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> down in the direction of Xibalba.
They descended the steps quickly and passed between several streams and ravines. They
passed among some birds and these birds were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Molay.
They also passed over a river of corruption, and over a river of blood, where they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be
destroyed, so the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> of Xibalba thought; but they did not touch it with their feet, instead
they crossed it on their blowguns.
They <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> on from there, and came to a crossway of four roads. They knew very <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> which
were the roads to Xibalba; the black road, the white road, the red road, and the green road. So,
then, they sent an animal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Xan. It was to go to gather information which they wanted.
"Sting them, one by one; first sting the one seated in the first <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> and then sting all of them,
since this is the part you must play: to suck the blood of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> on the roads," they said to
the mosquito.
"Very well," answered the mosquito. And immediately it flew on to the dark road and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span>
directly toward the wooden <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> which were seated first and covered with ornaments. It stung
the first, but this one said nothing; then it stung the next one, it stung the second, who was
seated, but this one said nothing, either.

After that it stung the third; the <span class="t7 hoverable">third</span> of those seated was Hun-Camé. "Ah!" he exclaimed
when it stung him. "What is this, Hun-Camé? What is it that has stung you? Do you not know
who has stung you? "said the fourth one of the lords, who were seated.
"What is the matter, Vucub-Camé? What has stung you?" said the fifth.
"Ah! Ah!" then said Xiquiripat. And Vucub-Camé asked him, "What has stung you?" and
when they stung the sixth who was seated [he cried], "Ah!"
"What is this, Cuchumaquic?" asked Xiquiripat. "What is it that has stung you?" And the
seventh one seated said "Ah" when he was stung.
"What is the matter, Ahalpuh?" said Cuchumaquic. "What has stung you?" And when it stung
him, the eighth of those seated said, "Ah!"
"What is the matter, Ahalcaná?" said Ahalpuh. "What has stung you?" And when he was
stung the ninth of those seated said "Ah!"
"What is this, Chamiabac? "said Ahalcaná. "What has stung you?" And when the tenth of
those seated was stung, he said "Ah!"
"What is the matter, Chamiaholom?" said Chamiabac. "What has stung you?" And when the
eleventh of those seated was stung he said, "Ah!"
"What happened?" said Chamiaholom. "What has stung you?" And when the twelfth of those
seated was stung, he said "Alas!"
"What is this, Patán?" they said. "What has stung you?" And the thirteenth of those seated
said "Alas!" when he was stung.
"What is the matter, Quicxic?" said Patán. "What has stung you?" And the fourteenth of those
seated when he was stung said "Alas!"
"What has stung you, Quicrixcac?" said Quicré.
In this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> they told their names, as they all said them one to the other. So they made
themselves known by telling their names, calling each chief, one by one. And in this manner
each of those seated in his comer told his name.
Not a single one of the names was missed. All told their names when Hunahpú puffed out a
hair of his leg, which was what had stung them. It was really not a mosquito which stung
them which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> for Hunahpú and Xbalanqué to hear the names of all of them.
They [the youths] continued on their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> and arrived where the Lords of Xibalba were.
"Greet the lord, the one who is seated,' said one in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> to deceive them.
"That is not a lord. it is nothing more than a wooden figure," they said, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> on.
Immediately they began to greet them:

"Hail, Hun-Camé! Hail, Vucub-Camé! Hail, Xiquiripat! Hail, Cuchumaquic! Hail, Ahalpuh!
Hail, Ahalcaná! Hail, Chamiabac! Hail, Chamiaholom! Hail, Quicxic! Hail, Patán! Hail,
Quicré! Hail, Quicrixcac!" they said coming before them. And looking in their faces, they
spoke the name of all, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> missing the name of a single one of them.
But what the lords wished was that they should not discover their names.
"Sit here," they said, hoping that they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> sit in the seat [which they indicated].
"That is not a seat for us; it is only a hot stone," said Hunahpú and Xbalanqué, and they [the
Lords of Xibalba] could not overcome them.
"Very well, go to that house," the lords said. And they [the youths] <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> on and entered the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">House</span> of Gloom. And neither there were they overcome.

II. <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">Chapter</span> 9
This was the first test of Xibalba. The Lords of Xibalba <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> that [the boys'] entrance there
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be the beginning of their downfall. After a while [the boys] entered the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">House</span> of
Gloom; immediately lighted sticks of fat pine were given them and the messengers of HunCamé also <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> a cigar to each one.
"'These are their pine sticks,' said the lord; 'they must return them at dawn, tomorrow, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span>
with the cigars, and you must <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> them back whole,' said the lord." So said the messengers
when they arrived.
"Very well," [the boys] replied. But they really did not [light] the sticks of pine, instead they
put a red-colored <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> of them, or some feathers from the tail of the macaw, which to
the night watches looked like lighted pine sticks. And as for the cigars, they attached fireflies
to their end.
All night [everybody] <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> they were defeated. "They are lost," said the night watchmen.
But the pine sticks had not been burned and looked the same, and the cigars had not been
lighted and looked the same as before.
They <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> to tell the lords.
"How is this? Whence have they come? Who conceived them? Who gave birth to them? This
really troubles us, because it is not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> what they do. Their faces are strange, and strange is
their conduct." they said to each other.
Soon all the lords summoned [the boys].
"Eh! Let us play ball, boys!" they said. At the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> they were questioned by Hun-Camé
and Vucub-Camé:
"Where did you come from? Tell us, boys!" said the Lords of Xibalba.
"Who knows whence we came! We do not know," they said, and nothing more.

"Very well. Let us play ball, boys," said the Lords of Xibalba.
"Good," they replied.
"We shall <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> our ball," said the Lords of Xibalba.
"By no means, shall you <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> [your ball], but ours," the boys answered.
"Not that one, but ours we shall use," insisted the Lords of Xibalba.
"Very well," said the boys.
"Let us play for a worm, the chil," said the Lords of Xibalba.
"No, but instead, the <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> of the puma shall speak," said the boys.
"Not that," said those of Xibalba.
"Very well," said Hunahpú.
Then the Lords of Xibalba seized the ball; they threw it directly at the ring of Hunahpú.
Immediately, while those of Xibalba grasped the handle of the knife of flint, the ball
rebounded and bounced all around the floor of the ball-court.
"What is this?" exclaimed Hunahpú and Xbalanqué. "You wish to kill us? Perchance you did
not send to <span class="t3 t11 t18 t27 hoverable">call</span> us? And your own messengers did not come? In truth, unfortunate are we! We
shall leave at once," the boys said to them.
This was exactly what those of Xibalba wanted to have happen to the boys, that they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span>
die immediately, right there in the ball-court and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be overcome. But it did not
happen thus, and it was the Lords of Xibalba who were defeated by the boys.
"Do not leave, boys, let us go on playing ball, but we shall <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> your ball," they said to the
boys.
"Very well," the boys answered and then they drove their ball through [the ring of Xibalba],
and with this the game ended.
And offended by their defeat, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> of Xibalba immediately said: "What shall we do in
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> to overcome them?" And turning to the boys they said to them: "Go gather and <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> us,
early tomorrow morning, four gourds of flowers." So said the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> of Xibalba to the boys.
"Very well. And what kind of flowers?" they asked the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> of Xibalba.
"A branch of red chiptlín, a branch of white chiptlín, a branch of yellow chiptlín, and a branch
of carinimac," said the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> of Xibalba.
"Very well," replied the boys.

Thus the talk ended; equally strong and vigorous were the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> of the boys. And their hearts
were calm when they gave themselves up to be overcome.
The Lords of Xibalba were happy, thinking that they had already defeated them.
"This has turned out <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> for us. First they must cut them [the flowers]," said the Lords of
Xibalba. "Where shall they go to get the flowers?" they said to themselves.
"Surely you will give us our flowers tomorrow early; go, then, to cut them," the Lords of
Xibalba said to Hunahpú and Xbalanqué.
"Very well," they replied. "At dawn we shall play ball again," they said <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> leaving.
And immediately the boys entered the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">House</span> of Knives, the <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> of torture in
Xibalba. And what the lords wanted was that they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be cut to pieces by the knives, and
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be quickly killed; that is what they Wished in their hearts.
But the [boys] did not die. They spoke at once to the knives and said to them:
"Yours shall be the <span class="t21 hoverable">flesh</span> of all the animals," they said to the knives. And they did not move
again, but all the knives were quiet.
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> they passed the night in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">House</span> of Knives, and calling all the ants, they said to them:
"Come, Cutting Ants, come, zompopos, and all of you go at once, go and <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> all the kinds of
flowers that we must cut for the lords."
"Very well," they said, and all the ants <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> to <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> the flowers from the gardens of HunCamé and Vucub-Camé.
Previously [the lords] had warned the guards of the flowers of Xibalba: "Take care of our
flowers, do not let them be <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> by the boys who shall come to cut them. But how could [the
boys] see and cut the flowers? Not at all. Watch, then, all night!"
"Very well," they answered. But the guards of the garden <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> nothing. Needlessly they
shouted up into the branches of the trees in the garden. There they were all night, repeating
their same shouts and songs.
"Ixpurpuvec! Ixpurpuvec!" one shouted.
"Puhuyú! Puhuyú!" the other answered.
Puhuyú was the name of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> who watched the garden of Hun-Camé and Vucub-Camé.
But they did not notice the ants who were robbing them of what they were guarding, turning
around and moving here and there, cutting the flowers, climbing the trees to cut the flowers,
and gathering them from the ground at the foot of the trees.
Meanwhile the guards <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> on crying, and they did not feel the teeth which were cutting their
tails and their wings.

And <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> the ants carried, between their teeth, the flowers which they <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> down, and
gathering them from the ground, they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> on carrying them with their teeth.
Quickly they filled the four gourds with flowers, which were moist [with dew] when it
dawned. Immediately the messengers arrived to get them. "'Tell them to come,' the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">lord</span> has
said, 'and <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> here instantly what they have cut,'" they said to the boys.
"Very well," the [boys] answered. And carrying the flowers in the four gourds, they went, and
when they arrived before the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">lord</span> [of Xibalba] and the other lords, it was lovely to see the
flowers they had brought. And in this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> the Lords of Xibalba were overcome.
The boys had only sent the ants [to cut the flowers], and in a night the ants cut them and put
them in the gourds.
Instantly the Lords of Xibalba paled and their faces became livid because of the flowers. They
sent at once for the guardians of the flowers. "Why did you permit them to steal our flowers?
These which we see here are our flowers," they said to the guardians.
"We noticed nothing, my lord. Our tails also suffered," they answered. And then the [lords]
tore at their mouths as a punishment for having let that which was under their care be stolen.
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> were Hun-Camé and Vucub-Camé defeated by Hunahpú and Xbalanqué. And this was
the beginning of their deeds. From that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> the mouth of the owl is divided, cleft as it is
today.
Immediately they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> down to play ball, and also they played several tie-matches. Then they
finished playing and agreed to play again the following <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> at dawn. So said the Lords of
Xibalba.
"It is well," said the boys <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> finishing.

Afterward they entered the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">House</span> of Cold. It is impossible to describe how cold it was. The
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> was <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span> of hail; it was the mansion of cold. Soon, however, the cold was ended because
with [a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> of] old logs the boys made the cold disappear.
That is why they did not die; they were still alive when it dawned. Surely what the Lords of
Xibalba wanted was that they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> die; but it was not thus, and when it dawned, they were
still <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span> of health, and they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> out again, when the messengers came to get them.
"How is this? They are not dead yet?" said the Lords of Xibalba. They were amazed to see the
deeds of Hunahpú and Xbalanqué.
Presently the boys [entered] the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">House</span> of Jaguars. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> was <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span> of jaguars. "Do not bite
us! Here is what belongs to you," [the boys] said to the jaguars. And quickly they threw some
bones to the animals, which pounced <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the bones.

"Now surely they are finished. Now already they have eaten their own entrails. At last they
have given themselves up. Now their bones have been broken, "so said the guards, all happy
because of this.
But they [the boys] did not die. As usual, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> and healthy, they came out of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">House</span> of
Jaguars.
"What kind of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> are they? Where did they come from?" said all the Lords of Xibalba.
Presently they [the boys] entered into the midst of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">House</span> of Fire, inside which there
was only fire; but they were not burned. Only the coals and the wood burned. And, as usual,
they were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> when it dawned. But what they [the Lords of Xibalba] wished was that [the
boys] <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> die rapidly, where they had been. Nevertheless, it did not happen thus, which
disheartened the Lords of Xibalba.
Then they put them into the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">House</span> of Bats. There was nothing but bats inside this house, the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> of Camazotz, a large animal, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> weapons for killing were like a dry point, and
instantly those who came into their presence perished.
They [the boys] were in there, then, but they slept inside their blowguns. And they were not
bitten by those who were in the house. Nevertheless, one of them had to give up because of
another Camazotz that came from the sky, and made him come into sight.
The bats were assembled in council all night, and flew about: "Quilitz, quilitz," they said: So
they were saying all night. They stopped for a little while, however, and they did not move
and were pressed against the end of one of the blowguns.
Then Xbalanqué said to Hunahpú: "Look you, has it begun already to get light?"
"Maybe so. I am going to see," [Hunahpú] answered.
And as he wished very much to look out of the mouth of the blowgun, and wished to see if it
had dawned, instantly Camazotz cut off his <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> of Hunahpú was decapitated.
Xbalanqué asked again: "Has it not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> dawned?" But Hunahpú did not move. "Where have
you gone, Hunahpú? What have you done?" But he did not move, and remained silent.
Then Xbalanqué felt concerned and exclaimed: "Unfortunate are we. We are completely
undone."
They <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> immediately to hang the <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> [of Hunahpú] in the ball-court by special <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> of
Hun-Camé and Vucub-Camé, and all the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> of Xibalba rejoiced for what had happened to
the <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> of Hunahpú.

Immediately he [Xbalanqué] <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> all the animals, the coati, the wild boar, all the animals
small and large, during the night, and at dawn he asked them what their <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> was.

"What does each of you eat? For I have <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> you so that you may choose your food," said
Xbalanqué to them.
"Very well," they answered. And immediately each <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> his [own food] and they all

stones. Others <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> to gather earth. Varied was the <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> of the [small] animals and of the
large animals.
Behind them the turtle was lingering, it came waddling along to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> its food. And reaching at
the end [of Hunahpú's body] it assumed the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of the <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> of Hunahpú, and instantly the
<span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> were fashioned.
Many soothsayers came, then, from heaven. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Heart</span> of Heaven, Huracán, came to soar over
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">House</span> of Bats.
It was not easy to finish making the face, but it turned out very well; the hair had a handsome
appearance and [the head] could also speak.
But as it was about to dawn and the horizon reddened: "Make it dark again, old one!" the
buzzard was told.
"Very well, said the old one, and instantly the old one darkened [the sky]. "Now the buzzard
has darkened it," the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> say nowadays.
And so, during the cool of dawn, the [Hunahpú] began his existence.
"Will it be good?" they said. "Will it turn out to look like Hunahpú?"
"It is very good," they answered. And really it seemed that the skull had changed itself back
into a real head.
Then they [the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> boys] talked among themselves and agreed: "Do not play ball; only
pretend to play; I shall do everything alone," said Xbalanqué.
At once he gave his orders to a rabbit: "Go and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> your <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> over the ball-court; stay there
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the oak grove," the rabbit was told by Xbalanqué; "when the ball comes to you, run out
immediately, and I shall do the rest," the rabbit was told, when they gave him these
instructions during the night.
Presently <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> broke and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> boys were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> and healthy. Then they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> down to play
ball. The <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> of Hunahpú was suspended over the ball-court.
"We have triumphed! [said the Lords of Xibalba].You worked your own destruction, you
have delivered yourselves," they said. In this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> they annoyed Hunahpú.
"Hit his <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> with the ball," they said. But they did not bother him with it; he paid no
attention to it.

Then the Lords of Xibalba threw out the ball. Xbalanqué <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> out to get it; the ball was going
straight to the ring, but it stopped, bounced, and passed quickly over the ball-court and with a
jump <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> toward the oak grove.
Instantly the rabbit ran out and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> hopping; and the Lords of Xibalba ran after it. They
went, making noise and shouting after the rabbit. It ended by all of the Lords of Xibalba
going.
At once Xbalanqué <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> possession of the <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> of Hunahpú; and taking the turtle he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> to
suspend it over the ball-court. And that <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> was actually the <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> of Hunahpú and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span>
boys were very happy.
Those of Xibalba ran, then, to <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> the ball and having found it between the oaks, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> them,
saying:
"Come here. Here is the ball. We found it," they said, and they <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> it.
When the Lords of Xibalba returned, they exclaimed, "What is this we see?"
Then they began to play again. Both of them tied.
Presently Xbalanqué threw a stone at the turtle, which came to the ground and fell in the ballcourt, breaking into a <span class="t15 t23 hoverable">thousand</span> pieces like seeds, before the lords.
"Who of you shall go to <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> it? Where is the one who shall go to <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> it?" said the Lords of
Xibalba.
And so were the Lords of Xibalba overcome by Hunahpú and Xbalanqué. These <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> suffered

Here is the <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">death</span> of Hunahpú and Xbalanqué.

they died.
Having been forewarned of all the suffering which the [Lords of Xibalba] wished to impose

fierce animals which were in Xibalba.
Afterward they sent for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> soothsayers who were like prophets; they were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Xulú and

you say then, Xulú and Pacam? If they ask you: 'Will it not be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> to throw their bones into

If
you were asked all the above by them, you should answer: 'It <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> if they were to

practice," said Hunahpú and Xbalanqué. And when they [the boys] <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> leave of them, they
already knew about their approaching death.
They made then, a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> bonfire, a kind of oven; the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> of Xibalba made it and filled it with
thick branches.
Shortly afterward the messengers arrived who had to accompany [the boys], the messengers
of Hun-Camé and Vucub-Camé.
"'Tell them to come. Go and get the boys; go there so that they may know we are going to
burn them.' This the lords said, oh, boys!" the messengers exclaimed.
"It is well," they answered. And setting out quickly, they arrived near the bonfire. There [the
Lords of Xibalba] wanted to force the boys to play a mocking game with them.
"Let us drink our chicha and fly four times, each one [over the bonfire] boys!" was said to
them by Hun-Camé.
"Do not try to deceive us,"[the boys] answered. "Perchance, we do not know about our death,
oh lords! And that this is what awaits us here? "And embracing each other, face to face, they
both stretched out their arms, bent toward the ground and jumped into the bonfire, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span>
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> died together.
All those of Xibalba were filled with joy, shouting and whistling they exclaimed: "Now we
have overcome them. At last they have given themselves up."
Immediately they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Xulú and Pacam, to whom they [the boys] had given their
instructions, and asked them what they must do with their bones, as they [the boys] had
foretold. Those of Xibalba then ground their bones and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> to cast them into the river. But
the bones did not go very far, for settling themselves down at once on the bottom of the river,
they were changed back into handsome boys. And when again they showed themselves they
really had their same old faces.

II. <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">Chapter</span> 13
On the fifth <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> they appeared again and were seen in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> by the people. Both had the
appearance of fishmen; when those of Xibalba saw them, after having hunted them all over
the river.
And the following day, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> poor <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> presented themselves with very old-looking faces and
of miserable appearance, [and] ragged clothes, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> countenances did not commend them.
So they were seen by all those of Xibalba.
And what they did was very little. They only performed the dance of the puhuy [owl or chumowl], the dance of the cux [weasel], and the dance of the iboy [armadillo], and they also
danced the xtzul [centipede] and the chitic [that walks on stilts].
Furthermore, they worked many miracles. They burned houses as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> they really were
burning and instantly they were as they had been before. Many of those of Xibalba watched
them in wonder.
Presently they cut themselves into bits; they killed each other; the first one whom they had
killed stretched out as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> he were dead, and instantly the other <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> him back to life.
Those of Xibalba looked on in amazement at all they did, and they performed it, as the
beginning of their triumph over those of Xibalba.
Presently <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> of their dances came to the ears of the lords Hun-Camé and Vucub-Camé.
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Upon</span> hearing it they exclaimed: "Who are these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> orphans? Do they really give you so
much pleasure?"
"Surely their dances are very beautiful, and all that they do," answered he who had <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span>
the news to the lords.
Happy to hear this, the [lords] then sent their messengers to <span class="t3 t11 t18 t27 hoverable">call</span> [the boys] with flattery. "'Tell
them to come here, tell them to come so that we may see what they do; that we may admire
them and regard them with wonder,' this the lords said. 'So you shall say <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">unto</span> them,'" this was
told to the messengers.
They arrived at once before the dancers and gave them the message of the lords.
"We do not wish to, the [boys] answered," because, frankly, we are ashamed. How could we
not but be ashamed to appear in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> of the lords with our ugly countenances, our <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span>
which are so big, and our poor appearance? Do you not see that we are nothing more than
some [poor] dancers? What shall we tell our companions in poverty who have come with us
and wish to see our dances and be entertained by them? How could we do our dances before
the lords? For that reason, then, we do not want to go, oh, messengers," said Hunahpú and
Xbalanqué.
Finally, with downcast faces and with reluctance and sorrow they went; but for a while they
did not wish to walk, and the messengers had to beat them in the face many times, when they
led them to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> of the lords.

They arrived, then, before the lords, timid and with <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> bowed; they came prostrating
themselves, making reverences and humiliating themselves. They looked feeble, ragged, and
their appearance was really that of vagabonds when they arrived they were questioned
immediately about their country and their people; they also asked them about their mother and
their father.
"Where do you come from?" [the lords] said.
"We do not know, Sir. We do not know the faces of our mother and father; we were small
when they died," they answered, and did not say another word.
"All right. Now do [your dances] so that we may admire you. What do you want? We shall
give you pay," they told them.
"We do not want anything; but really we are very much afraid," they said to the lord.
"Do not grieve, do not be afraid. Dance! And do first the part in which you kill yourselves;
burn my house, do all that you know how to do. We shall marvel at you, for that is what our
hearts desire. And afterwards, poor things, we shall give help for your journey," they told
them.
Then they began to sing and dance. All the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> of Xibalba arrived and gathered <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> in
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> to see them. Then they performed the dance of the cux, they danced the puhuy, and they
danced the iboy.
And the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">lord</span> said to them: "Cut my dog into pieces and let him be <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> back to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> by
you," he said to them.
"Very well," they answered, and cut the dog into bits. Instantly they <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> him back to life.
The dog was truly <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span> of joy when he was <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> back to life, and wagged his tail when they
revived him.
The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> said to them then: "Burn my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> now!" <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> he said to them. instantly they put
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> to the lord's house, and although all the lords were assembled <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the house,
they were not burned. Quickly it was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> again, and not for one instant was the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> of
Hun-Camé destroyed.
All of the lords were amazed, and in the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> the [boys'] dances gave them much
pleasure.
Then they were told by the lord: "Now kill a man, <span class="t2 t9 t10 t16 t18 t19 t27 t28 hoverable">sacrifice</span> him, but do not let him die," he
told them.
"Very well," they answered. And seizing a man, they quickly sacrificed him, and raising his
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> on high, they held it so that all the lords could see it.
Again Hun-Camé and Vucub-Camé were amazed. A moment afterward the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> was <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span>
back to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> by them [the boys], and his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> was filled with joy when he was revived.

The lords were astounded. "Sacrifice yourselves now, let us see it! We really like your
dances!" said the lords. "Very well, Sirs," they answered. And they proceeded to <span class="t2 t9 t10 t16 t18 t19 t27 t28 hoverable">sacrifice</span>
each other. Hunahpú was sacrificed by Xbalanqué; one by one his arms and his legs were
sliced off, his <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> was cut from his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> and carried away; his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> was torn from his breast
and thrown onto the grass. All the Lords of Xibalba were fascinated. They looked on in
wonder, but really it was only the dance of one man; it was Xbalanqué.
"Get up!" he said, and instantly [Hunahpú] returned to life. They [the boys] were very happy
and the lords were also happy. In truth, what they did gladdened the hearts of Hun-Camé and
Vucub-Camé, and the latter felt as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> they themselves were dancing.
Then their hearts were filled with <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> and longing by the dances of Hunahpú and
Xbalanqué; and Hun-Camé and Vucub-Camé gave their commands.
"Do the same with us! <span class="t2 t9 t10 t16 t18 t19 t27 t28 hoverable">Sacrifice</span> us!" they said. "Cut us into pieces, one by one!" Hun-Camé
and Vucub-Camé said to Hunahpú and Xbalanqué.
"Very well; afterward you will come back to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> again. Perchance, did you not <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> us here
in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> that we should entertain you, the lords, and your sons, and vassals?" they said to the
lords.
And so it happened that they first sacrificed the one, who was the chief and [Lord of Xibalba],
the one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Hun-Camé, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> of Xibalba.
And when Hun-Camé was dead, they overpowered Vucub-Camé, and they did not <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span>
either of them back to life.
The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> of Xibalba fled as soon as they saw that their lords were dead and sacrificed. In an
instant both were sacrificed. And this they [the boys] did in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> to chastize them. Quickly
the principal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">lord</span> was killed. And they did not <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> him back to life.
And another <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">lord</span> humbled himself then, and presented himself before the dancers. They had
not discovered him, nor had they found him. "Have mercy on me!" he said when they found
him.
All the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t13 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">sons</span> and vassals of Xibalba fled to a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> ravine, and all of them were crowded into
this narrow, deep place. There they were crowded <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> and hordes of ants came and found
them and dislodged them from the ravine. In this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> [the ants] drove them to the road, and
when they arrived [the people] prostrated themselves and gave themselves up; they humbled
themselves and arrived, grieving.
In this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> the Lords of Xibalba were overcome. Only by a miracle and by their [own]
transformation could [the boys] have done it.

II. <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">Chapter</span> 14
Immediately [the boys] told their names and they extolled themselves before all the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> of
Xibalba.
"Hear our names. We shall also tell you the names of our fathers. We are Hunahpú and
Xbalanqué; those are our names. And our fathers are those whom you killed and who were
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Hun-Hunahpú and Vucub-Hunahpú. We, those whom you see here, are, then, the
avengers of the torments and suffering of our fathers. That is the <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> why we resent all the

not one of you shall escape, "they said.
Instantly all the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> of Xibalba fell to their knees, crying.
"Have mercy on us, Hunahpú and Xbalanqué! It is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> that we sinned against your fathers as

"Very well. This is our sentence, that we are going to tell you. Hear it, all you of Xibalba:

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> they spoke to all the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> of Xibalba.
In this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> their destruction and their lamentations began. Their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> in the olden <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">days</span> was
not much. They only liked to do <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> in those times. In truth, in those days, they did
not have the category of gods. Furthermore, their horrible faces frightened people. They were
the enemies, the owls. They incited to evil, to <span class="t0 t9 t11 t14 t17 t28 hoverable">sin</span> and to discord.
They were also false in their hearts, black and white at the same time, envious and tyrannical,
according to what was said of them. Furthermore, they painted and greased their faces.
In this way, then, occurred the loss of their grandeur and the decadence of their empire.
And this was what Hunahpú and Xbalanqué did.
Meanwhile, the grandmother was crying and lamenting before the reeds which they had <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span>
planted. The reeds sprouted, then they dried up when [the boys] were consumed in the
bonfire; afterward [the reeds] sprouted again. Then the grandmother lighted the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> and
burned incense before the reeds in memory of her grandchildren. And the grandmother's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span>
filled with joy when, for the <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> time, the reeds sprouted. Then they were worshiped by
the grandmother, and she <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> them the Center of the House, Nicah [the center] they were
called.

"Green reeds growing in the plains" [Cazam Ah Chatam Uleu] was their name. And they were
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the Center of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">House</span> and the Center, because in the middle of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> they planted
the reeds. And the reeds, which were planted, were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the plains, Green Reeds growing on
the plains. They also were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Green Reeds because they had resprouted. This name was
given them by Xmucané [given] to those [reeds] which Hunahpú and Xbalanqué <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> planted
in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> that they should be remembered by their grandmother.
Well, now, their fathers, those who died <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> ago, were Hun-Hunahpú and Vucub-Hunahpú.
They also saw the faces of their fathers there in Xibalba and their fathers talked with their
descendants, that is the ones who overthrew those of Xibalba.
And here is how their fathers were honored by them. They honored Vucub-Hunahpú; they
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> to honor him at the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> of <span class="t2 t9 t10 t16 t18 t19 t27 t28 hoverable">sacrifice</span> of the ball-court. And at the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> they wanted
to make Vucub-Hunahpú's face. They hunted there for his entire body, his mouth, his nose,
his eyes. They found his body, but it could do very little. It could not pronounce his name, this
Hunahpú. Neither could his mouth say it.
And here is how they extolled the memory of their fathers, whom they had <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> there in the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> of <span class="t2 t9 t10 t16 t18 t19 t27 t28 hoverable">sacrifice</span> at the ball-court: "You shall be invoked," their <span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t13 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">sons</span> said to them, when they
fortified their heart. "You shall be the first to arise, and you shall be the first to be worshiped
by the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t13 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">sons</span> of the noblemen, by the civilized vassals. Your names shall not be lost. So it shall
be!" they told their fathers and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> consoled themselves. "We are the avengers of your death,
of the pains and sorrows which they caused you."
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> was their leave-taking, when they had already overcome all the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> of Xibalba.
Then they rose up in the midst of the light, and instantly they were lifted into the sky. One
was given the sun, the other, the moon. Then the arch of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heaven</span> and the face of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> were
lighted. And they dwelt in heaven.
Then the four hundred boys whom Zipacná had killed also ascended, and so they again
became the companions of [the boys] and were changed into stars in the sky.

Here, then is the beginning of when it was decided to make man, and when what must enter

And the Forefathers, the Creators and Makers, who were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Tepeu and Gucumatz said:

It was just before the sun, the moon, and the stars appeared over the Creators and Makers.

From Paxil, from Cayalá, as they were called, came the yellow ears of corn and the white ears
of corn.
These are the names of the animals which <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> the food: yac (the mountain cat), utiú (the

they showed them the road to Paxil.
And <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> they found the food, and this was what <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> into the <span class="t21 hoverable">flesh</span> of <span class="t16 hoverable">created</span> man, the made

formation of man] by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> of the Forefathers.
And in this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> they were filled with joy, because they had found a beautiful land, <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span> of
pleasures, abundant in ears of yellow corn and ears of white corn, and abundant also in
pataxte and cacao, and in innumerable zapotes, anonas, jocotes, nantzes, matasanos, and
honey. There was an abundance of delicious <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> in those villages <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Paxil and Cayalá.
There were foods of every kind, small and large foods, small plants and large plants.
The animals showed them the road. And then grinding the yellow corn and the white corn,
Xmucané made nine drinks, and from this <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> came the strength and the flesh, and with it
they <span class="t16 hoverable">created</span> the muscles and the strength of man. This the Forefathers did, Tepeu and
Gucumatz, as they were called.
After that they began to talk about the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span> and the making of our first mother and father;
of yellow corn and of white corn they made their flesh; of corn-meal dough they made the
arms and the legs of man. Only dough of corn meal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> into the <span class="t21 hoverable">flesh</span> of our first fathers, the
four men, who were created.

THESE ARE THE NAMES OF THE FIRST <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> who were <span class="t16 hoverable">created</span> and formed: the first <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span>
was Balam-Quitzé, the second, Balam-Acab, the third, Mahucutah, and the fourth was IquiBalam.
These are the names of our first mothers and fathers.
It is said that they only were made and formed, they had no mother, they had no father. They
were only <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> men. They were not <span class="t16 t24 hoverable">born</span> of woman, nor were they begotten by the Creator
nor by the Maker, nor by the Forefathers. Only by a miracle, by means of incantation were
they <span class="t16 hoverable">created</span> and made by the Creator, the Maker, the Forefathers, Tepeu and Gucumatz. And
as they had the appearance of men, they were men; they talked, conversed, saw and heard,
walked, grasped things; they were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> and handsome men, and their figure was the figure of
a man.
They were endowed with intelligence; they saw and instantly they could see far, they
succeeded in seeing, they succeeded in knowing all that there is in the world. When they
looked, instantly they saw all around them, and they contemplated in turn the arch of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heaven</span>
and the round face of the earth.

The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> hidden [in the distance] they saw all, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> first having to move; at once they
saw the world, and so, too, from where they were, they saw it.
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Great</span> was their wisdom; their sight reached to the forests, the rocks, the lakes, the seas, the
mountains, and the valleys. In truth, they were admirable men. Balam-Quitzé, Balam-Acab,
Mahucutah, and Iqui-Balam.
Then the Creator and the Maker asked them: "What do you think of your condition? Do you
not see? Do you not hear? Are not your speech and manner of walking good? Look, then!
Contemplate the world, look [and see] if the mountains and the valleys appear! Try, then, to
see!" they said to [the four first men].
And immediately they [the four first men] began to see all that was in the world. Then they
gave thanks to the Creator and the Maker: "We really give you thanks, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> times!
We have been created, we have been given a mouth and a face, we speak, we hear, we think,
and walk; we feel perfectly, and we know what is far and what is near. We also see the large
and the small in the sky and on earth. We give you thanks, then, for having <span class="t16 hoverable">created</span> us, oh,
Creator and Maker! for having given us being, oh, our grandmother! oh, our grandfather!"
they said, giving thanks for their <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span> and formation.
They were able to know all, and they examined the four comers, the four points of the arch of
the sky and the round face of the earth.
But the Creator and the Maker did not hear this with pleasure. "It is not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> what our

Forefathers held counsel again. "What shall we do with them now? Let their sight reach only
to that which is near; let them see only a little of the face of the earth! It is not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> what they
say. Perchance, are they not by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> simple creatures of our making? Must they also be
gods? And if they do not reproduce and multiply when it will dawn, when the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> rises? And
what if they do not multiply?" So they spoke.
"Let us check a little their desires, because it is not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> what we see. Must they perchance be
the equals of ourselves, their Makers, who can, see afar, who know all and see all?"

Then the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Heart</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Heaven</span> blew mist into their eyes, which clouded their sight as. when a

only that was clear to them.
In this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> the <span class="t12 t20 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">wisdom</span> and all the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of the four men, the origin and beginning [of

Then their wives had being, and their women were made. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> himself made them carefully.
And so, during sleep, they came, truly beautiful, their women, at the <span class="t6 hoverable">side</span> of Balam-Quitzé,
Balam-Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui-Balam.
There were their women when they awakened, and instantly their hearts were filled with joy
because of their wives.
Here are the names of their wives: Cahá-Paluna was the name of the wife of Balam-Quitzé;
Chomihá was the wife of Balam-Acab; Tzununihá, the wife of Mahucutah; and Caquixahá
was the name of the wife of Iqui-Balam. These are the names of their wives, who were
distinguished women.
They conceived the men, of the small tribes and of the large tribes, and were the origin of us;
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> of Quiché.
There were many priests and sacrificers; there were not only four, but those four were the
Forefathers of us, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> of the Quiché.
The names of each one were different when they multiplied there in the East, and there were
many names of the people: Tepeu, Olomán, Cohah, Quenech, Ahau, as they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> those <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span>
there in the East, where they multiplied.
The beginning is known, too, of those of Tamub and those of Ilocab who came <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> from

Balam-Quitzé was the grandfather and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">father</span> of the nine <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> houses of the Cavec;
Balam-Acab was the grandfather and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">father</span> of the nine <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> houses of the Nimhaib;

father, those who propagated and multiplied there in the East.
The Tamub and Ilocab also came, and thirteen branches of peoples, the thirteen of Tecpán,
and those of Rabinal, the Cakchiquel, those from Tziquinahá, and the Zacahá and the Lamaq,
Cumatz, Tuhalhá, Uchabahá, those of Chumilahá, those of Quibahá, of Batenabá, Acul-Vinac,
Balamihá, the Canchahel, and Balam-Colob.
These are only the principal tribes, the branches of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> which we mention; only of the
principal ones shall we speak. Many others came from each group of the people, but we shall
not write their names. They also multiplied there in the East.
Many <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> were made and in the darkness they multiplied.

walked there in the East.
Nevertheless, they did not sustain nor maintain [their God]; they only raised their faces to the
sky, and they did not know why they had come so far as they did.

There they were then, in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> number, the black <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> and the white men, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> of many

There are generations in the world, there are country people, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> faces we do not see, who

The speech of all was the same. They did not invoke wood nor stone, and they remembered

Balam-Quitzé, Balam-Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui-Balam said, "Let us await the break of
day." So said those <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> <span class="t8 t12 t17 hoverable">wise</span> men, the enlightened men, the priests and sacrificers. This they
said.
Our first mothers and fathers did not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> have wood nor stones to keep; but their hearts were
tired of waiting for the sun. Already all the tribes and the Yaqui people, the priests and
sacrificers, were very many.
"Let us go, let us go to search and see if our [tribal] symbols are in safety; if we can <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> what
we must burn before them. For being as we are, there is no one who watches for us," said
Balam-Quitzé, Balam-Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui-Balam.
And having <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> of a city, they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> there.

This
was the name of the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">city</span> where they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> to receive their gods.

So, then, all arrived at Tulán. It was impossible to count the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> who arrived; there were very
many and they walked in an orderly way.
Then was the appearance of their gods; first those of Balam-Quitzé, Balam-Acab, Mahucutah,
and Iqui-Balam who were filled with joy: "At last we have found that for which we
searched!" they said.
And the first that appeared was Tohil, as this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">god</span> was called, and Balam-Quitzé put him on
his back, in his chest. Instantly the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">god</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Avilix appeared, and Balam-Acab carried him.
The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">god</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Hacavitz was carried by Mahucutah; and Iqui-Balam carried the one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span>

Tohil was also the name of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">god</span> who was received
by the grandfathers and the fathers of the lords, whom we also know today.
In this way, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> Quiché [families] were given their names and they did not separate,

And there it was that the speech of the tribes
changed; their tongues became different. They could no longer understand each other clearly
after arriving at Tulán. There also they separated, there were some who had to go to the East,
but many came here.
And their clothing was only the skins of animals; they had no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> clothes to put on, the skins
of animals were their only dress. They were poor, they possessed nothing, but they had the

When they arrived at Tulán-Zuivá, Vucub-Pec, Vucub-Zivan, the old traditions say that they
had traveled far in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> to arrive there.

And they did not have fire. Only the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> of Tohil had it. He was the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">god</span> of the tribes
which first <span class="t16 hoverable">created</span> fire. It is not known how it was made, because it was already burning
when Balam-Quitzé and Balam-Acab saw it.
"Ah, we have no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> yet! We shall die of cold," they said. Then Tohil said to them: "Do not

fire," Tohil said to them.

"Really? Oh, God, our support, our maintenance, thou, our God!" they said, returning thanks.
And Tohil answered: "Very well, certainly I am your God; so shall it be! I am your Lord; so
let it be!" <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> it was told to the priests and sacrificers by Tohil. And in this manner the tribes

Instantly a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> shower began to fall when the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> of the tribes was burning. Much hail fell
on all the tribes and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> was put out because of it, and again the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> was extinguished.
Then Balam-Quitzé and Balam-Acab again asked Tohil for fire. "Oh, Tohil, we are truly
dying of cold!" they said to Tohil.
"Very well, do not worry," Tohil answered, and instantly he made fire, turning about in his
shoe.
Balam-Quitzé, Balam-Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui-Balam were at once happy and
immediately they became warm.
Now, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> of the peoples [of Vucamag] had also gone out and they were dying of cold.
immediately they came to ask Balam-Quitzé, Balam-Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui-Balam for
fire. They could no longer bear the cold nor the ice; they were shivering and their teeth were
chattering; they were numb; their legs and <span class="t13 t23 hoverable">hands</span> shook and they could not hold anything in
them, when they came.
"We are not ashamed to come before you, to beg for a little of your fire," they said. But they
were not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> received. And then the tribes were very sad.
"The speech of Balam-Quitzé, Balam-Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui-Balam is different! Oh! We
have given up our speech! What have we done? We are lost. How were we deceived? We had
only one speech when we arrived there at Tulán; we were <span class="t16 hoverable">created</span> and educated in the same
way. It is not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> what we have done," said all the tribes under the trees, under the vines.
Then a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> came before Balam-Quitzé, Balam-Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui-Balam and [this
man], who was a messenger of Xibalba, spoke thus: "This is, in truth, your God; this is your

not give your <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> to the tribes until they present offerings to Tohil. It is not necessary that
they give anything to you. Ask Tohil what they should give when they come to receive fire,"
said the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> from Xibalba. He had wings like the wings of a bat. "I am sent by your Creator,
your Maker," said the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> of Xibalba.
They were filled with joy then, and Tohil, Avilix, and Hacavitz were also gladdened when the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> from Xibalba spoke, who disappeared instantly from their presence.
But the tribes did not perish when they came, although they were dying of cold. There was
much hail, black rain and mist, and indescribable cold.
All the tribes were trembling and shivering with cold when they came where Balam-Quitzé,
Balam-Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui-Balam were. Their hearts were greatly troubled and their
mouths and <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> were sad.

In a moment the beggars came before Balam-Quitzé, Balam-Acab, Mahucutah, and IquiBalam and said: "Will you not have pity on us, we only ask a little of your fire? Perchance,
were we not [once] <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> and reunited? Did we not have the same home and one country
when we were created, when we were made? Have mercy, then, on us!" they said.
"What will you give us so that we shall have mercy on you?" they were asked.
"Well, then, we shall give you money," the tribes answered.
"We do not want money," said Balam-Quitzé and Balam-Acab.
"And what do you want?" [asked the tribes].
"We shall ask now" [said Balam-Quitzé].
"Very well, "said the tribes.
"We shall ask Tohil and then we shall tell you," they answered.
"What must the tribes give, oh, Tohil! who have come to ask for your fire?" said BalamQuitzé, Balam-Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui-Balam.
"Well! Are they willing to give their waist and their armpits? Do they want me to embrace
them? For if they do not want to do that, neither shall I give them fire," answered Tohil.
"Tell them that this shall come later, that they do not have to come now to give me their waist
and their armpits. This is what Tohil orders us to tell you, you will say." This was the answer
to Balam-Quitzé, Balam-Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui-Balam.
Then they <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> Tohil's message. "Very well, we shall join you and we shall embrace him,"
they [the people] said when they <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> and were told the message from Tohil. And they did
not delay in acting. "Good," they said, "but may it be soon!" And immediately they received
the fire. Then they became warm.

There was nevertheless a tribe who stole the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> in the smoke; and they were from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span>
of Zotzil. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">god</span> of the Cakchiquel was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Chamalcán and he had the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of a bat.
When they passed through the smoke, they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> softly and then they seized the fire. The
Cakchiquel did not ask for the fire, because they did not want to give themselves up to be
overcome, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> that the other tribes had been overcome when they offered their breasts
and their armpits so that they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be opened. And this was the opening [of the breasts]
about which Tohil had spoken; that they should <span class="t2 t9 t10 t16 t18 t19 t27 t28 hoverable">sacrifice</span> all the tribes before him, that they
should tear out their hearts from their breasts.
And this had not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> begun when the taking of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> and sovereignty by Balam-Quitzé,
Balam.-Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui-Balam was prophesied by Tohil.

There in Tulán-Zuivá, whence they had come, they were accustomed to fast, they observed a
perpetual fast while they awaited the coming of dawn and watched for the rising sun.
They <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> turns at watching the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Great</span> Star <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Icoquih, which rises first before the sun,
when the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> rises, the brilliant Icoquih, which was always before them in the East, when they
were there in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Tulán-Zuivá, whence came their god.
It was not here, then, where they received their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> and sovereignty, but there they subdued
and subjected the large and small tribes when they sacrificed them before Tohil, and offered
him the blood, the substance, breasts, and sides of all the men.
In Tulán <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> came instantly to them; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> was their <span class="t12 t20 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">wisdom</span> in the darkness and in the
night.
Then they came, they pulled up stakes there and <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> the East. "This is not our home; let us go
and see where we should settle," Tohil said then.
In truth, he was accustomed to talk to Balam-Quitzé, Balam-Acab, Mahucutah, and IquiBalam: "Give thanks before setting out; do what is necessary to bleed your ears, prick your
elbows, and make your sacrifices, this shall be your thanks to God."
"Very well, "they said, and <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> blood from their ears. And they wept in their chants because
of their departure from Tulán; their hearts mourned when they <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> Tulán.
"Pity us! We shall not see the dawn here, when the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> rises and lights the face of the earth,"
they said at leaving. But they <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> on the road which they followed so that they

Each of the tribes kept getting up to see the star which was the herald of the sun. This sign of
the dawn they carried in their hearts when they came from the East, and with the same hope
they <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> there, from that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> distance, according to what their songs now say.

They came at last to the top of a mountain and there all the Quiché <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> and the tribes were
reunited. There they all held council to make their plans. Today this mountain is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> ChiPixab, this is the name of the mountain.
There they reunited and there they extolled themselves: "I am, I, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> of the Quiché!
And thou, Tamub, that shall be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thy</span> name." And to those from Ilocab they said: "Thou, Ilocab,
this shall be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thy</span> name. And these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> Quiché [peoples] shall not disappear, our fate is the
same," they said when they gave them their names.
Then they gave the Cakchiquel their name: Gagchequeleb was their name. In the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span>
they named those of Rabinal, which was their name, and they still have it. And also those of
Tziquinahá, as they are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> today. Those are the names which they gave to each other.

There they were come <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> to await the dawn and to watch for the coming of the star,
which comes just before the sun, when it is about to rise. "We came from there, but we have
separated," they said to each other.
And their hearts were troubled; they were suffering greatly; they did not have food; they did
not have sustenance; they only smelled the ends of their staffs and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> they imagined they
were eating; but they did not <span class="t28 hoverable">eat</span> when they came.
It is not quite clear, however, how they crossed the sea; they crossed to this side, as if there
were no sea; they crossed on stones, placed in a row over the sand. For this <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> they were
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Stones in a Row, Sand Under the Sea, names given to them when they [the tribes]
crossed the sea, the waters having parted when they passed.
And their hearts were troubled when they talked together, because they had nothing to eat,
only a drink of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> and a handful of corn they had.
There they were, then, assembled on the mountain <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Chi-Pixab. And they had also
<span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> Tohil, Avilix, and Hacavitz. Balam-Quitzé and his wife Cahá-Paluna, which was the
name of his wife, observed a complete fast. And so did Balam-Acab and his wife, who was
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Chomihá; and Mahucutah and his wife, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Tzununihá, also observed a complete

And there were those who fasted in the darkness, and in the night. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Great</span> was their sorrow

Put each of us, then. in a safe place," they said when they spoke.
"Very well. We shall go on, we shall go in search of the forests," all answered.
Immediately after, they <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> up their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> and put them on their backs.

In the same way, Mahucutah <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> his god, who was the <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> one hidden by them.
Hacavitz was not in the forest, but on a hill cleared of trees, Hacavitz was hidden.
Then Balam-Quitzé came, he came there to the large forest; Balam-Quitzé came to hide Tohil
at the hill which is today <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Patohil. Then they celebrated the hiding of Tohil in the

ravine, in his refuge. A <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> quantity of snakes, jaguars, vipers, and cantiles were in the
forest where they were hidden by the priests and sacrificers.
Balam-Quitzé, Balam-Acab, Mahucutah. and Iqui-Balam were together; <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> they awaited

There they were together, then, Balam-Quitzé. Balam-Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui-Balam.
They did not sleep; they remained standing and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> was the anxiety of their hearts and their
stomachs for the coming of dawn and the day. There, too, they felt shame; they were
overcome with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> sorrow, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> suffering. and they were oppressed with pain.
They had come that far. "Oh. we have come <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> joy! If only we could see the rising of the
sun! What shall we do now? If we lived in harmony in our country, why did we leave it?"
they said to each other, in the midst of their sadness and affliction, and with mournful voices.
They talked, but they could not calm their hearts which were anxious for the coming of the
dawn. "The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> are seated in the ravines, in the forests, they are among the air-plants, among
the mosses, not even a seat of boards were they given," they said.
First there were Tohil, Avilix, and Hacavitz. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Great</span> was their glory, their strength, and their

Many were their miracles, and countless their journeys,
and their pilgrimages in the midst of the cold; and the hearts of the tribes were filled with fear.
But calm were the hearts of Balam-Quitzé, Balam-Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui-Balam. With
respect to them [the gods]. They felt no anxiety in their hearts for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> whom they had
received, and had carried on their backs when they came there from Tulán-Zuivá, from there
in the East.
They were there, then, in the forest, now <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Zaquiribal, Pa-Tohil, P'Avilix, Pa-Hacavitz.
And next came the dawn, and <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> shone for our grandparents and our parents.
Now we shall tell of the coming of the dawn and the appearance of the sun, the moon, and the
stars.

Here, then, is the dawn, and the coming of the sun, the moon, and the stars.
Balam-Quitzé, Balam-Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui-Balam were very happy when they saw the
Morning Star. It rose first, with shining face, when it came ahead of the sun.
Immediately they unwrapped the incense which they had <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> from the East, and which
they had planned to burn, and then they untied the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> gifts which they had planned to offer.
The incense which Balam-Quitzé <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Mixtán-Pom; the incense which BalamAcab <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Cavixtán-Pom; and that which Mahucutah <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span>
Cabauil-Pom. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> had their incense and burned it when they began to dance facing
toward the East.
They wept for joy as they danced and burned their incense, their precious incense. Then they
wept because they did not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> <span class="t0 t6 t7 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t17 t20 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">behold</span> nor see the sunrise.
But, then, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> came up. The small and large animals were happy; and arose from the
banks of the river, in the ravines, and on the tops of the mountains, and all turned their <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> to
where the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> was rising.
Then the puma and the jaguar roared. But first the bird <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Queletzú burst into song. In
truth, all the animals were happy, and the eagle, the white vulture; the small birds and the
large birds stretched their wings.
The Priests and the sacrificers were kneeling; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> was the joy of the priests and sacrificers
and of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> of Tamub and Ilocab and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> of Rabinal, the Cakchiquel, those from
Tziquinahá, and those from Tuhalhá, Uchabahá, Quibahá, from Batená, and the Yaqui Tepeu,
all those tribes which exist today. And it was not possible to count the people. The <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> of

Instantly the surface of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> was dried by the sun. Like a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> was the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> when it
showed itself, and its face glowed when it dried the surface of the earth.
Before the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> rose, damp and muddy was the surface of the earth, before the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> came up;
but then the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> rose, and came up like a man. And its heat was unbearable. It showed itself
when it was <span class="t16 t24 hoverable">born</span> and remained fixed [in the sky] like a mirror. Certainly it was not the same
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> which we see, it is said in their old tales.
Immediately afterward Tohil, Avilix, and Hacavitz were turned to stone, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> with the
deified <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> the puma, the jaguar, the snake, the cantil, and the hobgoblin. Their arms
became fastened to the trees when the sun, the moon, and the stars appeared. All alike, were
changed into stone. Perhaps we should not be living today because of the voracious animals,
the puma, the jaguar, the snake, and the cantil, as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as the hobgoblin; perhaps our <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span>

When the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> arose, the hearts of Balam-Quitzé, Balam-Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui-Balam
were filled with joy. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Great</span> was their joy when it dawned. And there were not many <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> at

that place; only a few were there on the mountain Hacavitz. There dawn came to them, there
they burned their incense and danced, turning their gaze toward the East, whence they had
come. There were their mountains and their valleys, whence had come Balam-Quitzé, BalamAcab, Mahucutah, and Iqui-Balam, as they were called.
But it was here where they multiplied, on the mountain, and this was their town; here they
were, too, when the sun, the moon, and the stars appeared, when it dawned and the face of the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> was lighted. Here, too, began their song, which they <span class="t3 t11 t18 t27 hoverable">call</span> camucú;
they sang it, but only the pain in their hearts and their innermost selves they expressed in their
song. "Oh pity us! In Tulán we were lost, we were separated, and there our older and younger
brothers stayed. Ah, we have seen the sun! but where are they now, that it has dawned?" so
said the priests and the sacrificers of the Yaqui.
Because, in truth, the so-called Tohil is the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">god</span> of the Yaqui, the one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> YolcuatQuitzalcuat.

our race was <span class="t16 hoverable">created</span> when we came," they said to each other.

They felt much grief in their hearts, there in Hacavitz; and sad, too, were the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> from

the priests and sacrificers of Tamub and to their god, who also was Tohil, because one and the

wanted to make their speech the same as that of the Quiché.
Well, the speech of the Cakchiquel is different, because the name of their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">god</span> was different
when they came from there, from Tulán-Zuyva. Tzotzihá Chimalcan was the name of their
god, and today they <span class="t9 t11 t20 t21 t22 t23 t27 hoverable">speak</span> a different tongue; and also from their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">god</span> the families of

And now we shall tell of their stay and abode there on the mountain, where the four <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span>
Balam-Quitzé, Balam-Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui-Balam were together. Their hearts mourned
for Tohil, Avilix, and Hacavitz, whom they had placed among the air-plants and the moss.
We shall tell now how they made the sacrifices at the foot of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> where they had carried
Tohil, when they arrived in the presence of Tohil and Avilix. They <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> to see them, to greet

them, and also to give them thanks for the arrival of the dawn. They were in the thicket amidst
the stones, there in the woods. And only by magic <span class="t2 t6 t8 t9 t10 t15 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">art</span> did they <span class="t9 t11 t20 t21 t22 t23 t27 hoverable">speak</span> when the priests and
sacrificers came before Tohil. They did not <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> gifts, only resin, the remains of the

Then Tohil spoke; only by a miracle he gave counsel to the priests and sacrificers. And they
[the gods] spoke and said: "Truly here shall be our mountains and our valleys. We are yours;

Yours are

"Do not show us before the tribes when we are angered by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> of their mouths, or
because of their conduct. Neither shall you permit us to fall into a snare. Give us, instead, the
creatures of the woods and of the fields, and also the female deer, and the female birds. Come
and give us a little of your blood, have pity <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> us. You may have the skins of the deer and

When they ask 'Where is Tohil?' show the deerskin before their eyes. Neither shall you show

who come to embrace us, shall be ours also," <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> spoke Tohil, Avilix, and Hacavitz.
They had the appearance of youths, when those who came to offer gifts saw them. Then the
persecution of the young of the birds and of the deer began, and the fruit of the chase was
received by the priests and sacrificers. And when they found the young of the birds and the
deer, they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> at once to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> the blood of the deer and of the birds in the mouths of the
stones, that were Tohil and Avilix.
As soon as the blood had been drunk by the gods, the stones spoke, when the priests and the
sacrificers came, when they came to <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> their offerings. And they did the same before their
symbols, burning pericón and holom-ocox.
The symbols of each one were there where they had been placed on the top of the mountain.
But they [the priests] did not live in their houses by day, but walked over the mountains, and
ate only the young horseflies, and the wasps, and the bees which they hunted; they had neither

And neither were the roads from their homes known, nor did they
know where their wives had remained.

NOW, THEN, MANY TOWNS WERE BEING founded, one by one, and the different
branches of the tribes were being reunited and settled close to the roads, their roads which
they had opened.
As for Balam-Quitzé, Balam-Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui-Balam, it was not known where they
were. But when they saw the tribes that passed on the roads, instantly they began to shout on
the mountain-tops, howling like a coyote, screaming like a mountain cat, and imitating the
roaring of the puma and the jaguar.

And the tribes seeing these things, as they walked, said: "Their screams are like those of the
coyote, of the mountain cat, of the puma, and of the jaguar. They want to appear to the tribes
as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> they are not men, and they only do this to deceive us, we the people. Their hearts
wish something. Surely, they do not frighten us with what they do. They mean something
with the roaring of the puma, with the noise of the jaguar which they break into when they see
one or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> walking; what they want is to make an end of us."
Every <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> they [the priests] came to their houses and to their women, carrying only the young
of the bumblebees and the wasps, and the honeybees to give to their women.
Every day, too, they came before Tohil, Avilix, and Hacavitz and said in their hearts: "Here
are Tohil, Avilix, and Hacavitz. We can offer them only the blood of the deer and the birds;
we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> only blood from our ears and our arms. Let us ask Tohil, Avilix, and Hacavitz for
strength and vigor. What will [the tribes] say about the deaths of the people, which, one by
one, we are killing?" they said to one another as they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> into the presence of Tohil, Avilix,
and Hacavitz.
Then they punctured their ears and their arms before the divinities; they caught their blood
and put it in a vase near the stones. They were not really stones, but each one appeared in the
likeness of a youth.
They were happy with the blood of the priests and sacrificers when they arrived with this
example of their work.
"Follow their tracks [those of the animals which they sacrificed], there is your salvation!
"From there, from Tulán, whence you <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> us," they were told, "came the skin, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span>

Here is how Balam-Quitzé, Balam-Acab, Mahucutah. and Iqui-Balam began the abduction of
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> of the tribes [of Vuc Amag].
Then came the killing of the tribes. They seized a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> as he walked alone, or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> when they
were walking together, and it was not known when they were seized, and then they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> to
<span class="t2 t9 t10 t16 t18 t19 t27 t28 hoverable">sacrifice</span> them before Tohil. and Avilix. Afterward they sprinkled the blood on the road and
placed the heads separately on the road. And the tribes said, "The jaguar ate them." And they
spoke <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> because like footprints of the jaguar were the tracks which they had left, although
they did not show themselves.
Already, many were the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> who had been carried off, but the tribes did not notice it until
later. "Could it be Tohil. and Avilix who have been here among us? It must be they who are
nourished by the priests and the sacrificers. Where are their homes? Let us follow their
footprints!" said all the people.
Then they held a council among themselves. Then they began to follow the footprints of the
priests and the sacrificers, but they were not clear. There were only tracks of wild animals,

tracks of jaguars that they saw, but the tracks were not distinct. The first ones were not clear
because they were reversed, as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> made so that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> astray, and their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> was
not clear. A mist formed, a black rain fell and made much mud; and it began to drizzle. This

following them on the roads, because the <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> of Tohil, Avilix, and Hacavitz were so <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>

they killed.

Tohil, Avilix, and Hacavitz had the appearance of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> youths and walked by virtue of the
magic stone. There was a river in which they bathed, at the edge of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> and only there
did they appear. For this <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> it was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> "in the Bathing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Place</span> of Tohil," and this was the
name of the river. Often the tribes saw them, but they disappeared immediately, when they
were seen by the people.
Then they had tidings of where Balam-Quitzé, Balam-Acab, Mahucutah. and Iqui-Balam
were, and at once the tribes held council as to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> in which they could be killed.
In the first <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> the tribes wanted to discuss the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> to overcome Tohil, Avilix, and
Hacavitz. And all the priests and sacrificers [of the tribes] said to the people: "Arise, all of
you, <span class="t3 t11 t18 t27 hoverable">call</span> everyone, let there be not one group, nor <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> groups, among us who remain behind

All assembled, they assembled in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> numbers and deliberated among themselves. And they
said, asking each other: "What shall we do to overcome the Quiché of Cavec by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> <span class="t13 t23 hoverable">hands</span>

And some said, turning to the tribes, when they spoke: "Who has seen those who bathe in the
river every day? If they are Tohil, Avilix, and Hacavitz, then we shall overcome them first,
and afterward, we shall begin the destruction of the priests and sacrificers." This, many of
them said, when they talked.
"But how shall we overcome them?" they asked again.
"This shall be our <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> of overcoming them. Since they have the appearance of youths when
they let themselves be seen in the water, then let <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> maidens who are really beautiful, and
very lovely, go and provoke in them <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> to possess them," they said.
"Very well. Let us go, then; let us <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> beautiful maidens," they exclaimed, and then they
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> to <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> their daughters. And truly beautiful were the maidens.
Then they instructed the maidens: "Go, our daughters, go to wash clothes at the river, and if
you see the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> youths, undress before them, and if their hearts <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> you, <span class="t3 t11 t18 t27 hoverable">call</span> to them. If

they say to you, 'May we come to you?' answer, 'Yes.' And when they ask: 'Where do you

"Then you shall say: 'Give us a token of yours.' And if after they have given you something,
they want to kiss your faces, really give yourselves to them. And if you do not give yourselves
to them, we shall kill you. Afterward our hearts shall be satisfied. When you have the token,

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> spoke the lords when they advised the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> maidens. Here are their names: Xtah was the
name of one of the maidens, and the other was Xpuch. And the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> maidens, Xtah and

was decided by all the tribes.
They <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> at once, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> adorned, and they were truly very beautiful when they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> there
where Tohil was bathing, so that they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be seen, when they were washing. When they
went, the lords were happy because they had sent their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> daughters.
As soon as the latter arrived at the river, they began to wash. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> had already <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> off
their clothes and were bending over the stones when Tohil, Avilix, and Hacavitz came. They
came there to the edge of the river and paused a moment, surprised to see the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> young girls
who were washing, and the girls became ashamed at the moment when Tohil came. But the

And then he asked them: "Where did you come from?" <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span>
he asked the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> maidens, and added: "What do you want that you come here to the edge of
our water?"
And they answered: "The lords have sent us to come here. 'Go look at the faces of Tohil and
<span class="t9 t11 t20 t21 t22 t23 t27 hoverable">speak</span> with them,' the lords told us; and 'then <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> proof that you have seen their faces.' they
told us." <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> girls spoke, making known the purpose of their coming.
Well, what the tribes wanted was that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> maidens <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be violated by the incarnation of
Tohil. But Tohil, Avilix, and Hacavitz said, speaking again to Xtah and Xpuch, as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span>
maidens were called: "Very well, with you shall go proof of our conversation. Wait a little
and then you shall give it to the lords." they said.
Then they held council with the priests and sacrificers and they said to Balam-Quitzé, BalamAcab, Mahucutah, and Iqui-Balam: "Paint <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> capes, paint on them the symbol of your

carry them back. Give the capes to them," Balam-Quitzé, Balam-Acab, and Mahucutah were
told.
At once the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> began to paint. First, Balam-Quitzé painted a jaguar; the figure was made
and painted on the surface of the cape. Then Balam-Acab painted the figure of an eagle on the
surface of a cape; and then Mahucutah painted bumblebees and wasps all over, figures and
drawings of which he painted on the cloth. And the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> finished their painting, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> pieces
they painted.
Then they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> to give the capes to Xtah and Xpuch, as they were called, and Balam-Quitzé.
Balam-Acab, and Mahucutah said to them: "Here is proof of your conversation [with us]; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span>
these before the lords: Say to them, 'In truth, Tohil has talked to us; here we <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> the proof,'
tell them, and have them dress themselves in the clothes which you will give them." This they

told the maidens when they bade them farewell. The latter <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> at once, carrying the abovementioned painted capes.
When they arrived, the lords were filled with joy to see their faces and their hands, from
which hung the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> the maidens had gone for.
"Did you see the face of Tohil?" they asked them.
"Yes, we saw it," answered Xtah and Xpuch.
"Very well. And you <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> the token, do you not?" the lords asked, thinking that this was the
proof of their sin.
Then the maidens held out the painted capes, all covered with [the figures] of jaguars and
eagles, and covered with bumblebees and wasps, painted on the surface of the cloth and which
shone before them. At once they felt a <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> to put the capes on.
The jaguar did nothing when the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">lord</span> threw the first painting on his back. Then the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">lord</span> put on
the <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> painting, with the figure of the eagle. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">lord</span> felt very <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> wrapped <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> it.
And he turned about before all of them.
Then he undressed before all, and put on the <span class="t7 hoverable">third</span> painted cape. And now he had on himself,
the bumblebees and wasps which were on it. Instantly the bumblebees and the wasps stung his
flesh. And not being able to suffer the stings of these insects, he began to scream because of
the insects <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> figures were painted on the cloth, the painting of Mahucutah, which was the
<span class="t7 hoverable">third</span> one that had been painted.

Then the lords reprimanded the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> maidens named Xtah and
Xpuch: "What kind of clothes are those which you have brought? Where did you go to <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span>

overcome by Tohil.
Well, what they [the lords] wanted was that Tohil should have gone to amuse himself with
Xtah and Xpuch, and that the [maidens] <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have become whores, for the tribes believed
that they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> serve to tempt them. But it was not possible that they should overcome them,
thanks to those miraculous men, Balam-Quitzé, Balam-Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui-Balam.

Afterwards the tribes held council again.
"What shall we do with them? in truth, their estate is very great," they said when they
assembled again in council.
"Well, then, we shall waylay them, we shall kill them, we shall arm ourselves with bows and
with shields. Perchance, are we not many? Let there not be one or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> among us who remains
behind." This they said when they held council. And all the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> armed. Many were the
warriors when all the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> gathered <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> for the killing.

Meanwhile, there were Balam-Quitzé, Balam-Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui-Balam, they were
on the mountain Hacavitz, on the hill of this name. They were there in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> to save their <span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t13 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">sons</span>
who were on the mountain.
And they did not have many people, they did not have multitudes such as the multitudes of
the tribes. The summit of the mountain where they had their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> was small, and for that
<span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> when the tribes assembled <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> and rose, they decided to kill all of them.
In this manner, then, <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> the reunion of all the people, all armed with their bows and
their shields. It is impossible to describe the richness of their arms; the appearance of all the
chiefs and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> was very beautiful, and certainly all obeyed their orders.
"They shall positively be destroyed, and as for Tohil. he shall be our god, we shall worship
him, if we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> him prisoner," they said to each other. But Tohil knew everything and so did
Balam-Quitzé, Balam-Acab, and Mahucutah. They <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> all the plans, because they did not
sleep, or rest, from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> the warriors armed themselves.
Then all the warriors rose up and started out on the road, intending to enter [the town] by
night. But they did not arrive, for all the warriors were watching on the road, and then they
were destroyed by Balam-Quitzé, Balam-Acab, and Mahucutah.
All remained watching along the road, but they <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> nothing and they finally fell asleep.
Then they [Balam-Quitzé, Balam-Acab, and Mahucutah] began to pull out their eyelashes and
their beards; they <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> off the metal ornaments from their throats--their crowns and necklaces.
And they <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> the metal from the handles of their spears. They did this to punish them and
humiliate them, and give them an example of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of the Quiché people.
When they [the warriors] awoke, they wanted to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> their crowns and their staffs, but they no
longer had metal in the staff-handles, nor their crowns. "Who has stripped us? Who has torn
out our beards? Whence have they come to rob us of our precious metals?" said all of the
warriors. "Can it be these devils who are carrying off the men? But they shall not succeed in
frightening us. We shall enter their town by force, and we shall again see the face of our
silver; this we shall do," said all the tribes, and all truly intended to carry out their word.
Meanwhile the hearts of the priests and the sacrificers on the summit of the mountain were
calm. And Balam-Quitzé, Balam-Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui-Balam having talked together,
they built a wall at the edge of the town and enclosed it with boards and thorns. Then they
made figures in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of men, and put them in rows on the wall, armed them with shields
and arrows and adorned them, putting metal crowns on their heads. These they put on the
simple wooden figures, they adorned them with the metal which they had <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> from the
tribes on the road and with them they decorated the figures.
They made a moat around the town, and then they asked advice of Tohil: "Shall they kill us?
Shall they overcome us?" their hearts said to Tohil.
"Do not be troubled! I am here. And this you will use. Do not be afraid," he [Tohil] said to
Balam-Quitzé, Balam-Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui-Balam, when they were given the
bumblebees and the wasps. This is what they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> to fetch. And when they came, they put
them inside four big gourds which were placed around the town. They shut the bumblebees
and wasps inside the gourds, in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> to fight the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> with them.

The <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">city</span> was watched from afar, spied <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> and observed by the scouts of the tribes. "They
are not many," they said. But they saw only the wooden figures which lightly moved their
bows and their shields. In truth, they had the appearance of men, had in <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> the appearance
of warriors when the tribes looked at them, and all the tribes were happy because they saw
that they were not many.
There were many tribes; it was not possible to count the people, the warriors and soldiers who
were going to kill Balam-Quitzé, Balam-Acab, and Mahucutah, who were on the mountain
Hacavitz, the name of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> where they were found.
Now we shall tell about their arrival.

IV. <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">Chapter</span> 4
They were there, then, Balam-Quitzé, Balam-Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui-Balam, were all
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> on the mountain with their wives and their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">children</span> when all the warriors and soldiers
came. The tribes did not <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> sixteen thousand, or twenty-four <span class="t15 t23 hoverable">thousand</span> men, [but even
more].
They surrounded the town, crying out loudly, armed with arrows and shields, beating drums,
giving war whoops, whistling, shouting, inciting them to fight, when they arrived in front of
the town.
But the priests and sacrificers were not frightened; they only looked at them from the edge of
the wall, where they were in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> with their wives and children. They <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> only of
the strength and the shouting of the tribes when they came up the <span class="t6 hoverable">side</span> of the mountain.
Shortly before they were about to throw themselves at the entrance of the town, the four
gourds which were at the edge of the town were opened and the bumblebees and the wasps
came out of the gourds; like a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> cloud of smoke they emerged from the gourds. And <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span>
the warriors perished because of the insects which stung the pupils of their <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> and fastened
themselves to their noses, their mouths, their legs, and their arms. "Where are they," they said,
"those who <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> to get and <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> in all the bumblebees and wasps that are here?"
They <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> straight to sting the pupils of their eyes, the little insects buzzing in swarms over
each one of the men; and the latter, stunned by the bumblebees and wasps, could no longer
grasp their bows and their shields, which were broken on the ground.
When the warriors fell, they were stretched out on the mountainside, and they no longer felt
when they were hit with arrows, and wounded by the axes. Balam-Quitzé and Balam-Acab
<span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> only blunt sticks. Their wives also <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> part in this killing. Only a part [of them] returned
and all the tribes began to flee. But the first ones caught were put to death; not a few of the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> died, and those who died were not the ones they intended to kill but those who were
attacked by the insects. Neither was it a deed of valor, because the warriors were not killed by
arrows or by shields.
Then all the tribes surrendered. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> humbled themselves before Balam-Quitzé, BalamAcab, and Mahucutah. "Have pity on us, do not kill us," they exclaimed.

"Very well. Although you deserve to die, you shall [instead] become [our] vassals for the rest
of your lives," they said to them.
In this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> were all of the tribes destroyed by our first mothers and fathers; and this happened
there on the mountain Hacavitz, as it is now called. This was where they first settled, where
they multiplied and increased, begot their daughters, gave being to their sons, on the mountain
Hacavitz.
They were, then, very happy when they had overcome all the tribes, whom they destroyed
there on the mountaintop. In this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> they carried out the destruction of the tribes, of all the
tribes. After this their hearts rested. And they said to their <span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t13 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">sons</span> that when they [the tribes]
intended to kill them, the hour of their own <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">death</span> was approaching.
And now we shall tell of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">death</span> of Balam-Quitzé, Balam-Acab, Mahucutah, and IquiBalam, as they were called.

And as they had had a presentiment of their death, they counseled their children. They were
not ill, they had neither pain nor agony when they gave their advice to their children.
These are the names of their sons: Balam-Quitzé had <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> sons, Qocaib the first was called,
and Qocavib was the name of the <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> of Balam-Quitzé, the grandfather and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">father</span> of
those of Cavec.
And these are the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> <span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t13 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">sons</span> which Balam-Acab begot, here are their names: Qoacul the first of
his <span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t13 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">sons</span> was called, and Qoacutec was the name of the <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> of Balam-Acab [the
founder] of those of Nihaib.
Mahucutah had but one son, who was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Qoahau.
Those <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> had sons, but Iqui-Balam did not have children. They were really the sacrificers,
and these are the names of their sons.
So, then, they bade [their sons] farewell. The four were <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> and they began to sing,
feeling sad in their hearts; and their hearts wept when they sang the camucú, as the song is
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> which they sang when they bade farewell to their sons.
"Oh, our sons! we are going, we are going away; sane advice and <span class="t8 t12 t17 hoverable">wise</span> counsel we leave you.
And you, also, who came from our distant country, oh our wives! they said to their women,
and they bade farewell to each one. "We are going back to our town, there already in his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span>

These <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> they said when they bade them farewell. Then Balam-Quitzé <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> the symbol of

mountain Hacavitz.
They [the four lords] were not buried by their wives nor by their children, because they were
not seen when they disappeared. Only their leaving was seen dearly, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> the bundle
was very dear to them. it was the reminder of their fathers and at once they burned incense
before this reminder of their fathers.
And then the lords, who succeeded Balam-Quitzé, begot new generations of men, and this
was the beginning of the grandfathers and fathers of those of Cavec; but their sons, those
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Qocaib and Qocavib, did not disappear.

And the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> being subdued already, and their grandeur ended, the tribes no longer had
power, and all lived to serve daily.
They remembered their fathers; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> was the <span class="t0 t7 t21 t27 hoverable">glory</span> of the bundle to them. Never did they
unwrap it, but it was always wrapped, and with them. Bundle of Greatness they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> it when
they extolled and named that which their fathers had <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> in their care as a symbol of their

In this manner, then, came about the disappearance and end of Balam-Quitzé, Balam-Acab,
Mahucutah, and Iqui-Balam, the first <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> who came there from the other <span class="t6 hoverable">side</span> of the sea,

And starting on their journey, they said: "We are going to the East, there whence came our
fathers." So they said when the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> <span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t13 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">sons</span> <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> out.

These, then, are the names of those who <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> there to the other <span class="t6 hoverable">side</span> of the sea; the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span>
then, and were endowed with <span class="t14 t24 hoverable">intelligence</span> and experience, but they were not common men.
They <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> leave of all their brothers and relatives and <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> joyfully. "We shall not die; we shall

Certainly they crossed the sea when they came there to the East, when they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> to receive
the investiture of the kingdom. And this was the name of the Lord, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span> of the East, where

only supreme judge of all the kingdoms, he gave them the insignia of the kingdom and all its
distinctive symbols. Then came the insignia of Ahpop and Ahpop-Camhá, and then the
insignia of the grandeur and the sovereignty of the Ahpop and the Ahpop-Camhá. And Nacxit
ended by giving them the insignia of royalty, which are: the canopy, the throne, the flutes of
bone, the cham-cham, yellow beads, puma claws, jaguar claws, the heads and feet of the deer,
dais, snail shells, tobacco, little gourds, parrot feathers, standards of royal aigrette feathers,
tatam, and caxcon. All the foregoing they carried, those who came after going to the other
<span class="t6 hoverable">side</span> of the sea to receive the paintings of Tulán, the paintings, as these were called, in which
they wrote their histories.
Then, having arrived at their town <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Hacavitz, all the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> of Tamub and of Ilocab
assembled there; all the tribes were assembled and were filled with joy when Qocaib,
Qoacutec, and Qoahau arrived, and there they again assumed the rule of the tribes.
The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> of Rabinal, the Cakchiquel, and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> of Tziquinahá rejoiced. Before them
they showed the insignia of the grandeur of the kingdom. Great, too, were the tribes, although
they had not finished showing their might. And they were there in Hacavitz, all were there
with those who came from the East. There they spent much time; there on the summit of the
mountain they were in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> numbers.
There, too, the wives of Balam-Quitzé, Balam-Acab, and Mahucutah died.
Later they left, abandoning their country, and searching for other places in which to settle.
innumerable were the places in which they settled, where they were, and which they named.
There our first mothers and our first fathers were reunited and increased. So said the old
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> when they told how they <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> their first capital, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Hacavitz, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> to found

They were a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> in this other town, where they had daughters and sons. There were
many of them there, and there were four other places, to each of which they gave the name of
their town. Their daughters and <span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t13 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">sons</span> married; they simply gave them away [in marriage] and
the presents and favors they received they considered as the price for their daughters, and, in
this way, they lived happily.
Afterward they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> through each one of the wards of the town, the different names of which
are: Chi-Quix, Chichac, Humetahá, Culbá, and Cavinal. These were the names of the places
where they settled. And they surveyed the hills and their towns and sought the uninhabited
places, for, all together, they were now very many.
Those who had gone to the East to receive the sovereignty were now dead. They were already
old when they arrived at each of the towns. They did not become accustomed to the different
places through which they passed; they suffered many hardships and troubles and only after a

which they came.
Finally Qocaib returned and gave an <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of his mission. "He <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> the titles of Ahpop,
Ahtzalam, Tzanchinamital, and many others; he showed the insignia which must accompany

these titles, and they were the claws of the jaguars and eagles, skins of other animals, and also
stones, sticks, etc." Seeing his wife with a newly <span class="t16 t24 hoverable">born</span> child in her arms, he asked whence it
had come. "'It is of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thy</span> blood,' answered the woman, 'of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thy</span> <span class="t21 hoverable">flesh</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thy</span> same bones.'"
Qocaib accepted the explanation, and taking the child's cradle said: "'From today on, and
forever this child shall be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Balam Conaché.'

they returned satisfied to Hacavitz Chipal, and displayed the signs and symbols which they
brought.}

And there they were in Izmachí with only one thought, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> disputes or difficulties,

This, then, was the beginning of the revolution and the dissensions of the war. First they
attacked the town, and the warriors came. And what they wanted was to ruin the Quiché race;
they wanted to reign alone. But they only came to die; they were captured and fell into
captivity, and few among them succeeded in escaping.
Immediately afterward the sacrifices began; the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> of Ilocab were sacrificed before the

There they identified themselves, and there they <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> their names; they distributed themselves
in clans in the seven principal tribes and in cantons.
"Let us unite, we of the Cavec, we of the Nihaib, and we of the Ahau-Quiché," said the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span>

AFTER THEY HAD <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">LEFT</span> THERE, THEY CAME here to the town of Gumarcaah, as the
Quiché named it when Kings Cotuhá and Gucumatz and all the lords came. There had then
begun the fifth generation of men, since the beginning of civilization and of the population,
the beginning of the <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> of the nation.
There, then, they built many houses and at the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> constructed the temple of God; in
the center of the <span class="t23 hoverable">high</span> part of the town they located it when they arrived and settled there.
Then their empire grew. They were very numerous, when they held their council in their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>
houses. They reunited, but later divided, because dissensions had arisen and jealousies grew
up amongst them over the price for their sisters and their daughters, and because they no
longer drank together.
This, then, was the <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> why they divided and why they turned against each other, and they
threw the skulls of the dead, they hurled them around among each other.

Then they divided into nine families, and having ended the dispute over the sisters and the
daughters, they carried out the plan of dividing the kingdom into twenty-four <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> houses, as
they did.

There they increased, there they installed their splendid thrones and royal seats, and they
distributed their honors among all the lords. The nine lords of Cavec formed nine families; the
lords of Nihaib formed another nine; the lords of Ahau-Quiché formed another four; and the
lords of Zaquic formed another <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> families.
They became very numerous, and many also followed each of the lords; these were the first
among their vassals, and each of the lords had large families.
We shall tell now the names of the lords of each of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> houses. Here, then, are the names
of the lords of Cavec. The first of the lords was Ahpop, [then] Ahpop-Camhá, Ah-Tohil, AhGucumatz, Nim-Chocoh-Cavec, Popol-Vinac-Chituy, Lolmet-Quehnay, Popol-Vinac Pa-Hom
Tzalatz, and Uchuch-Camhá.
These, then, were the lords of Cavec, nine lords, each one of which had his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> house, which
afterward will appear again.
Here then are the lords of Nihaib. The first was Ahau-Galel, then Ahau-Ahtzic-Vinac, GalelCamhá, Nima-Camhá, Uchuch-Camhá, Nim-Chocoh-Nihaibab, Avilix, Yacolatam, Utzampop-Zalclatol, and Nimá-Lolmet-Ycoltux, the nine lords of Nihaib.
And as for those of Ahau-Quiché, these are the names of the lords: Ahtzic-Vinac, AhauLolmet, Ahau-Nim-Chocoh-Ahau, and Ahau-Hacavitz, four lords of Ahau-Quiché, in the

they built the town of the ravines out of stone and mortar.
Then the small tribes and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> tribes came before the king. The Quiché increased when

And they were not cheating them, nor robbing them, nor seizing them by force, because in
reality each belonged to the lords, and many of their brothers and relatives had come <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span>

But it did not happen that all the tribes delivered themselves up, and neither did the country
and towns [the inhabitants of them] fall in battle, but instead they increased, because of the
marvels of the lords, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span> Gucumatz and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span> Cotuhá.

aggrandized the Quiché; for surely they were of marvelous nature.
Here is the destruction and division of the fields and the towns of the neighboring nations,
small and large. Among them was that, which in olden times, was the country of the
Cakchiquel, the present Chuvilá, and the country of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> of Rabinal, Pamacá, the

They were made slaves, they were wounded, and they were killed with arrows against the
trees [to which they had been tied] and for them there was no longer any glory, they no longer
had power. In this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> came about the destruction of the towns, which were instantly razed to

Before Colché, as a symbol of a town destroyed by him, there is now a pile of stones, which
look almost as if they had been cut With the edge of an ax. it is there on the coast, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span>

founded something like towns in the occupied places. "Just in <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> by chance the tribes might

Then they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> out to [take up] their positions. "These shall be like our forts and our town,

have a different god, when they went. They <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> only to fortify their towns.

They <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> at once and they <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> captives; they <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> their prisoners into the presence of
Quicab, Cavizimah, the Galel, and the Ahtzic-Vinac. The bowmen and slingers made war,
taking captives and prisoners. Some of the defenders of he positions were heroes, and the
lords gave [them gifts] and lavished rewards <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> them, when they came to deliver up all

Later they gathered in council by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> of the lords, the Ahpop, the Ahpop-Camhá, the Galel,
and the Ahtzic-Vinac, and they decided and said, that those who were there first should have
the rank of representing their families. "I am the Ahpop! I am the Ahpop-Camhá! Mine shall
be the rank of the Ahpop; meanwhile thou, the Ahau-Galel, shall have the rank of Galel," said
all the lords when they held council.
Those of Tamub and of Ilocab did likewise; equal in position were the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> clans of the

This was the result of the council. But they were not made captains here in Quiché. The
mountain where the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t13 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">sons</span> and vassals were made captains for the first <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> has its name, when
all were sent, each one to his mountain, and all were reunited. Xebalax and Xecamax are the
names of the mountains where they were made captains and they received their commands.
This happened in Chulimal.
In this manner was the naming, the promotion, and distinction of the twenty Galel, of the
twenty Ahpop, who were named by the Ahpop and the Ahpop-Camhá and by the Galel and
the Ahtzic-Vinac. All of the Galel-Ahpops received their rank: eleven Nim-Chocoh, GalelAhau, Galel-Zaquic, Galel-Achih, Rahpop-Achih, Rahtzalam-Achih, Utzam-Achih were the
names which the warriors received when their titles and distinctions were conferred <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span>

Quiché nation, their spies, their scouts, the bowmen, the slingers, the walls, doors, forts, and
bastions of the Quiché.
Those of Tamub and Ilocab also did thus; they named and ennobled the first <span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t13 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">sons</span> and vassals
who were in each place.
This, then, was the origin of the Galel-Ahpops, and of the titles which are now preserved in
each one of these places. This is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> their titles were created, by the Ahpop and the

One only was the origin of their tradition and [one only] the origin of the manner of

they <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> there in Quiché what all of them were to do.
But it was not only <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> that they reigned. They did not squander the gifts of those whom they
sustained and nourished, but they ate and drank them. Neither did they buy them; they had
won and seized their empire, their power, and their sovereignty.
And it was not at small cost, that they conquered the fields and the towns; the small towns and
the large towns paid <span class="t23 hoverable">high</span> ransoms; they <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> precious stones and metals, they <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span>

marvelous kings Gucumatz and Cotuhá, and before Quicab and Cavizimah, the Ahpop, the
Ahpop-Camhá, the Galel and the Ahtzic-Vinac.
It was not little what they did, neither were few, the tribes which they conquered. Many
branches of the tribes came to pay tribute to the Quiché; <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span> of sorrow they came to give it
over. Nevertheless, the [Quiché] <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> did not grow quickly. Gucumatz it was, who began

And now we shall name the generations of the lords and give their names; again we shall
