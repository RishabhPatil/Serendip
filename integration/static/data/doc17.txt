established by modern science. In reality, there is no such thing as a

seem to be contradictions unless scientific conclusions are consulted

In preparing this <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> edition of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Knowledge</span> of the Higher Worlds
and Its Attainment I have gone over <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> detail of the subject as I had
presented it over ten <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span> ago. The urge to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> such a review is
natural in the case of disclosures concerning <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> experiences and paths
such as are indicated in this book. There can be no portion of what is
imparted which does not remain intimately a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> who
communicates it, or which does not contain something that perpetually
<span class="t9 t16 t26 hoverable">works</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> his soul. And it is inevitable that this <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t7 t10 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span>
should be joined by an endeavor to enhance the clarity and lucidity of
the presentation as <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span> before. This engendered what I have
endeavored to accomplish in this <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> edition. All the essential
elements of the expositions, all the principal points, have remained as
they were; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> important changes have been made.

have been able to increase the accuracy of characterization in detail,
and this seemed to me important. If anyone wishes to apply what is
imparted in this <span class="t25 hoverable">book</span> to his own <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> life, it is important that he
should be able to contemplate the paths in question by <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t14 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">means</span> of a
characterization as exact as possible. Misconceptions can arise in <span class="t6 t9 t18 t26 hoverable">far</span>
greater measure in connection with the description of inner <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span>
processes than with that of facts in the physical world. The mobility of
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> life, the danger of losing sight of how <span class="t1 t2 t18 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">different</span> it is from all

misunderstandings possible. In preparing this <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> edition I have
directed my attention to finding passages in which misconceptions
<span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t18 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">might</span> arise, and I have endeavored to forestall them.
At the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> I wrote the essays that constitute this book, <span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">much</span> had
to be discussed in a <span class="t1 t2 t18 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">different</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> from today, because at that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> I
had to allude in a <span class="t1 t2 t18 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">different</span> manner to the substance of what had been
published since then concerning facts of cognition of the <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span>
worlds. In my Occult Science, in The <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">Spiritual</span> Guidance of Mankind,
in A Road to Self-Knowledge and the Threshold of the <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">Spiritual</span> World,

what this referred to has since been published. But these allusions
perhaps did not wholly exclude the possibility of erroneous ideas in the

everything which is truly venerable. His entire soul-life finds in this
fundamental feeling its pivot. Just as the sun's rays vivify everything
living, so does reverence in the student vivify all feelings of the soul.
It is not easy, at first, to believe that feelings <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> reverence and respect

inclined to <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t15 t17 t18 t19 hoverable">set</span> cognition aside as a faculty by itself — <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> that stands in no

strong, especially strong for the activity of cognition. Disrespect,
antipathy, underestimation of what deserves recognition, all exert a
paralyzing and withering effect on this faculty of cognition. For the
spiritually experienced this fact is visible in the aura. A <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> which harbors

and these steps result from the exact observation of such rules as are here
given. For all who earnestly will, the path stands open to tread.

tranquility; equally simple is its observation. But it only achieves its
purpose when it is observed in as earnest and strict a manner as it is, in
itself, simple. How this rule is to be observed will, therefore, be explained

will not and need not succeed with present occurrences of destiny, but it
should be attempted by the student in connection with the events of
destiny already experienced in the past. The value of such inner tranquil

<span class="t1 t2 t18 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">different</span> thought. Henceforth he <span class="t1 t7 t9 t14 t15 t17 t25 t28 hoverable">says</span> to himself: “I will summon all my

<span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> which makes him faint-hearted; for he knows that this very

<span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> after thought, each fraught with advantage to his <span class="t3 t5 t7 t9 t20 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> life, flows
into the student's outlook. They <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">take</span> the <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> of those that had a

course through the waves of life, whereas it was formerly battered to and

This calm and serenity react on the <span class="t3 t5 t7 t9 t20 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> being. They assist the growth of
the inner man, and, with the inner man, those faculties <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> grow which
lead to higher knowledge. For it is by his progress in this direction that the
student gradually reaches the point where he himself determines the
manner in which the impressions of the outer <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> affect him. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span>

He discovers that something living expresses itself in this thought-world.
He sees that his thoughts do not merely harbor shadow-pictures, but that

becomes audible to him. Formerly sound only reached him through his

and possessed of the <span class="t0 t1 t3 t5 t7 t8 t13 t16 t18 t20 t21 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> were inspired at such moments. He should start
with the writings which themselves had their origin in just such revelation
during meditation. In the mystic, gnostic and <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> scientific literature
of today the student will find such writings, and in them the material for
his meditation. The seekers of the <span class="t0 t1 t3 t5 t7 t8 t13 t16 t18 t20 t21 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> have themselves <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t15 t17 t18 t19 hoverable">set</span> down in such
writings the thoughts of the <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> science which the <span class="t0 t1 t3 t5 t7 t8 t13 t16 t18 t20 t21 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">Spirit</span> has directed
his messengers to proclaim to the world.
Through such meditation a complete transformation takes <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> in the
student. He begins to <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> quite <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> conceptions of reality. All <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span>
acquire a fresh value for him. It <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">cannot</span> be repeated too often that this
transformation does not alienate him from the world. He will in no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> be
estranged from his daily tasks and duties, for he comes to realize that the
most insignificant action he has to accomplish, the most insignificant
experience which offers itself to him, stands in connection with cosmic
beings and cosmic events. When once this connection is revealed to him in
his moments of contemplation, he comes to his daily activities with a new,
fuller power. For now he knows that his labor and his suffering are <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span>
and endured for the sake of a great, spiritual, cosmic whole. Not
weariness, but strength to live springs from meditation.
With firm step the student passes through life. No matter what it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span>
<span class="t22 hoverable">bring</span> him, he goes forward erect. In the past he knew not why he labored
and suffered, but now he knows. It is obvious that such meditation leads
more surely to the goal if conducted under the direction of experienced

The existence of this eternal being can only be doubted by those who have
not themselves experienced it. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> meditation is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span>

attain such knowledge? In <span class="t27 hoverable">right</span> meditation the path is opened. This alone
can revive the memory of experiences beyond the border of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> and death.

The Stages of Initiation
The information <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> in the following chapters constitutes steps in an
esoteric training, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> and character of which will be understood by
all who apply this information in the <span class="t27 hoverable">right</span> way. It refers to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> stages
through which the training of the <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> leads to a <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> degree of
initiation. But only so <span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">much</span> will here be explained as can be publicly
imparted. These are merely indications extracted from a still deeper and
more intimate doctrine. In esoteric training itself a quite definite course of
instruction is followed. <span class="t3 hoverable">Certain</span> exercises enable the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> to attain to a
conscious intercourse with the <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> world. These exercises bear about
the same relation to what will be imparted in the following pages, as the
instruction <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> in a higher strictly disciplined school bears to the
incidental training. But impatient dabbling, devoid of earnest
perseverance, can lead to <span class="t15 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">nothing</span> at all. The study of <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">Spiritual</span> Science can
only be successful if the student retain what has already been indicated in
the preceding chapter, and on the basis of this proceed further.
The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> stages which the above-mentioned tradition specifies, are as
follows: (1) preparation; (2) enlightenment; (3) initiation. It is not
altogether necessary that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> of these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> stages should be
completed before the <span class="t6 hoverable">second</span> can be begun, nor that the second, in turn, be
completed before the third be started. In <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> respects it is possible to
partake of enlightenment, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> of initiation, and in other respects still

in the stage of preparation before any enlightenment can begin; and, at
least in some respects, enlightenment <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> be completed before it is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span>

necessary, for the sake of clarity, that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> stages be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> to follow in

Preparation
Preparation consists in a strict and definite cultivation of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of
<span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> and feeling, through which the psycho-spiritual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> becomes
equipped with higher senses and organs of activity in the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> that
natural forces have fitted the physical <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> with organs built out of
indeterminate living matter.
To begin with, the attention of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> is directed to <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> events in the

budding, growing, and flourishing, and on the other hand, all phenomena
connected with fading, decaying, and withering. The student can observe
these events simultaneously, wherever he turns his eyes and on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span>

ordinary circumstances he does not devote himself sufficiently to them.
He hurries on too quickly from impression to impression. It is necessary,
therefore, that he should fix his attention intently and consciously <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span>

surrender himself, for a short time, to this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> impression. He will soon
convince himself that a feeling which heretofore in a similar case, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span>

powerful and energetic form. He <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> now allow this feeling to

that the attention should be directed with perfect inner balance <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> both

yourself to the feeling which expands to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> in the soul, then, in due time,
the following experience will ensue. Thoughts and feelings of a <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> kind
and unknown before will be noticed uprising in the soul. Indeed, the more
often the attention be fixed alternately <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> something growing,

decaying, the more vivid will these feelings become. And just as the eyes
and ears of the physical <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> are built by natural forces out of living
matter, so will the organs of clairvoyance build themselves out of the
feelings and thoughts <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> evoked. A quite definite <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of feeling is
connected with growth and expansion, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">another</span> equally definite with
all that is fading and decaying. But this is only the case if the effort be
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> to cultivate these feelings in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> indicated. It is possible to
describe approximately what these feelings are like. A full conception of
them is <span class="t5 t7 hoverable">within</span> the reach of all who undergo these inner experiences.
If the attention be frequently fixed on the phenomena of growing,
blooming and flourishing, a feeling remotely allied to the sensation of a
sunrise will ensue, while the phenomena of fading and decaying will
produce an experience comparable, in the same way, to the slow rising of
the moon on the horizon. Both these feelings are forces which, when duly
cultivated and developed to <span class="t29 hoverable">ever</span> increasing intensity, lead to the most
significant <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> results. A <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> is opened to the student if he
systematically and deliberately surrenders himself to such feelings. The
soul-world, the so-called astral plane, begins to dawn <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> him. Growth
and decay are no longer facts which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> indefinite impressions on him
as of old, but rather they <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> themselves into <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> lines and figures of

which he had previously suspected nothing. And these lines and figures
have, for the <span class="t1 t2 t18 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">different</span> phenomena, <span class="t1 t2 t18 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">different</span> forms. A blooming flower, an
animal in the process of growth, a tree that is decaying, evoke in his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span>
<span class="t1 t2 t18 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">different</span> lines. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> (astral plane) broadens out slowly before
him. These lines and figures are in no sense arbitrary. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Two</span> students who

same lines and figures under the same conditions. Just as a round table
will be seen as round by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> normal persons, and not as round by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> and
square by the other, so too, at the sight of a flower, the same <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span>
figure is presented to the soul. And just as the forms of animals and plants
are described in ordinary natural history, so too, the <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> scientist
describes or draws the <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> forms of the process of growth and decay,
<span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">according</span> to species and kind.
If the student has progressed so <span class="t6 t9 t18 t26 hoverable">far</span> that he can perceive the <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> forms
of those phenomena which are physically visible to his external sight, he is
then not <span class="t6 t9 t18 t26 hoverable">far</span> from the stage where he will <span class="t0 t5 t16 t22 hoverable">behold</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> which have no
physical existence, and which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> remain entirely hidden (occult)
from those who have not received suitable instruction and training.
It should be emphasized that the student <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> lose himself in
speculations on the <span class="t6 t13 t14 t25 t27 hoverable">meaning</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> thing or another. Such intellectualizing
will only draw him <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">away</span> from the <span class="t27 hoverable">right</span> road. He should look out on the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> with keen, healthy senses and quickened <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of observation, and
then <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> himself up to the feeling that arises <span class="t5 t7 hoverable">within</span> him. He should not
try to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> out, through intellectual speculation, the <span class="t6 t13 t14 t25 t27 hoverable">meaning</span> of things,
but rather allow the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> to disclose themselves. It should be remarked
that artistic feeling, when coupled with a quiet introspective nature, forms
the best preliminary condition for the development of <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> faculties.
This feeling pierces through the superficial aspect of things, and in so
doing touches their secrets.
A further point of importance is what <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> science calls orientation in
the higher worlds. This is attained when the student is permeated, through
and through, with the conscious realization that feelings and thoughts are
just as <span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">much</span> veritable realities as are tables and chairs in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> of the
physical senses. In the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> and <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> world, feelings and thoughts react

as the student is not vividly permeated with this consciousness, he will not
believe that a wrong <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> in his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> have as devastating an effect

will perhaps <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> allow himself to perform a physically visible action
which he considers to be wrong, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> he will not shrink from harboring
wrong thoughts and feelings, for these appear harmless to the rest of the
world. There can be no progress, however, on the path to higher

knowledge unless we guard our thoughts and feelings in just the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span>
we guard out steps in the physical world. If we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> a wall before us, we do
not attempt to dash <span class="t27 hoverable">right</span> through it, but turn aside. In other words, we
guide ourselves by the laws of the physical world. There are such laws,
too, for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> and <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> world, only they <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">cannot</span> impose themselves

This
can be attained if we forbid ourselves to harbor wrong thoughts and
feelings. All arbitrary flitting to and fro in thought, all accidental ebbing
and flowing of emotion <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> be forbidden in the same way. In so doing
we do not <span class="t8 t13 hoverable">become</span> deficient in feeling. On the contrary, if we regulate our

emotionalism and capricious flights of thought, there appear significant

lead the student to orientation in the <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> world. He gains a <span class="t27 hoverable">right</span>

definite result comes into effect in his favor. Just as he, as a physical man,
finds his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span> physical things, so, too, his path now leads him
between growth and decay, which he has already <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> to <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">know</span> in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span>

flourishing and, on the other, of withering and decaying in a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> that is
necessary for his own and the world's advancement.
The student has <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> to bestow a further care on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> of sound.

(lifeless) bodies, for instance, a bell, or a musical instrument, or a falling
mass, and those which proceed from a living creature (an animal or a

pleasant feeling with it; but when we hear the cry of an animal, we can,
besides our own feeling, detect through it the manifestation of an inward
experience of the animal, whether of pleasure or pain. It is with the latter
kind of sound that the student sets to work. He <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> concentrate his <span class="t3 t5 t7 t9 t20 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span>

his own soul. He <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> immerse himself in this foreign thing.

sound is pleasant or unpleasant, agreeable or disagreeable, and his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span>

sound proceeds. Through such exercises, if systematically and deliberately
performed, the student will develop <span class="t5 t7 hoverable">within</span> himself the faculty of
intermingling, as it were, with the being from which the sound proceeds.

student. What was hitherto merely incomprehensible noise to his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span>

hitherto he only heard sound from the so-called inanimate objects, he now
is aware of a <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> language of the soul. Should he advance further in this

expression of their assent, or more especially, of their dissent. In the
student, all such assent or dissent <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> be silenced. It is not imperative
that he should suddenly alter his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> of living by trying to attain at all
times to this complete inner silence. He will have to begin by doing so in
special cases, deliberately selected by himself. Then quite slowly and by

In
<span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> research this is systematically practiced. The student feels it his

assent, and more especially, all adverse criticism. The point is that in so
doing, not only all purely intellectual judgment be silenced, but <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> all

All higher truths are attained through such inwardly instilled speech, and
what we hear from the lips of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> teacher has been experienced

to acquaint ourselves with the writings of <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> science before we can
ourselves hear such inwardly instilled speech. On the contrary, the reading
of such writings and the listening to the teachings of <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> science are

study of what the <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> researchers impart to the world. In all esoteric
training such study belongs to the preparatory period, and all other
methods will prove ineffective if due receptivity for the teachings of the

Enlightenment
Enlightenment proceeds from very simple processes. Here, too, it is a
matter of developing <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> feelings and thoughts which slumber in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span>
<span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> being and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> be awakened. It is only when these simple
processes are carried out with unfailing patience, continuously and
conscientiously, that they can lead to the perception of the inner lightforms. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> step is <span class="t19 hoverable">taken</span> by observing <span class="t1 t2 t18 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">different</span> natural objects in a
particular way; for instance, a transparent and beautifully formed stone (a
crystal), a plant, and an animal. The student should endeavor, at first, to
direct his <span class="t3 t5 t7 t9 t20 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> attention to a comparison of the stone with the animal in
the following manner. The thoughts here mentioned should <span class="t5 hoverable">pass</span> through
his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> accompanied by vivid feelings, and no other thought, no other
feeling, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> mingle with them and disturb what should be an intensely
attentive observation. The student <span class="t1 t7 t9 t14 t15 t17 t25 t28 hoverable">says</span> to himself: “The stone has a form;
the animal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> has a form. The stone remains motionless in its place. The

28

animal changes its place. It is instinct (desire) which causes the animal to
change its place. Instincts, too, are served by the <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of the animal. Its
organs and limbs are fashioned in accordance with these instincts. The
<span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of the stone is not fashioned in accordance with desires, but in
accordance with desireless force.” (The fact here mentioned, in its bearing
on the contemplation of crystals, is in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> ways distorted by those who
have only heard of it in an outward, exoteric manner, and in this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> such
practices as crystal-gazing have their origin Such manipulations are based
on a misunderstanding. They have been described in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> books, but they
<span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> the subject of genuine esoteric teaching.)
By sinking deeply into such thoughts, and while doing so, observing the
stone and the animal with rapt attention, there arise in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> quite
separate kinds of feelings. From the stone there flows into the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span>
kind of feeling, and from the animal the other kind. The attempt will
probably not succeed at first, but little by little, with genuine and patient
practice, these feelings ensue. Only, this exercise <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> be practiced over
and over again. At <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> the feelings are only present as <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> as the
observation lasts. Later on they continue, and then they grow to something
which remains living in the soul. The student has then but to reflect, and
both feelings will always arise, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> the contemplation of an
external object. Out of these feelings and the thoughts that are bound up
with them, the organs of clairvoyance are formed. If the plant should then
be included in this observation, it will be noticed that the feeling flowing
from it lies between the feelings derived from the stone and the animal, in
both quality and degree. The organs <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> formed are <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> eyes. The

noted that the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">words</span> “dark” and “light,” as <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t8 t10 t12 t13 t14 t17 t19 t23 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> as the other expressions
used, only approximately describe what is meant. This <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">cannot</span> be
otherwise if ordinary language is used, for this language was created to
suit physical conditions. <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">Spiritual</span> science describes that which, for
clairvoyant organs, flows from the stone, as blue, or blue-red; and that
which is felt as coming from the animal as red or red-yellow. In reality,
colors of a <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> kind are seen. The color proceeding the plant is green
which little by little turns into a <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> ethereal pink. The plant is actually
that product of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> which in higher worlds resembles, in <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span>
respects, its constitution in the physical world. The same does not apply to
the stone and the animal. It <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> now be clearly understood that the
above-mentioned colors only represent the principal shades in the stone,
plant and animal kingdom. In reality, all possible intermediate shades are
present. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Every</span> stone, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> plant, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> animal has its own particular
shade of color. In addition to these there are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> the beings of the higher
worlds who <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> incarnate physically, but who have their colors, often

29

wonderful, often horrible. Indeed, the wealth of color in these higher
worlds is immeasurably greater than in the physical world.
Once the faculty of seeing with <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> eyes has been acquired, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> then
encounters sooner or later the beings here mentioned, some of them
higher, some lower than <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> himself--beings that <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> enter physical
reality.
If this point has been reached, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> to a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> deal lies open. But it is
inadvisable to proceed further <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> paying careful heed to what is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span>
or otherwise imparted by the <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> researcher. And for that, too, which
has been described, attention paid to such experienced guidance is the very
best thing. Moreover, if a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> has the strength and the endurance to travel
so <span class="t6 t9 t18 t26 hoverable">far</span> that he fulfills the elementary conditions of enlightenment, he will
assuredly seek and find the <span class="t27 hoverable">right</span> guidance.
But in any circumstances, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> precaution is necessary, failing which it
were better to leave untrodden all steps on the path to higher knowledge. It

of seed will appear as if enveloped in a small luminous cloud. In a
sensible-supersensible way, it will be felt as a kind of flame. The center of
this flame evokes the same feeling that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> has when under the impression

It is not surprising that all this appears to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> as illusion. “What is the

point: not to confuse <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> reality with imagination at this difficult

onward and not <span class="t8 t13 hoverable">become</span> timorous and faint-hearted. On the other hand,

Out of the plant there again grows a kind of <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> flame-form, which is,

experienced when the physical eye rests on the color blue. This fact <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span>
be noted by all who intend to rise to <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> perception. Otherwise they
will expect a mere repetition of the physical in the spiritual. This <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span>

things. It is for this reason that the initiates speak a <span class="t1 t2 t18 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">different</span> language
from the uninitiated, for the former <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">know</span> the names by which the beings

III
Initiation
Initiation is the <span class="t6 t9 t22 t29 hoverable">highest</span> stage in an esoteric training concerning which it is
possible to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> some indications in a <span class="t25 hoverable">book</span> intended for the genuine
public. Whatever lives beyond forms a subject difficult to understand, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span>
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> to it can be <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> by all who have passed through preparation,
enlightenment, and initiation as <span class="t6 t9 t18 t26 hoverable">far</span> as the lesser mysteries.
The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> and proficiency conferred by initiation <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">cannot</span> be obtained
in any other manner, except in some <span class="t6 t9 t18 t26 hoverable">far</span> distant future, after <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span>
incarnations, by quite <span class="t1 t2 t18 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">different</span> <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t14 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">means</span> and in quite a <span class="t1 t2 t18 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">different</span> form. The
initiate of today undergoes experiences which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> otherwise <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> to
him <span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">much</span> later, under quite <span class="t1 t2 t18 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">different</span> circumstances.
The secrets of existence are only accessible to an extent corresponding to
man's own degree of maturity. For this reason alone the path to the higher
stages of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> and <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> is beset with obstacles. A firearm should
not be <span class="t27 hoverable">used</span> until sufficient experience has been gained to avoid disaster,
caused by its use. A <span class="t9 hoverable">person</span> initiated today <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> further ado <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> lack
the experience which he will gain during his future incarnations before he

At the portal of initiation, therefore, this experience <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> be supplied in
some other way. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> instructions <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> to the candidate for
initiation serve as a substitute for these future experiences. These are the
so-called trials, which he has to undergo, and which constitute a normal
course of inner development resulting from due application to such
exercises as are described in the preceding chapters.
These trials are often discussed in books, but it is only natural that such
discussions should as a rule <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> quite false impressions of their nature;

The would-be initiate <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> into contact with <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> and facts
belonging to the higher worlds, but he can only <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> and hear them if his
feeling is ripe for the perception of the <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> forms, colors and tones
described in the chapters on Preparation and Enlightenment.
The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> trial consists in obtaining a truer vision than the average <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> has

knowledge, for it is a question not of science but of vision. As a rule, the
would-be initiate proceeds to learn how the objects of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> and the

before the beholder. The qualities which can then be seen and heard are
hidden from the physical eyes and ears. For physical perception they are
concealed as if by a veil, and the falling <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">away</span> of this veil for the would-be

of initiation through the Fire-Trial. Such <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> have passed through a
wealth of experience, so that their self-confidence, courage and fortitude
have been greatly strengthened in a normal manner while learning to bear
sorrow, disappointment and failure in their undertakings with greatness of
soul, and especially with equanimity and unbroken strength. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> they are

curiosity of the candidate. It is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> that he learns <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> uncommon <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span>

perseverance such as cannot, as a rule, be acquired in the lower world.
The candidate <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> always turn back after the fire-trial. He will then
resume his life, strengthened in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> and soul, and wait for a future
incarnation to continue his initiation. In his present incarnation he will
prove himself a more useful member of society and of humanity than he
was before. In whatever position he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> find himself, his firmness,
prudence, resoluteness, and his beneficent influence over his fellows will
have greatly increased.
But if, after completing the fire-trial, he should wish to continue the path,
a <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> writing-system generally adopted in esoteric training <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> now
be revealed to him. The actual teachings manifest themselves in this
writing, because the hidden (occult) qualities of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">cannot</span> be directly

translate the teachings into ordinary language as best they can. The occult
script reveals itself to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> when the latter has attained <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span>

time. It <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">cannot</span> be learned as an artificial writing is learned and read. The
candidate grows into clairvoyant <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> in an appropriate way, and
during this growth in a <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> strength is developed in his soul, as a <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span>

trial, <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t18 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">might</span> possibly awaken in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> of its own accord, as the

41

soul continually develops, but it will be <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> safer to follow the
instructions of those who are spiritually experienced, and who have some
proficiency in deciphering the occult script.
The signs of the occult script are not arbitrarily invented; they correspond
to the forces actively engaged in the world. They teach us the language of
things. It becomes immediately apparent to the candidate that the signs he

reasons here not to be discussed, gifts have been bestowed on them which

contrary, all the qualities which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> a <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> being capable and efficient
are enhanced in the student to a degree incomprehensible to the
uninitiated. If, in the eyes of the uninitiated, this does not always appear to
be the case, it is simply because he often lacks the ability to judge the
initiate correctly. The deeds of the latter are not always intelligible to the
former. But this only happens in special cases.
At this stage of initiation there are duties to be performed for which no
outward stimulus is given. The candidate will not be moved to action by
external pressure, but only through adherence to the rules of conduct
revealed to him in the occult script. He <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> now show in this <span class="t6 hoverable">second</span> trial
that, led by such rules, he can act with the same firmness and precision
with which, for instance, an official performs the duties that belong to
him. For this purpose, and in the course of his further training, he will find
himself faced by a <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> definite task. He <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> perform some action in
consequence of observations <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> on the basis of what he has learned
during preparation and enlightenment. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of this action can be

he recognizes his duty and acts rightly, his trial has been successful. The
success can be recognized in the alteration produced by his action in the
figures, colors, and tones apprehended by his <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> eyes and ears. Exact
indications are given, as the training progresses, showing how these
figures appear and are experienced after the action has been performed,
and the candidate <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">know</span> how to produce this change. This trial is
<span class="t6 t10 t15 hoverable">known</span> as the Water-Trial, because in his activity in these higher worlds
the candidate is deprived of the support derived from outward
circumstances, as a swimmer is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> support when swimming in <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span>
that is beyond his depth. This activity <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> be repeated until the candidate
attains absolute poise and assurance.
The importance of this trial lies again in the acquisition of a quality.
Through his experiences in the higher worlds, the candidate develops this
quality in a short <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> to such a high degree that he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> otherwise have

around the fact that he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> be guided only by the results of his higher

in question in these higher regions of existence. Should he, in the course
of his activity, introduce any of his own opinions and desires, or should he

diverge for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> moment from the laws which he has recognized to be

something quite different. He acquires this fine quality with regard to

perceive the new. Had we not gone through a definite experience we
should perhaps be blind to the qualities of the object or being that comes

Some Practical Aspects
The training of thoughts and feelings, pursued in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> described in the
chapters on Preparation, Enlightenment, and Initiation, introduces into the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t3 t5 t7 t8 t13 t16 t18 t20 t21 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> the same organic symmetry with which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> has
constructed the physical body. Before this development, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t3 t5 t7 t8 t13 t16 t18 t20 t21 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> are
undifferentiated masses. The clairvoyant perceives them as interlacing,
rotating, cloud-like spirals, dully glimmering in reddish, reddish-brown, or
reddish-yellow tones. After this training they begin to assume a brilliant
yellowish-green, or greenish-blue color, and show a regular structure. This
inner regularity leading to higher knowledge, is attained when the student
introduces into his thoughts and feelings the same orderly system with
which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> has endowed his bodily organs that enable him to see, hear,
digest, breath, speak. Gradually he learns to breath and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> with this soul,
to speak and hear with the spirit.
In the following pages some practical aspects of the higher education of
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t3 t5 t7 t8 t13 t16 t18 t20 t21 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> will be treated in greater detail. They are such that anyone
can <span class="t0 t2 t16 t18 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">put</span> them into practice regardless of other rules, and thereby be led
some distance further into <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> science.
A particular effort <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> to cultivate the quality of patience. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Every</span>
symptom of impatience produces a paralyzing, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> a destructive effect on
the higher faculties that slumber in us. We <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> not expect an

should assuredly be disappointed. Contentment with the smallest fragment

the soul. It is quite understandable that the student should await results
with impatience; but he will achieve <span class="t15 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">nothing</span> so <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> as he fails to <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">master</span>
this impatience. Nor is it of any use to combat this impatience merely in
the ordinary sense, for it will <span class="t8 t13 hoverable">become</span> only that <span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">much</span> stronger. We overlook it in self-deception while it plants itself all the more firmly in the
depths of the soul. It is only when we <span class="t29 hoverable">ever</span> and again surrender ourselves
to a <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> definite thought, making it absolutely our own, that any results
can be attained. This <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> is as follows: I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> certainly do everything I

enlightenment. If this <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> becomes so powerful in the student that it
grows into an actual feature of his character, he is treading the <span class="t27 hoverable">right</span> path.
This feature soon sets its mark on his exterior. The gaze of his eye
becomes steady, the movement of his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> becomes sure, his decisions

disappears. Rules that appear trifling and insignificant <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> be <span class="t19 hoverable">taken</span> into
account. For example, supposing someone affronts us. Before our training
48

we should have directed our resentment against the offender; a wave of
anger <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have surged up <span class="t5 t7 hoverable">within</span> us. In a similar case, however, the
<span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> is immediately present in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> of the student that such an
affront makes no difference to his intrinsic worth. And he does whatever

<span class="t0 t1 t3 t5 t7 t8 t13 t16 t18 t20 t21 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> of anger. Of course it is not a case of simply accepting <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> affront,

Patience has the effect of attraction, impatience the effect of repulsion on
the treasures of higher knowledge. In the higher regions of existence
<span class="t15 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">nothing</span> can be attained by haste and unrest. Above all things, desire and
craving <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> be silenced, for these are qualities of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> before which

wishes to have it for his own sake, he will <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> attain it. This requires
him to be honest with himself in his innermost soul. He <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> in no case be
under any illusion concerning his own self. With a feeling of inner <span class="t3 t7 t9 t10 t15 t19 t22 hoverable">truth</span> he

moment he tries to excuse to himself any of his weaknesses, he has placed

can only be removed by self-enlightenment. There is only <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> to get
rid of faults and failings, and that is by a clear recognition of them.

of course, difficult, for the temptation to self-deception is immeasurably
great. Anyone making a habit of being truthful with himself opens the
portal leading to a deeper insight.
All curiosity <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> fall <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">away</span> from the student.

gratifying a selfish thirst for knowledge. He <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> only ask when

Nevertheless, his delight in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> and his devotion to it should in no

now ennobled and purified, will enable him to do so.
It is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> no use saying: I particularly wish to examine my previous life,

If we <span class="t8 t13 hoverable">become</span> angered, vexed or annoyed, we erect a wall around

The Conditions of Esoteric Training
The conditions attached to esoteric training are not arbitrary. They are the
natural outcome of esoteric knowledge. Just as no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> can <span class="t8 t13 hoverable">become</span> a
painter who refuses to handle a paint-brush, so, too, no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> can receive
esoteric training who is unwilling to meet the demands considered
necessary by the teacher. In the main, the latter can <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> <span class="t15 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">nothing</span> but
advice, and everything he <span class="t1 t7 t9 t14 t15 t17 t25 t28 hoverable">says</span> should be accepted in this sense. He has
already passed through the preparatory stages leading to a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of
the higher worlds, and knows from experience what is necessary. It
depends entirely <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the free-will of each individual <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> being
whether or not he choose to tread the same path. To insist on being
admitted to esoteric training <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> fulfilling the conditions <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be
equivalent to saying: “Teach me how to paint, but do not ask me to handle
a paint-brush.” The teacher can <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> offer anything unless the recipient
comes forward to meet him of his own free-will. But it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> be
emphasized that a general desire for higher <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> is not sufficient.
This desire will, of course, be felt by many, but <span class="t15 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">nothing</span> can be achieved
by it alone so <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> as the special conditions attached to esoteric training
are not accepted. This point should be considered by those who complain
that the training is difficult. Failure or unwillingness to fulfill these strict
conditions <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> entail the abandonment of esoteric training, for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span>
being. It is true, the conditions are strict, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> they are not harsh, since their
fulfillment not only should be, but indeed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> be a voluntary action.
If this fact be overlooked, esoteric training can easily appear in the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> of
a coercion of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> or the conscience; for the training is based on the
development of the inner life, and the teacher <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> necessarily <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> advice
concerning this inner life. But there is no question of compulsion when a
demand is met out of free choice. To ask of the teacher: “Give me your
higher knowledge, but leave me my customary emotions, feelings, and
thoughts,” <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be an impossible demand. In this case the gratification of

pursued in such a spirit, however, higher <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> can <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> be attained.

should be emphasized that the complete fulfillment of any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of these
conditions is not insisted upon, but only the corresponding effort. No <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span>

is the effort of will that matters, and the ready disposition to enter <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span>

the advancement of bodily and <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> health. Of course,

health does not depend, in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> instance, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the

rejected, but it is demanded of the student that he should
have the will to lead a healthy life. In this respect he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span>

more a question of warding off harmful influences than of

stand higher, as <span class="t6 t9 t18 t26 hoverable">far</span> as the student is concerned. For him
pleasure can only be a <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t14 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">means</span> to health and to life, and in
this connection we must, above all, be honest and truthful
with ourselves. There is no use in leading an ascetic <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span>

possible, whatever his position, to further the health of

the striving for complete health of mind. An unhealthy <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span>

<span class="t15 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">Nothing</span> should be further removed from the student than
an inclination toward a fantastical, excitable life, toward
nervousness, exaggeration, and fanaticism. He should

acquire a healthy outlook on all circumstances of life; he
should meet the demands of lie with steady assurance,
quietly letting all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> their impression on him and

All one-sided and extravagant
tendencies in his sentiments and criticisms should be
avoided. Failing this, he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> find his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> merely into

2. The <span class="t6 hoverable">second</span> condition is that the student should feel
himself co-ordinated as a link in the <span class="t3 t5 t7 t9 t20 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> of life. <span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">Much</span> is

“Is my pupil's deficiency not the result of my own action?”
Instead of directing my feelings against him I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> rather

future be better able to satisfy my demands. Proceeding
from such an attitude, a change will <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> over the student's

the same pains with him they <span class="t4 hoverable">took</span> with me. I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> reflect
on the fact that something was <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> to me which was
withheld from him, that I enjoy my fortune precisely
because it was denied him. And then I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> naturally <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span>
to think of myself as a link in the <span class="t3 t5 t7 t9 t20 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> of humanity and a
sharer in the responsibility for everything that occurs. This
does not imply that such a <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> should be immediately
translated into external acts of agitation. It should be
cherished in stillness <span class="t5 t7 hoverable">within</span> the soul. Then quite gradually
it will <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t15 t17 t18 t19 hoverable">set</span> its mark on the outward demeanor of the student.
In such matters each can only begin by reforming himself.
It is of no avail, in the sense of the foregoing thoughts, to
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> general demands on the <span class="t3 t5 t7 t9 t20 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> of humanity. It is easy
to decide what <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> ought to be; but the student <span class="t9 t16 t26 hoverable">works</span> in

56

the depths, not on the surface. If <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> be quite
wrong to relate the demand here indicated with an external,
least of all political, demands; with such matters this
training can have <span class="t15 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">nothing</span> to do. Political agitators know, as
a rule, what to demand of other people; but they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">say</span> little of
demands on themselves.
3. This brings us to the third condition. The student <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span>
<span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t7 t10 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> upward to the realization that his thoughts
and feelings are as important for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> as his actions.
It <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> be realized that it is equally injurious to hate a
fellow-being as to strike him. The realization will then
follow that by perfecting ourselves we accomplish
something not only for ourselves, but for the <span class="t3 t5 t7 t9 t20 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> world.
The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> derives equal benefit from our untainted feelings
and thoughts as from our <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> demeanor, and as <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> as we
<span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">cannot</span> believe in this cosmic importance of our inner life,
we are unfit for the path that is here described. We are only
filled with the <span class="t27 hoverable">right</span> faith in the significance of our inner
self, of our soul, when we <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t7 t10 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> at it s <span class="t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> it were at
least as real as all external things. We <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> admit that our
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> feeling produces an effect, just as does <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> action
of our hand.
4. These <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">words</span> already express the fourth condition: to
acquire the conviction that the real being of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> does not
lie in his exterior but in his interior. Anyone regarding
himself as a product of the outer world, as a result of the
physical world, <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">cannot</span> succeed in this esoteric training, for
the feeling that we are beings of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t3 t5 t7 t8 t13 t16 t18 t20 t21 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> forms its
very basis. The acquisition of this feeling renders the
student fit to distinguish between inner duty and outward
success. He learns that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">cannot</span> be directly measured
by the other. He <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> find the proper mean between what is
indicated by external conditions and what he recognizes as
the <span class="t27 hoverable">right</span> conduct for himself. He should not force <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> his
environment anything for which it can have no
understanding, but <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> be quite free from the
desire to do only what can be appreciated by those around
him. The voice of his own <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> struggling honestly toward
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> <span class="t22 hoverable">bring</span> him the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> and only recognition of
the truths for which he stands. But he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> learn as <span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">much</span>
as he possibly can from his environment so as to discover
what those around him need, and what is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> for them. In
this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> he will develop <span class="t5 t7 hoverable">within</span> himself what is <span class="t6 t10 t15 hoverable">known</span> in
<span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> science as the “spiritual balance.” An open <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t16 t19 t22 t23 t25 t26 hoverable">heart</span>

for the needs of the outer <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> lies on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of the scales,
and inner fortitude and unfaltering endurance on the other.
5. This brings us to the fifth condition: steadfastness in
carrying out a resolution. <span class="t15 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">Nothing</span> should induce the
student to deviate from a resolution he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> have taken,
save only the perception that he was in error. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Every</span>
resolution is a force, and if this force does not produce an
immediate effect at the point to which it was applied, it
<span class="t9 t16 t26 hoverable">works</span> nevertheless on in its own way. Success is only
decisive when an action arises from desire. But all actions
arising from desire are worthless in relation to the higher
worlds. There, <span class="t7 hoverable">love</span> for an action is alone the decisive
factor. In this love, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> impulse that impels the student to
action should fulfill itself. Undismayed by failure, he will
<span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> grow weary of endeavoring repeatedly to translate
some resolution into action. And in this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> he reaches the
stage of not waiting to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> the outward effect of his actions,
but of contenting himself with performing them. He will
learn to <span class="t27 hoverable">sacrifice</span> his actions, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> his <span class="t3 t5 t7 t9 t20 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> being, to the
world, <span class="t27 t28 hoverable">however</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> receive his sacrifice.
Readiness for a sacrifice, for an offering such as this, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span>
be shown by all who <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> pursue the path of esoteric
training.
6. A sixth condition is the development of a feeling of
thankfulness for everything with which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> is favored. We

universe. How <span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">much</span> is needed to enable each <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of us to
receive and maintain his existence! How <span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">much</span> to we not
owe to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> and to our fellow <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> beings! Thoughts
such as these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> naturally to all who seek esoteric
training, for if the latter do not feel inclined to entertain
them, they will be incapable of developing <span class="t5 t7 hoverable">within</span>
themselves that all-embracing <span class="t7 hoverable">love</span> which is necessary for
the attainment of higher knowledge. <span class="t15 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">Nothing</span> can reveal
itself to us which we do not love. And <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> revelation

richer for it.
7. All these conditions <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> be united in a seventh: to
regard <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> unceasingly in the manner demanded by these

progress. And if in learning the student seeks straight thinking and sound
judgment, he need not stunt his devotion by doubts and suspicions.
We are not reduced to service subjection in listening to some information
with quiet devotion and because we do not at once oppose it with our own
opinion. Anyone having advanced some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> in the attainment of higher

but not to exact clairvoyance in the sense of <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> science.
The exercises described in the preceding chapters, if practiced in the <span class="t27 hoverable">right</span>
way, involve <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> changes in the organism of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> (astral body). The
latter is only perceptible to the clairvoyant, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be compared to a
cloud, psycho-spiritually luminous to a <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> degree, in the center of
which the physical <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> is discernible. (A description will be <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> in the
author's book, Theosophy.) In this astral <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> desires, lusts, passions, and
ideas <span class="t8 t13 hoverable">become</span> visible in a <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> way. Sensual appetites, for instance,
create the impression of a dark red radiance with a definite shape; a pure
and noble <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> finds its expression in a reddish-violet radiance; the
clear-cut concept of the logical thinker is experienced as a yellowish
figure with sharply defined outline; the confused <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> of the muddled
head appears as a figure with vague outline. The thoughts of a <span class="t9 hoverable">person</span> with
one-sided, queer views appear sharply outlined but immobile, while the
thoughts of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> accessible to the points of view of <span class="t1 t7 t13 hoverable">others</span> are seen to
have mobile, changeable outlines. (In all these and the following
descriptions it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> be noted that by seeing a color, <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> seeing is
meant. When the clairvoyant speaks of “seeing red,” he means: “I have an
experience, in a psycho-spiritual way, which is equivalent to the physical
experience when an impression of red is received.” This mode of
expression is here <span class="t27 hoverable">used</span> because it is perfectly natural to the clairvoyant. If
this point is over-looked, a mere color-vision <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> easily be mistaken for a
genuine clairvoyant experience.)
The further the student advances in his inner development, the more
regular will be the differentiation <span class="t5 t7 hoverable">within</span> his astral body. The latter is
confused and undifferentiated in the case of a <span class="t9 hoverable">person</span> of undeveloped inner

figure standing out distinctly from its environment. It extends from the
center of the head to the middle of the physical body, and appears <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> an
independent <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> possessing <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> organs. The organs now to be
considered are perceptible to the clairvoyant near the following <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of the
physical body: the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> between the eyes; the <span class="t6 hoverable">second</span> near the larynx; the
third in the region of the heart; the fourth in the so-called pit of the
stomach; the fifth and sixth are situated in the abdomen. These organs are
technically <span class="t6 t10 t15 hoverable">known</span> as wheels, chakrams, or lotus flowers. They are so
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> on account of their likeness to wheels or flowers, but of course it
should be clearly understood that such an expression is not to be applied
more literally than is the term “wings” when referring to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> halves of
the lungs. Just as there is no question of wings in the case of the lungs, so,
too, in the case of the lotus flowers the expression <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> be <span class="t19 hoverable">taken</span>
figuratively. In undeveloped persons these lotus flowers are dark in color,
motionless and inert. In the clairvoyant, however, they are luminous,
mobile, and of variegated color. Something of this kind applies to the
medium, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> in a <span class="t1 t2 t18 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">different</span> way; this question, however, need not be
pursued here any further.
Now, when the student begins his exercises, the lotus flowers <span class="t8 t13 hoverable">become</span>
more luminous; later on they begin to revolve. When this occurs,
clairvoyance begins. For these flowers are the sense-organs of the soul,
and their revolutions express the fact that the clairvoyant perceives
supersensibly. What was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> previously concerning <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> seeing
applies equally to these revolutions and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> to the lotus flowers
themselves. No <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> can perceive the supersensible until he has developed
his astral senses in this way. Thanks to the <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> organ situated in the
vicinity of the larynx, it becomes possible to survey clairvoyantly the
thoughts and mentality of other beings, and to obtain a deeper insight into
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> laws of natural phenomena. The organ situated near the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t16 t19 t22 t23 t25 t26 hoverable">heart</span>

other souls. When developed, this organ <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> makes it possible to observe
<span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> deeper forces in animals and plants. By <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t14 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">means</span> of the organ in the
so-called pit of the stomach, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> is acquired of the talents and
capacities of souls; by its means, too, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> played by animals, plants,
stones, metals, atmospheric phenomena and so on in the household of
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> becomes apparent.
The organ in the vicinity of the larynx has sixteen petals or spokes; the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span>
in the region of the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t16 t19 t22 t23 t25 t26 hoverable">heart</span> twelve, and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> in the pit of the stomach ten.
Now <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> activities of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> are connected with the development of
these organs, and anyone devoting himself to them in a <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> definite
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> contributes something to the development of the corresponding
organs. In the sixteen-petalled lotus, eight of its sixteen petals were

63

developed in the remote past during an earlier stage of <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> evolution.
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Man</span> himself contributed <span class="t15 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">nothing</span> to this development; he received them as
a gift from nature, at a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> when his consciousness was in a dull, dreamy
condition. At that stage of <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> evolution they were in active use, but
the manner of their activity was only compatible with that dull state of
consciousness. As consciousness became clearer and brighter, the petals
became obscured and ceased their activity. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Man</span> himself can now develop
the remaining eight petals by <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t14 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">means</span> of conscious exercises, and thereby
the <span class="t3 t5 t7 t9 t20 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> lotus flower becomes luminous and mobile. The acquisition of
<span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> faculties depends on the development of each <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of the sixteen
petals. Yet, as already shown, only eight can be consciously developed;
the remainder then appear of their own accord.
The development proceeds in the following manner. The student <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span>
apply himself with care and attention to <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> functions of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span>
hitherto exercised by him in a careless and inattentive manner. There are
eight such functions. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> in which ideas and conceptions
are acquired. In this respect <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> usually allow themselves to be led by
chance alone. They <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> or hear <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> thing or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">another</span> and <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> their ideas
accordingly. As <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> as this is the case the sixteen petals of the lotus
flower remain ineffective. It is only when the student begins to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">take</span> his
self-education in hand, in this respect, that the petals <span class="t8 t13 hoverable">become</span> effective. His
ideas and conceptions <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> be guarded; each single idea should acquire
significance fore him; he should <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> it in a definite message instructing
him concerning the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> of the outer world, and he should derive no
satisfaction from ideas devoid of such significance. He <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> govern his
mental <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> so that it becomes a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> mirror of the outer world, and direct
his effort to the exclusion of incorrect ideas from his soul.
The <span class="t6 hoverable">second</span> of these functions is concerned with the control of resolutions.
The student <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> not resolve <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> the most trifling act <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> wellfounded and thorough consideration. Thoughtless and meaningless actions
should be foreign to his nature. He should have well-considered grounds
for everything he does, and abstain from everything to which no
significant motive urges him.
The third function concerns speech. The student should utter no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">word</span> that
is devoid of sense and meaning; all talking for the sake of talking draws
him <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">away</span> from his path. He <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> avoid the usual kind of conversation,
with its promiscuous discussion of indiscriminately varied topics. This
does not imply his preclusion from intercourse with his fellows. It is
precisely in such intercourse that his conversation should develop to
significance. He is ready to converse with everyone, but he does so
thoughtfully and with thorough deliberation. He <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> speaks <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span>
grounds for what he says. He seeks to use <span class="t4 t18 t22 hoverable">neither</span> too <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> nor too few
words.

The fourth is the regulation of outward action. The student tries to adjust
his actions in such a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> that they harmonize with the actions of his
fellow-men and with the events in his environment. He refrains from
actions which are disturbing to <span class="t1 t7 t13 hoverable">others</span> and in conflict with his
surroundings. He seeks to adjust his actions so that they combine
harmoniously with his surroundings and with his position in life. When an
external motive causes him to act he considers how he can best respond.
When the impulse proceeds from himself he weighs with minute care the
effects of his activity.
The fifth function includes the management of the <span class="t3 t5 t7 t9 t20 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> of life. The
student endeavors to live in conformity with both <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> and spirit. <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">Never</span>
overhasty, he is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> indolent. Excessive activity and laziness are
equally alien to him. He looks <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> as a <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t14 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">means</span> for <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t7 t10 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> and disposes
it accordingly. He regulates his habits and the care of his health in such a
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> that a harmonious <span class="t3 t5 t7 t9 t20 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> is the outcome.
The sixth is concerned with <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> endeavor. The student tests his
capacities and proficiency, and conducts himself in the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> of such selfknowledge. He attempts <span class="t15 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">nothing</span> beyond his powers, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> seems to omit
<span class="t15 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">nothing</span> <span class="t5 t7 hoverable">within</span> their scope. On the other hand, he sets himself aims that
have to do with the ideals and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> duties of a <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> being. He does
not mechanically regard himself as a wheel in the vast machinery of
mankind but seeks to comprehend the tasks of his life, and to look out
beyond the limit of the daily and trivial. He endeavors to fulfill his
obligations <span class="t29 hoverable">ever</span> better and more perfectly.
The seventh deals with the effort to learn as <span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">much</span> from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> as possible.
<span class="t15 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">Nothing</span> passes before the student <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> giving him occasion to
accumulate experience which is of value to him for life. If he has
performed anything wrongly or imperfectly, he lets this be an incentive for
meeting the same contingency later on rightly and perfectly. When <span class="t1 t7 t13 hoverable">others</span>
act he observes them with the same <span class="t7 t10 t15 t25 hoverable">end</span> in view. He tries to gather a rich
store of experience, <span class="t29 hoverable">ever</span> returning to it for counsel; nor indeed will he
<span class="t29 hoverable">ever</span> do anything <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> looking back on experiences from which he can
derive help in his decisions and affairs.
Finally, the eighth is as follows: The student must, from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> to time,
glance introspectively into himself, sink back into himself, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">take</span> counsel
with himself, <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> and test the fundamental principles of his life, run over
in his thoughts the sum total of his knowledge, weigh his duties, and
reflect <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the content and aim of life. All these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> have been
mentioned in the preceding chapters; here they are merely recapitulated in
connection with the development of the sixteen-petalled lotus. By <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t14 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">means</span>
of these exercises the latter will <span class="t8 t13 hoverable">become</span> <span class="t29 hoverable">ever</span> more and more perfect, for it
is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> such exercises that the development of clairvoyance depends. The

65

better the student's thoughts and speech harmonize with the processes in
the outer world, the more quickly will he develop this faculty. Whoever
thinks and speaks what is contrary to <span class="t3 t7 t9 t10 t15 t19 t22 hoverable">truth</span> destroys something in the germ
of his sixteen-petalled lotus. Truthfulness, uprightness, and honesty are in
this connection creative forces, while mendacity, deceitfulness, and
dishonesty are destructive forces. The student <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> realize, however, that
actual deeds are needed, and not merely <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> intentions. If I think or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">say</span>
anything that does not conform with reality, I kill something in my

following <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> other instructions. But all such methods are rejected by
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> science, for they lead to the destruction of physical health

strengthen morally.
The distorted development of a lotus flower results not only in illusions
and fantastic conceptions, should a <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> degree of clairvoyance be
acquired, but <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> in errors and instability in ordinary life. Such a
development <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be the <span class="t1 t3 t9 t15 t20 t21 t26 t29 hoverable">cause</span> of timidity, envy, vanity, haughtiness,
willfulness and so on in a <span class="t9 hoverable">person</span> who hitherto was free from these defects.
It has already been explained that eight of the sixteen petals of this lotus
flower were developed in a remote past, and that these will re-appear of
themselves in the course of esoteric development. All the effort and
attention of the student <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> be devoted to the remaining eight. Faulty
training <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> easily result in the re-appearance of the earlier petals alone,
while the <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> petals remain stunted. This will ensue especially if too little
logical, rational thinking is employed in the training. It is of supreme
importance that the student should be a rational and clear-thinking person,
and of further importance that he should practice the greatest clarity of

speech. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">People</span> who begin to have some presentiment of supersensible

normal development. The less <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> talks about these matters the better.
Only someone who has achieved a <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> degree of clarity should speak
about them. At the beginning of their instruction, students are as a rule
astonishes at the teacher's lack of curiosity concerning their own
experiences. It <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be <span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">much</span> better for them to remain entirely silent on
this subject, and to content themselves with mentioning only whether they
have been successful or unsuccessful in performing the exercises and
observing the instructions <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> them. For the teacher has quite other
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t14 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">means</span> of estimating their progress than the students' own statements. The
eight petals now under consideration always <span class="t8 t13 hoverable">become</span> a little hardened
through such statements, whereas they should be kept soft and supple. The
following example taken, for the sake of clarity, not from the
supersensible <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> but from ordinary life, will illustrate this point.
Suppose I hear a piece of news and thereupon immediately <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> an
opinion. Shortly afterwards I receive some further news which does not
tally with the previous information. I am thereby obliged to reverse my
previous judgment. The result is an unfavorable influence <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> my
sixteen-petalled lotus. Quite the contrary <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have been the case had I,
in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> place, suspended judgment, and remained silent both inwardly
in <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> and outwardly in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">word</span> concerning the <span class="t3 t5 t7 t9 t20 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> affair, until I had
acquired reliable grounds for forming my judgment. Caution in the
formation and pronouncement of judgments becomes, by degrees, the
special characteristic of the student. On the other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t29 hoverable">hand</span> his receptivity for
impressions and experiences increases; he lets them <span class="t5 hoverable">pass</span> over him silently,
so as to collect and have the largest possible number of facts at his
disposal when the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> comes to <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> his opinions. Bluish-red and
reddish-pink shades color the lotus flower as the result of such
circumspection, whereas in the opposite case dark red and orange shades
appear. (Students will recognize in the conditions attached to the
development of the sixteen-petalled lotus the instructions <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> by the
<span class="t19 hoverable">Buddha</span> to his disciples for the Path. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> there is no question here of
teaching Buddhism, but of describing conditions governing development
which are the natural outcome of <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> science. The fact that these
conditions correspond with <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> teachings of the <span class="t19 hoverable">Buddha</span> is no reason
for not finding them <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> in themselves.)
The twelve-petalled lotus situated in the region of the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t16 t19 t22 t23 t25 t26 hoverable">heart</span> is developed in
a similar way. Half its petals, too, were already existent and in active use
in a remote stage of <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> evolution. Hence these six petals need not now
be especially developed in esoteric training; they appear of themselves and
begin to revolve when the student sets to <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t7 t10 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> on the other six. Here again
he learns to promote this development by consciously controlling and
directing <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> inner activities in a special way.

It <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> be clearly understood that the perceptions of each single organ of
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> or sprit bear a <span class="t1 t2 t18 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">different</span> character. The twelve and sixteen-petalled
lotus flowers transmit quite <span class="t1 t2 t18 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">different</span> perceptions. The latter perceives
forms. The thoughts and mentality of other beings and the laws governing
natural phenomena <span class="t8 t13 hoverable">become</span> manifest, through the sixteen-petalled lotus, as
figures, not rigid motionless figures but mobile forms filled with life. The
clairvoyant in whom this sense is developed can describe, for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> mode
of <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> and for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> <span class="t0 t8 t12 t15 t19 t23 t25 hoverable">law</span> of nature, a <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> which expresses them. A
revengeful thought, for example, assumes an arrow-like, pronged form,
while a kindly <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> is often formed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> an opening flower, and so on.
Clear-cut, significant thoughts are regular and symmetrical in form, while
confused thoughts have wavy outlines. Quite <span class="t1 t2 t18 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">different</span> perceptions are
received through the twelve-petalled lotus. These perceptions may, in a
sense, be likened to warmth and cold, as applied to the soul. A clairvoyant
equipped with this faculty feels this warmth and cold streaming out from
the forms discerned by the sixteen-petalled lotus. Had he developed the
sixteen and not the twelve-petalled lotus he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> only perceive, in the
kindly thought, for instance, the figure described above, while a
clairvoyant in whom both senses were developed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> notice what
can only be described as soul-warmth, flowing from the thought. It <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span>
be noted in passing that esoteric training <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> develops <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> organ <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span>
the other, so that the above-mentioned example <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be regarded as a
hypothetical case in behalf of clarity. The twelve-petalled lotus, when
developed, reveals to the clairvoyant a deep understanding of the
processes of nature. Rays of soul-warmth issue from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> manifestation
of growth and development, while everything in the process of decay,
destruction, ruin, gives an impression of cold.
The development of this sense <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be furthered in the following manner.
To begin with, the student endeavors to regulate his sequence of <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span>
(control of thought). Just as the sixteen-petalled lotus is developed by
cultivating thoughts that conform with <span class="t3 t7 t9 t10 t15 t19 t22 hoverable">truth</span> and are significant, so, too,
the twelve-petalled lotus is developed by inwardly controlling the trains of
thought. Thoughts that dart to and fro <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> will-o'-the-wisps and follow

destroy its form. The closer <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> to follow <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> thought, and
the more strictly everything of illogical <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> is avoided, the more
suitable will be the <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> this sense organ develops. If the student hears
illogical thoughts he immediately lets the <span class="t27 hoverable">right</span> thoughts <span class="t5 hoverable">pass</span> through his
mind. He should not, however, withdraw in a loveless <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> from what is
perhaps an illogical environment in <span class="t0 t6 t7 t8 t11 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">order</span> to further his own development.
<span class="t4 t18 t22 hoverable">Neither</span> should he feel himself impelled to correct all the illogical thoughts
expressed around him. He should rather silently co-ordinate the thoughts
as they pour in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> him, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> them conform to logic and sense, and

An equal consistency in his actions forms the <span class="t6 hoverable">second</span> requirement (control
of actions). All inconstancy, all disharmony of action, is baneful for the
lotus here in question. When the student performs some action he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span>
to it that his succeeding action follows in logical sequence, for if he acts
from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> with variable intent he will <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> develop the faculty here
considered.
The third requirement is the cultivation of endurance (perseverance). The
student is impervious to all influences which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> divert him from the
goal he has <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t15 t17 t18 t19 hoverable">set</span> himself, as <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> as he can regard it as the <span class="t27 hoverable">right</span> goal. For
him, obstacles contain a challenge that impels him to surmount them, but
<span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> a reason for giving up.
The fourth requirement is forbearance (tolerance) toward persons,
creatures, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> circumstances. The student suppresses all superfluous
criticism of everything that is imperfect, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> and bad, and seeks rather to
understand everything that comes under his notice. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Even</span> as the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t14 t23 t25 t28 hoverable">sun</span> does
not withdraw its <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> from the bad and the evil, so he, too, does not refuse
them an intelligent sympathy. Should some trouble befall him he does not
proceed to condemn and criticize, but accepts the inevitable, and
endeavors to the best of his ability to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> the matter a turn for the best. He
does not consider the opinions of <span class="t1 t7 t13 hoverable">others</span> merely from his own standpoint,
but seeks to <span class="t0 t2 t16 t18 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">put</span> himself into the other's position.
The fifth requirement is impartiality toward everything that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> brings. In
this connection we speak of faith and trust. The student meets <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span>
<span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> being and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> creature with this trust, and lets it inspire his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span>
action. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Upon</span> hearing some information, he <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> <span class="t1 t7 t9 t14 t15 t17 t25 t28 hoverable">says</span> to himself: “I don't
believe it; it contradicts my present opinions.” He is <span class="t6 t9 t18 t26 hoverable">far</span> rather ready to test
and rectify his views and opinions. He <span class="t29 hoverable">ever</span> remains receptive for
everything that confronts him, and he trusts in the efficacy of his
undertakings. Timidity and skepticism are banished from his being. He
harbors a faith in the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of his intentions. A hundred failures <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">cannot</span>
rob him of this faith. This is the “faith which can move mountains.”
The sixth requirement is the cultivation of a <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> inner balance
(equanimity). The student endeavors to retain his composure in the face of
joy and sorrow, and eradicates the tendency to fluctuate between the
seventh <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t15 t18 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heaven</span> of joy and the depths of despair. Misfortune and danger,
fortune and advancement alike find him ready armed.
The reader will recognize in the qualities here described the six attributes
which the candidate for initiation strives to acquire. The intention has been
to show their connection with the <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> organ <span class="t6 t10 t15 hoverable">known</span> as the twelvepetalled lotus flower. As before, special instructions can be <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> to <span class="t22 hoverable">bring</span>
this lotus flower to fruition, but here again the perfect symmetry of its

69

form depends on the development of the qualities mentioned, the neglect
of which results in this organ being formed into a caricature of its proper
shape. In this case, should a <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> clairvoyance be attained, the qualities
in question <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">take</span> an <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> instead of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> direction. A <span class="t9 hoverable">person</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span>
<span class="t8 t13 hoverable">become</span> intolerant, timid, or contentious toward his environment; may, for
instance, acquire some feeling for the sentiments of others, and for this
reason shun them or hate them. This <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> reach the point where, by
reason of the inner coldness that overwhelms him when he hears
repugnant opinions, he is unable to listen, or he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> behave in an
objectionable manner.
The development of this organ <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be accelerated if, in addition to all that
has been stated, <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> other injunctions are observed which can only be
imparted to the student by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">word</span> of mouth. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> the instructions <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span>
above do actually lead to genuine esoteric training, and more-over, the
regulation of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> described can be advantageous to all who

an effect <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the organism of the soul, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> slowly. As regards
the esoteric student, the observance of these principles is indispensable.
Should he attempt esoteric training <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> conforming to them, this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span>
only result in his entering the higher worlds with inadequate organs, and
instead of perceiving the <span class="t3 t7 t9 t10 t15 t19 t22 hoverable">truth</span> he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be subject to deceptions and
illusions. He <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> attain a <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> clairvoyance, but for the most part, be
the victim of greater blindness than before. Formerly he at least stood
firmly <span class="t5 t7 hoverable">within</span> the physical world; now he looks beyond this physical <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span>
and grows confused about it before acquiring a firm footing in a higher
world. All <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of distinguishing <span class="t3 t7 t9 t10 t15 t19 t22 hoverable">truth</span> from error <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> then perhaps

It is just for this reason
that patience is so necessary in these matters. It <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> <span class="t29 hoverable">ever</span> be borne in

is compatible with the willing readiness shown to develop the lotus
flowers to their regular shape. Should these flowers be <span class="t2 t4 t5 t22 t23 hoverable">brought</span> to fruition
before they have quietly attained their correct form, mere caricatures
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be the result. Their maturity can be <span class="t2 t4 t5 t22 t23 hoverable">brought</span> about by the special
instructions <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> in esoteric training, but their <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> is dependent on the
method of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> described above.
An inner training of a particularly intimate character is necessary for the
development of the ten-petalled lotus flower, for it is now a question of
learning consciously to control and dominate the sense-impressions
themselves. This is of particular importance in the initial stages of
clairvoyance, for it is only by this <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t14 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">means</span> that a source of countless
illusions and fancies is avoided. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">People</span> as a rule do not realize by what
factors their sudden ideas and memories are dominated, and how they are
produced. Consider the following case. Someone is traveling by railway;
his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> is busy with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> thought; suddenly is <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> diverges; he

recollects an experience that befell him <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span> ago and interweaves it with
his present thought. He did not notice that in looking through the window
he had caught sight of a <span class="t9 hoverable">person</span> who resembled <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">another</span> intimately

he did not actually read it, but his eyes unconsciously fell on the
announcement of the dangerous illness of the <span class="t9 hoverable">person</span> in question. He
remained unconscious of the impression he had received, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> this

and fantasy contained in such associations. It is just this source which

flower. Deeply hidden characteristics in other souls can be perceived by
this organ, but their <span class="t3 t7 t9 t10 t15 t19 t22 hoverable">truth</span> depends on the attainment of immunity from the
above-mentioned illusions. For this purpose it is necessary that the student
should control and dominate everything that seeks to influence him from
outside. He should reach the point of really receiving no impressions
beyond those he wishes to receive. This can only be achieved by the
development of a powerful inner life; by an effort of the will he only
allows such <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> to impress him to which his attention is directed, and he
actually evades all impressions to which he does not voluntarily respond.
If he sees something it is because he wills to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> it, and if he does not

The greater the energy and inner activity devoted to this work, the more
extensively will this faculty be attained. The student <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> avoid all

all unconscious impressions. In this connection the student <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> devote
special care to his thought-life. He singles out a particular <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> and
endeavors to link with it only such other thoughts as he can himself
consciously and voluntarily produce. He rejects all casual ideas and does
not connect this <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">another</span> until he has investigated the origin
of the latter. He goes still further. If, for instance, he feels a particular
antipathy for something, he will combat it and endeavor to establish a
conscious relation between himself and the thing in question. In this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span>

fewer. Only by such severe self-discipline can the ten-petalled lotus flower
attain its proper form. The student's inner <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> <span class="t8 t13 hoverable">become</span> a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of
attention, and he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> learn really to hold at a distance everything to
which he should not or does not wish to direct his attention.
If this strict self-discipline be accompanied by meditation as prescribed in
esoteric training, the lotus flower in the region of the pit of the stomach
comes to maturity in the <span class="t27 hoverable">right</span> way, and <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> and color of a <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> kind
are now added to the <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> and warmth perceptible to the organs described
above. The talents and faculties of other beings are thereby revealed, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span>

this stage of development, for the play of unconscious memories is here
exceedingly active. If this were not the case, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> possess
this inner sense, for it comes almost immediately into evidence when the
impressions delivered by the outer senses are held so completely under
control that they <span class="t8 t13 hoverable">become</span> dependent on <span class="t15 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">nothing</span> save attention or
inattention. This inner sense remains ineffective as <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> as the powerful
outer sense smother and benumb it.
Still greater difficulty attends the development of the six-petalled lotus
flower situated in the center of the body, for it can only be achieved as the
result of complete mastery and control of the <span class="t3 t5 t7 t9 t20 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> personality through
consciousness of self, so that body, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t3 t5 t7 t8 t13 t16 t18 t20 t21 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> harmonious

Nor
does it matter whether this desire proceeds from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> or the body. For
example, if a <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> stimulant be avoided for the purpose of selfpurification, this deprivation will only prove helpful if the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> suffers no

unattainable. Indeed, a renunciation of this kind contributes more toward
development than the opposite course.
The six-petalled lotus flower, when developed, permits intercourse with
beings of higher worlds, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> only when their existence is manifested in
the astral or soul-world. The development of this lotus flower, however, is
not advisable unless the student has <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> progress on that path of
esoteric development which enables him to raise his <span class="t0 t1 t3 t5 t7 t8 t13 t16 t18 t20 t21 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> into a still
higher world. This entry into the <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> proper <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> always run
parallel with the development of the lotus flowers, otherwise the student
will fall into error and confusion. He <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> undoubtedly be able to see,
but he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> remain incapable of forming a correct estimate of what he
saw. Now, the development of the six-petalled lotus flower itself provides
a <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> security against confusion and instability, for no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> can be
easily confused who has attained perfect equilibrium between sense (or
body), passion (or soul), and idea (or spirit). And yet, something more
than this security is required when, through the development of the sixpetalled lotus flower, living beings of independent existence are revealed
to his spirit, beings belonging to a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> so completely <span class="t1 t2 t18 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">different</span> from the

alone does not assure sufficient security in these higher worlds; still higher
organs are necessary. The latter will now be described before the
remaining lotus flowers and the further organization of the soul-body are
discussed. (This expression — soul-body — although obviously
contradictory when <span class="t19 hoverable">taken</span> literally, is <span class="t27 hoverable">used</span> because to clairvoyant
perception the impression received spiritually corresponds to the
impression received physically when the physical <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> is perceived.)
The development of the soul-body in the manner described above permits
perception in a supersensible world, but anyone wishing to find his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> in

The
mere mobility of the lotus flowers is not sufficient. The student <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span>

clairvoyant as a kind of double of the physical body, and forms to a <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span>
extent an intermediate step between the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> and the physical body.
(See the description on the author's <span class="t25 hoverable">book</span> Theosophy.) It is possible for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span>

exercise in attentiveness on a lower plane. Just as a <span class="t9 hoverable">person</span> can divert his
attention from something in front of him so that it becomes non-existent
for him, the clairvoyant can extinguish a physical <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> from his field of
observation so that it becomes physically transparent to him. If he exerts
this faculty in the case of some <span class="t9 hoverable">person</span> standing before him, there remains
visible to his clairvoyant sight only the etheric body, besides the soul-body
which is larger than the other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> — etheric and physical bodies — and
interpenetrates them both. The etheric <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> has approximately the size
and <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of the physical body, so that it practically fills the same space. It
is an extremely delicate and finely organized structure. (I beg the physicist
not to be disturbed at the expression “etheric body”. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">word</span> ether here

Its ground-color is <span class="t1 t2 t18 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">different</span> from any of the seven colors contained in the
rainbow. Anyone capable of observing it will find a color which is
actually non-existent for sense perception but to which the color of the
young peach-blossom <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be comparable. If desired, the etheric <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> can
be examined alone; for this purpose the soul-body <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> be extinguished
by an effort of attentiveness in the manner described above. Otherwise the
etheric <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> will present an <span class="t29 hoverable">ever</span> changing picture owing to its
interpenetration by the soul-body.
Now, the particles of the etheric <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> are in continual motion. Countless
currents stream through it in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> direction.

is beyond our jurisdiction, and this independence remains unaltered so
<span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> as we do not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">take</span> our development in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t29 hoverable">hand</span> in the sense of acquiring
supersensible faculties. For, at a <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> stage, development consists

74

precisely in adding to the unconscious currents and movements of the
etheric <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> <span class="t1 t7 t13 hoverable">others</span> that are consciously produced and controlled.
When esoteric development has progressed so <span class="t6 t9 t18 t26 hoverable">far</span> that the lotus flowers
begin to stir, <span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">much</span> has already been achieved by the student which can
result in the formation of <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> quite definite currents and movements in
his etheric body. The object of this development is the formation of a kind
of center in the region of the physical heart, from which radiate currents
and movements in the greatest possible variety of colors and forms. The
center is in reality not a mere point, but a most complicated structure, a
most wonderful organ. It glows and shimmers with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> shade of color
and displays forms of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> symmetry, capable of rapid transformation.
Other forms and streams of color radiate from this organ to the other parts
of the body, and beyond it to the astral body, completely penetrating and
illuminating it. The most important of these currents flow to the lotus
flowers. They permeate each petal and regulate its revolutions; then
streaming out at the points of the petals, they lose themselves in outer
space. The higher the development of a person, the greater the
circumference to which these rays extend.
The twelve-petalled lotus flower has a particularly close connection with
this central organ. The currents flow directly into it and through it,
proceeding on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> side to the sixteen and the two-petalled lotus
flowers, and on the other, the lower side, to the flowers of eight, six and
four petals. It is for this reason that the very greatest care <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> be devoted
to the development of the twelve-petalled lotus, for an imperfection in the
latter <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> result in irregular formation of the <span class="t3 t5 t7 t9 t20 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> structure. The above
will <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> an idea of the delicate and intimate <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of esoteric training,
and of the accuracy needed if the development is to be regular and correct.
It will <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> be evident beyond doubt that directions for the development of
supersensible faculties can only be the concern of those who have
themselves experienced everything which they propose to awaken in
others, and who are unquestionably in a position to <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">know</span> whether the

the directions that have been <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> him, he introduces into his etheric

consist of the above-mentioned and similar exercises in meditation and

The student <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> at <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> times <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">let</span> these instructions permeate his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span>

necessity for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> at the present stage of evolution. The clairvoyant <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span>

The center in the head, once duly fixed, is then moved lower down, to the
region of the larynx. This is effected by further exercises in concentration.
Then the currents of the etheric <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> radiate from this point and illumine
the astral space surrounding the individual.
Continued practice enables the student to determine for himself the
position of this etheric body. Hitherto this position depended <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span>
external forces proceeding from the physical body. Through further
development the student is able to turn his etheric <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> to all sides. This
faculty is effected by currents moving approximately along both hands and
centered in the two-petalled lotus in the region of the eyes. All this is
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> possible through the radiations from the larynx assuming round
forms, of which a number flow to the two-petalled lotus and thence <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span>
undulating currents along the hands. As a further development, these
currents branch out and ramify in the most delicate manner and become,
as it were, a kind of web which then encompasses the entire etheric <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span>

this membrane. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> the individual becomes sensitive to these external
streams; they <span class="t8 t13 hoverable">become</span> perceptible to him.
And now the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> has <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> the complete system of currents and
movements its center situated in the region of the heart. This again is
effected by persevering with the exercises in concentration and
meditation; and at this point <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> the stage is reached when the student

significance for him. They <span class="t8 t13 hoverable">become</span> as it were spiritually audible in their
innermost self, and speak to him of their essential being. The currents
described above <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> him in touch with the inner being of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> to

humanity have uttered. The sayings of the <span class="t19 hoverable">Buddha</span> and the Gospels, for

of our present evolutionary stage. For the esoteric student, however, they
<span class="t8 t13 hoverable">become</span> a force on which he gladly lets his inner senses rest, for they
correspond with <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> movements in the etheric body. Devotional
surrender to them, with perfect inner peace, creates an inner harmony with
these movements; and because the latter are an image of <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> cosmic
rhythms which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> at <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> points repeat themselves and revert to

In esoteric training there is question of four attributes which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> be
acquired on the so-called preparatory path for the attainment of higher
knowledge. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> is the faculty of discriminating in thoughts between
<span class="t3 t7 t9 t10 t15 t19 t22 hoverable">truth</span> and appearance or mere opinion. The <span class="t6 hoverable">second</span> attribute is the correct
estimation of what is inwardly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> and real, as against what is merely
apparent. The third rests in the practice of the six qualities already
mentioned in the preceding pages: thought-control, control of actions,
perseverance, tolerance, faith and equanimity. The fourth attribute is the
<span class="t7 hoverable">love</span> of inner freedom.
A mere intellectual understanding of what is included in these attributes is
of no value. They <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> be so incorporated into the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> that they <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> the
basis of inner habits. Consider, for instance, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> of these attributes:
The discrimination between <span class="t3 t7 t9 t10 t15 t19 t22 hoverable">truth</span> and appearance. The student <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> so
train himself that, as a matter of course, he distinguishes in everything that
confronts him between the non-essential elements and those that are
significant and essential. He will only succeed in this if, in his observation
of the outer world, he quietly and patiently <span class="t29 hoverable">ever</span> and again repeats the
attempt. And at the <span class="t7 t10 t15 t25 hoverable">end</span> he will naturally single out the essential and the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> at a glance, whereas formerly the non-essential, the transient, too,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> content him. “All that is transient is but a seeming” (“Alles
Vergänglich ist nur ein Gleichnis,” Goethe, Faust II. ) is a <span class="t3 t7 t9 t10 t15 t19 t22 hoverable">truth</span> which
becomes an unquestionable conviction of the soul. The same applies to the
remaining <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> of the four attributes mentioned.

Now these four inner habits do actually produce a transformation of the
delicate <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> etheric body. By the first, discrimination between <span class="t3 t7 t9 t10 t15 t19 t22 hoverable">truth</span> and
appearance, the center in the head already described is formed and the
center in the region of the larynx prepared. The actual development of
these centers is of course dependent on the exercises in concentration
described above; the latter <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> for development and the four attributes
<span class="t22 hoverable">bring</span> to fruition. Once the center in the larynx has been prepared, the free
control of the etheric <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> and its enclosure <span class="t5 t7 hoverable">within</span> a network covering, as
explained above, results from the correct estimation of what is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> as
against what is apparent and non-essential. If the student acquires this
faculty of estimation, the facts of the higher worlds will gradually <span class="t8 t13 hoverable">become</span>
perceptible to him. But he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> not think that he has to perform only such
actions which appear significant when judged by the standard of a mere
intellectual estimate. The most trifling action, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> little thing
accomplished, has something of importance in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> cosmic
household, and it is merely a question of being aware of this importance.
A correct estimation of the affairs of daily <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> is required, not an
underestimation of them. The six virtues of which the third attribute
consists have already been dealt with; they are connected with the
development of the twelve-petalled lotus in the region of the heart, and, as
already indicated, it is to this center that the life-currents of the etheric
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> be directed. The fourth attribute, the longing for liberation,
serves to <span class="t22 hoverable">bring</span> to fruition the etheric organ in the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t16 t19 t22 t23 t25 t26 hoverable">heart</span> region. Once this
attribute becomes an inner habit, the individual frees himself from
everything which depends only <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the faculties of his own personal
nature. He ceases to view <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> from his own separate standpoint, and the
boundaries of his own narrow <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">self</span> fettering him to this point of view
disappear. The secrets of the <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> gain access to his inner self.
This is liberation. For those fetters constrain the individual to regard tings
and beings in a manner corresponding to his own personal traits. It is from
this personal manner of regarding <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> that the student <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> <span class="t8 t13 hoverable">become</span>
liberated and free.
It will be clear from the above that the instructions <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> in esoteric
training exert a determining influence reaching the innermost depths of
<span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> nature. Such are the instructions regarding the four qualities
mentioned above. They can be <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">another</span> in all the

thoughts and feelings; in other respects it is produced by causes which are
beyond <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> influence.

influence. The student can convince himself that these forms proceed
<span class="t4 t18 t22 hoverable">neither</span> from minerals nor from artificial objects, nor, again, from plants or
animals. To gain complete understanding, he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> study those forms
which he can realize to have proceeded from the feelings, instincts, and
passions of <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> beings. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> he can find that these forms too are
influenced by his own thoughts and feelings, if only to a relatively small
extent. But there always remains a residuum of forms in this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span>
which such influences are negligible. Indeed, at the outset of this career
the student can perceive little beyond this residuum. He can only discover
its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> by observing himself. He then learns what forms he himself
produces, for his will, his wishes, and so on, are expressed in these forms.
An instinct that dwells in him, a desire that fills him, an intention that he

harbors, and so forth, are all manifested in these forms: his <span class="t3 t5 t7 t9 t20 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span>
character displays itself in this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> of forms. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> by his conscious
thoughts and feelings a <span class="t9 hoverable">person</span> can exercise an influence on all forms
which do not proceed from himself; but over those which he brings about
in the higher world, once he has created them. Now, it follows from what
has been <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> that on this higher plan man's inner <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of instincts, desires,

of the outer world. In a higher <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> man's inner being confronts him as a

At this stage of development the student has reached the point where he
can free himself from the illusion resulting from the initiation of his
personal self. He can now observe that inner <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">self</span> as outer world, just as he

he learns by gradual experience to deal with himself as hitherto he dealt
with the beings around him.

mean here in reality, 562. A sphere is perceived as <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> from its center.

forms or similar shapes that hurl themselves against the individual. In
reality, these passions are headed outward; they seek satisfaction in the
outer world, but this striving outward appears in the mirrored reflection as
an attack on the individual from whom they proceed.
If the student, before attaining insight into higher worlds, has learned by
quiet and sincere self-observation to realized the qualities and the defects

can refer the higher to something already <span class="t6 t10 t15 hoverable">known</span> to him, so that his point

his progress into higher worlds; and the reality to which these pictures
correspond is actually <span class="t5 t7 hoverable">within</span> himself. He should be <span class="t6 t9 t18 t26 hoverable">far</span> enough advanced
to refrain from desiring reality of a more robust kind at this initial stage,
and to regard these pictures as timely. He will soon meet something quite

the <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> ego becomes visible. Then threads are spun from the latter to

This is the moment when the two-petalled lotus in the region of the eyes is
required. If it now begins to stir, the student finds it possible to <span class="t22 hoverable">bring</span> his
higher ego in contact with higher <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> beings. The currents <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> this
lotus flower flow toward the higher realities in such a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> that the
movements in question are fully apparent to the individual. Just as the

<span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> beings of higher worlds.
Through inward application to the fundamental truths derived from
<span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> science the student learns to <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t15 t17 t18 t19 hoverable">set</span> in motion and then to direct the
currents proceeding <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> the lotus flower between the eyes.

<span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> beings and forms with them a united whole. He sees how the

in himself from the perishable; that is, he learns through personal insight
to understand the doctrine of the incarnation of the higher <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">self</span> in the

complex and that his qualities and destiny are due to this connection. He
learns to recognize the <span class="t0 t8 t12 t15 t19 t23 t25 hoverable">law</span> of his life, his karma. He realizes that his lower
self, constituting his present existence, is only <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of the forms which his

there are <span class="t1 t7 t13 hoverable">others</span> above him who have already traversed the stages which
still lie before him, and he realizes that the teachings and deeds of such
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> proceed from the inspiration of a higher world. He owes this

The socalled initiates of humanity now <span class="t8 t13 hoverable">become</span> vested with reality for him.
These, then, are the gifts which the student owes to his development at this
stage: insight into his higher self; insight into the doctrine of the
incarnation of this higher being in a lower; insight into the laws by which

None but those who have not penetrated to the depths of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>
religions can fail to recognize this fact. Personal insight into <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span>
reality explains the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> significance of these externally visible cults.
Religious service, then, becomes for the seer an image of his own
communion with the higher, <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> world.
It has been shown how the student, by attaining this stage, becomes in
<span class="t3 t7 t9 t10 t15 t19 t22 hoverable">truth</span> a <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> being. He can now mature to still higher faculties and, by
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t14 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">means</span> of the life-currents of his etheric body, control the higher and actual
life-element, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> attaining a high degree of independence from the
restrictions of the physical body.

VII
The Transformation of Dream <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Life</span>
An intimation that the student has reached or will soon reach the stage of
development described in the preceding <span class="t12 t19 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">chapter</span> will be <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> in the
change which comes over his dream life. His dreams, hitherto confused
and haphazard, now begin to assume a more regular character. Their
pictures begin to succeed each other in sensible connection, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> the
thoughts and ideas of daily life. He can discern in them law, cause, and
effect. The content, too, of his dreams is changed. While hitherto he
discerned only reminiscences of daily <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> and transformed impressions of
his surroundings or of his physical condition, there now appear before him
pictures of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> he has hitherto not known. At <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> the general
character of his dream <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> remains unchanged, in as <span class="t6 t9 t18 t26 hoverable">far</span> as dreams are
distinguished from waking mental activity by the symbolical presentation
of what they wish to express. No attentive observer of dream <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> can fail
to detect this characteristic. For instance, a <span class="t9 hoverable">person</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> dream that he has
caught some horrible creature, and he feels an unpleasant sensation in his
hand. He wakes to discover that he is tightly grasping a corner of the
blanket. The <span class="t3 t7 t9 t10 t15 t19 t22 hoverable">truth</span> is not presented to the mind, except through the medium
of a symbolical image. A <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> dream that he is flying from some
pursuer and is stricken with fear. On waking, he finds that he has been
suffering, during sleep, from palpitations of the heart. Disquieting dreams
can <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> be traced to indigestible food. Occurrences in the immediate
vicinity <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> reflect themselves symbolically in dreams. The striking
of a clock <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> evoke the picture of a troop of soldiers marching by to the
beat of drums. A falling chair <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be the occasion of a <span class="t3 t5 t7 t9 t20 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> dream
drama in which the sound of the fall is reproduced as the report of a gun,
and so forth. The more regulated dreams of esoteric students <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whose</span> etheric

expression, but they will cease merely to reflect reality connected with the
physical <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> and physical environment. As the dreams due to the latter
causes <span class="t8 t13 hoverable">become</span> more connected, they are mingled with similar pictures
expressing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> and events of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">another</span> world. These are the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span>
experiences lying beyond the range of waking consciousness.
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> mystic will <span class="t29 hoverable">ever</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> his experiences in dreams the basis of
any authoritative account of the higher world. Such dreams <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> be
merely considered as providing the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> hint of a higher development.
Very soon and as a further result, the student's dreams will no longer
remain beyond the reach of intellectual guidance as heretofore, but on the
contrary, will be mentally controlled and supervised <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> the impressions
and conceptions of waking consciousness. The difference between dream
and waking consciousness grows <span class="t29 hoverable">ever</span> smaller. The dreamer remains

84

awake in the fullest sense of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">word</span> during his dream life; that is, he is
aware of his mastery and control over his own vivid mental activity.
During our dreams we are actually in a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> other than that of our senses;
but with undeveloped <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> organs we can <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> none other than the
confused conceptions of it described above. It is only in so <span class="t6 t9 t18 t26 hoverable">far</span> present for
us as, for instance, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> of sense <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> be for a being equipped with
no more than rudimentary eyes. That is why we can <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> <span class="t15 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">nothing</span> in this

perceptible to us because our own <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> paints its daily experiences in

work-a-day <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> we lead a second, unconscious <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> in that other world. We
engrave in it all our thoughts and perceptions. These tracings only <span class="t8 t13 hoverable">become</span>
visible when the lotus flowers are developed. Now, in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> being
there are slender rudiments of these lotus flowers. We <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">cannot</span> perceive by

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> on them are very faint. We <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">cannot</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> the stars during the daytime
for a similar reason: their visibility is extinguished by the mighty glare of
the sun. Thus, too, the faint <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> impressions <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">cannot</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> themselves
felt in the face of the powerful impressions received through the senses.
Now, when the gate of the senses is closed during sleep, these other
impressions begin to emerge confusedly, and the dreamer becomes aware
of experiences in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">another</span> world. But as already explained, these
experiences consist at <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> merely of pictures engraved in the <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span>
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> by our mental activity attached to the physical senses. Only
developed lotus flowers <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> it possible for manifestations not derived
from the physical <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> to be imprinted in the same way. And then the
etheric body, when developed, brings full <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> concerning these
engraved impressions derived from other worlds.
This is the beginning of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> and activity in a <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> world, and at this point
esoteric training <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t15 t17 t18 t19 hoverable">set</span> the student a twofold task. To begin with, he
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> learn to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">take</span> stock of everything he observes in his dreams, exactly
as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> he were awake. Then, if successful in this, he is led to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> the
same observations during ordinary waking consciousness. He will so train
his attention and receptivity for these <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> impressions that they need
no longer vanish in the face of the physical impressions, but will always
be at <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t29 hoverable">hand</span> for him and reach him in addition to the others.
When the student has acquired this faculty there arises before his <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span>
eyes something of the picture described in the preceding chapter, and he
can henceforth discern all that the <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> contains as the <span class="t1 t3 t9 t15 t20 t21 t26 t29 hoverable">cause</span> of
the physical world. Above all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> he can perceive and gain <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span>

“I travel”; so, too, when an inwardly developed <span class="t9 hoverable">person</span> says: “I go through

Only this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> <span class="t8 t13 hoverable">become</span> a natural concept for him, so that he <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> for a
moment loses his firm footing in the physical world, or feels estranged
from it. If the student is to avoid becoming a fantastic visionary he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span>

to stir to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> the <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> perceptive force in the organ of the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t16 t19 t22 t23 t25 t26 hoverable">heart</span> and
control it through the currents described in the foregoing chapter. This
perceptive force is an element of higher sustainability, which proceeds
from the organ in question and flows with beautiful radiance through the
moving lotus flowers and the other channels of the developed etheric
body. Thence it radiates outward into the surrounding <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span>
rendering it spiritually visible, just as the sunlight falling on the objects of
the physical <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> renders them visible.
How this perceptive force in the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t16 t19 t22 t23 t25 t26 hoverable">heart</span> organ is created can only be
gradually understood in the course of actual development.
It is only when this organ of perception can be sent through the etheric
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> and into the outer world, to illumine the objects there, that the actual
<span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> world, as composed of objects and beings, can be clearly
perceived. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> it will be seen that complete consciousness of an object in
the <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> is only possible when <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> himself casts <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> it the
<span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> light. Now, the ego which creates this organ of perception does
not dwell within, but outside the physical body, as already shown. The
<span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t16 t19 t22 t23 t25 t26 hoverable">heart</span> organ is only the spot where the individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> kindles, from
without, this <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> organ. Were the latter kindled elsewhere, the
<span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> perceptions produced by it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have no connection with the
physical world. But all higher <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> realities <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> be related to the
physical world, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> himself <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> act as a channel through which they
flow into it. It is precisely through the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t16 t19 t22 t23 t25 t26 hoverable">heart</span> organ that the higher ego
governs the physical self, making it into its instrument.

be at a particular <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> of sense, and the surrounding objects
to be external to him. The spiritually developed <span class="t9 hoverable">person</span> feels himself to be
united with, and as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> in the interior of, the <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> objects he

no home at first. Should he, however, remain a mere wanderer he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span>
be unable to define any object in <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> space. Just as objects and places
in physical space are defined from a fixed point of departure, this, too,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> be the case in the other world.

physical life, too, a <span class="t9 hoverable">person</span> sees everything in terms of his physical home.
Natives of Berlin and Paris will involuntarily describe London in a
<span class="t1 t2 t18 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">different</span> way. And <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> there is a difference between the <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> and the
physical home. We are born into the latter <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> our co-operation and
instinctively absorb, during our childhood, a number of ideas by which
everything is henceforth involuntarily colored. The student, however,
himself founds his own <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> home in full consciousness. His
judgment, therefore, based on this <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> home, is formed in the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> of
freedom. This founding of a <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> home is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> in the language of
occult science the building of the hut.
<span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">Spiritual</span> vision at this stage extends to the <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> counterparts of the
physical world, so <span class="t6 t9 t18 t26 hoverable">far</span> as these exist in the so-called astral world. There
everything is <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> which in its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> is similar to <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> instincts,
feelings, desires, and passions. For powers related to all these <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span>
characteristics are associated with all physical objects. A crystal, for
instance, is cast in its <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> by powers which, seen from a higher
standpoint, appear as an active <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> impulse. Similar forces drive the
sap through the capillaries of the plant, <span class="t1 t3 t9 t15 t20 t21 t26 t29 hoverable">cause</span> the blossoms to unfold and
the seed vessels to burst. To developed <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> organs of perception all
these forces appear gifted with <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> and color, just as the objects of the
physical <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> have <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> and color for physical eyes. At this stage in his
development the student sees not only the crystal and the plant, but <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span>
the <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> forces mentioned above. Animal and <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> impulses are
perceptible to him not only through their physical manifestation in the
individual, but directly as objects; he perceives them just as he perceives
tables and chairs in the physical world. The <span class="t3 t5 t7 t9 t20 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> range of instincts,
impulses, desires and passions, both of an animal and of a <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> being,
constitute the astral cloud or aura in which the being is enveloped.
Furthermore, the clairvoyant can at this stage perceive <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> which are
almost or entirely withheld from the senses. He can, for instance, tell the

87

astral difference between a room full of low or of high-minded people.
Not only the physical but <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> the <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> atmosphere of a hospital differs
from that of a ballroom. A commercial town has a <span class="t1 t2 t18 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">different</span> astral air from
that of a university town. In the initial stages of clairvoyance this
perceptive faculty is but slightly developed; its relation to the objects in
question is similar to the relation of dream consciousness to waking
consciousness in ordinary life; it will, however, <span class="t8 t13 hoverable">become</span> fully awakened at
this stage as well.
The <span class="t6 t9 t22 t29 hoverable">highest</span> achievement of a clairvoyant who has attained the degree of
vision described above is that in which the astral counter-effects of animal
and <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> impulses and passions are revealed to him. A loving action is

hate. Senseless desire gives rise to an ugly astral counterpart, while a
feeling evoked by a high ideal creates <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> that is beautiful. These astral
images are but faintly perceptible during physical life, for their strength is
diminished by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> in the physical world. The desire for an object, for
example, produces a counterpart of this sort in addition to the semblance
of the desire itself in the astral world. If, however, the object be attained
and the desire satisfied, or if, at any rate, the possibility of satisfaction is
forthcoming, the corresponding image will show but faintly. It only attains
its full force after the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> of the individual <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> being, when the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span>

satisfy them, because the object and the physical organ are both lacking.
The gourmand, for instance, will still retain, after death, the desire to
please his palate; but there is no possibility of satisfying this desire
because he no longer has a palate. As a result, the desire produces an
especially powerful counterpart, by which the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> is tormented. These

The Continuity of Consciousness

conception be formed of the changes occurring in these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> conditions,

has been undertaken to attain this knowledge, <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> consciousness is
continually interrupted by the restful interval of sleep. During these
intervals the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> knows <span class="t15 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">nothing</span> of the outer world, and equally little of
itself. Only at <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> periods dreams emerge from the deep ocean of
insensibility, dreams linked to the occurrences of the outer <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> or the
conditions of the physical body. At first, dreams are only regarded as a
particular manifestation of sleep-life, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> only <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> states are
generally spoken of, namely, sleeping and waking. For <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> science,
however, dreams have an independent significance apart from the other

In the foregoing <span class="t12 t19 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">chapter</span> a description was <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> of the
alteration ensuing in the dream-life of the <span class="t9 hoverable">person</span> undertaking the ascent to
higher knowledge. His dreams lose their meaningless, irregular and
disconnected character and <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> themselves more and more into a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span>
of <span class="t0 t8 t12 t15 t19 t23 t25 hoverable">law</span> and order. With continued development, not only does this <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span>

representing a higher reality in the fullest sense of the word. Secrets and

are partly revealed to the student in the condition described above and
developed out of dream life, a condition, however, in which he by no
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t14 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">means</span> remains stationary.

develops this faculty of carrying over into waking consciousness the
condition he created for himself out of dream life. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> something <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> is

He now need no longer wait for his dreams to live in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">another</span> world, but he
can at any suitable moment <span class="t0 t2 t16 t18 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">put</span> himself into the above condition for the
purpose of higher perception. This condition then acquires a significance
for him similar to the perception, in ordinary life, of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> with active

Now this condition is only transitional to still higher stages of knowledge.
If the student continues his esoteric exercises he will find, in due time, that
the radical change, as described above, does not confine itself to his dream
life, but that this transformation <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> extends to what was previously a
condition of deep dreamless sleep. Isolated conscious experiences begin to
interrupt the complete insensibility of this deep sleep. Perceptions
previously unknown to him emerge from the pervading unknown to him
emerge from the pervading darkness of sleep. It is, of course, not easy to
describe these perceptions, for our language is only adapted to the physical
world, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> only approximate terms can be <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> to express what

experiences being exceedingly slight. The student knows very well, on
waking, that he has had an experience, but is completely in the dark as
regards its nature. The most important thing during this initial stage is to
remain quiet and composed, and not for a moment lapse into any unrest or
impatience. The latter is under all circumstances detrimental; it can <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span>
accelerate development, but only delays it. The student <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> cultivate a

awaited with patience and composure, remains a secure possession; while
should it appear momentarily in answer to forcible methods, it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be

Once this perceptive faculty is acquired and the experiences during sleep
are present to the student's consciousness in complete lucidity and clarity,
his attention should be directed to the following point. All these
experiences are seen to consist of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> kinds, which can be clearly
distinguished. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> kind will be totally <span class="t1 t2 t18 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">different</span> from anything that he
has <span class="t29 hoverable">ever</span> experienced. These experiences <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be a source of joy and
edification, but otherwise they should be left to themselves for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span>

connection existing between things; he seeks to grasp in <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> and idea
what his senses perceive. It is to these ideas and concepts that the
experiences during sleep refer. Obscure, shadowy concepts <span class="t8 t13 hoverable">become</span>
sonorous and living in a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> comparable only to the tones and the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">words</span>

the moment of birth is approaching for the liberated soul; for she has

from which, formerly, higher powers unknown to him influenced him.
These higher powers are directed by the universal cosmic harmony. The
student withdraws from this cosmic harmony, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> now himself

only arise if the student, through impatience or arrogance, assumes too

terror, a description of some of the so-called dangers will be given. It is
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> changes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">take</span> <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> in the student's finer bodies, as described
above. These changes are connected with <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> processes in the
development of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> fundamental forces of the soul, with willing,
feeling, and thinking. Before esoteric training, these forces are subject to a
connection ordained by higher cosmic laws. Man's willing, feeling and
thinking are not arbitrary. A particular idea arising in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> is attended
by a particular feeling, <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">according</span> to natural laws; or it is followed by a
resolution of the will in equally natural sequence. We enter a room, find it
stuffy, and open the window. We hear our <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> and follow the call.
We are questioned and we answer. We perceive an ill-smelling object and
experience a feeling of disgust. These are simple connections between
thinking, feeling, and willing. When we survey <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> we find that
everything is built up on such connections. Indeed, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> is not termed
normal unless such a connection, founded on the laws of <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> nature, is
observed between thinking, feeling and willing. It <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span>
contrary to these laws if the sight of an ill-smelling object gave anyone
pleasure, or if anyone, on being questioned, did not answer. The success
anticipated from a <span class="t27 hoverable">right</span> education or fitting instruction is based <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the
presumption that a connection between thinking, feeling, and willing,
corresponding to <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> nature, can be established in the pupil. <span class="t3 hoverable">Certain</span>
ideas are conveyed to him on the assumption that they will be associated,
in regular fashion, with his feelings and volitions.
All this arises from the fact that in the finer soul-vehicles of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> the

connected with each other <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">according</span> to laws. This connection in the finer

latter, too, the organs of will are connected <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">according</span> to laws with those of
thinking and feeling. A particular thought, therefore, inevitably evokes a
feeling or an activity of will. In the course of higher development, the
threads interconnecting the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> fundamental forces are severed. At <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span>
this severance occurs only <span class="t5 t7 hoverable">within</span> the finer <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> organism, but at a still
higher stage the separation extends <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> to the physical body. It is a fact
that in higher <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> development the brain divides into <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> separate

96

parts. This separation is not physically perceptible in the ordinary way, nor
can it be demonstrated by the keenest instruments. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> it occurs, and the
clairvoyant has <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t14 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">means</span> of observing it. The brain of the higher clairvoyant
divides into <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> independently active entities: The thought-brain, the
feeling-brain, and the will-brain.
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> the organs of thinking, feeling, and willing <span class="t8 t13 hoverable">become</span> individualized;
their connection henceforth is not maintained by laws inherent in
themselves, but <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> be managed by the awakened higher consciousness
of the individual. This, then, is the change which the student observes
coming over him: that no connection arises of itself between an idea and a
feeling or a will-impulse, unless he himself provides one. No impulse
urges him from <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> to action unless he himself in freedom <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> rise to
this impulse. He can henceforth confront, devoid of feeling, a fact which
before his training <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have filled him with glowing <span class="t7 hoverable">love</span> or bitter
hatred; and he can remain impassive at the <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> which formerly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span>
have spurred him on to action, as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> of its own accord. He can
perform actions through resolutions of the will for which there is not the
slightest reason for anyone not having undergone esoteric training. The
student's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> achievement is the attainment of complete mastery over the
combined activity of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> forces; but at the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> the
responsibility for this activity is placed entirely in his own hands.
It is only through this transformation of his being that the student can enter
consciously into relation with <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> supersensible forces and beings, for
his own <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> forces are related to <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> fundamental forces of the world.
The force, for instance, inherent in the will can affect definite <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> and
the beings of the higher worlds, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> perceive them; but it can only do
so when liberated from its connection with thinking and feeling <span class="t5 t7 hoverable">within</span> the
soul. The moment this connection is severed, the activity of the will can be
exteriorized. The same applies to the forces of thinking and feeling. A
feeling of hatred sent out by a <span class="t9 hoverable">person</span> is visible to the clairvoyant as a fine
luminous cloud of special coloring; and the clairvoyant can ward off this
feeling of hatred, just as an ordinary <span class="t9 hoverable">person</span> wards off a physical blow that
is aimed at him. In the supersensible world, hatred becomes a visible
phenomenon, but the clairvoyant can only perceive it in so <span class="t6 t9 t18 t26 hoverable">far</span> as he is able
to project outwards the force lying in his feeling, just as the ordinary
<span class="t9 hoverable">person</span> directs outwards the receptive faculty of his eye. And what is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span>
of hatred applies <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> to <span class="t6 t9 t18 t26 hoverable">far</span> more important phenomena of the physical
world. The student can enter into conscious intercourse with them, thanks
to the liberation of the fundamental forces of his soul.
Through the separation of the forces of thinking, feeling, and willing, the
possibility of a three-fold aberration arises for anyone neglecting the
injunctions <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> by esoteric science. Such an aberration can occur if the
connecting threads are severed before the higher consciousness is

97

sufficiently advanced to hold the reins and guide properly the separated
forces into free and harmoniously combined activity. For as a rule, the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> soul-forces are not equally advanced in their development at
any <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> period of life. In <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> person, thinking is ahead of feeling and
willing; in a second, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">another</span> soul-force has the upper <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t29 hoverable">hand</span> over its
companions. As <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> as the connection between the soul-forces is
maintained as established by higher cosmic laws, no injurious irregularity,
in a higher sense, can occur through the predominance of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> force or
another. Predominating will, for instance, is prevented by the leveling
influence of thinking and feeling from lapsing into any particular excesses.
When, however, a <span class="t9 hoverable">person</span> of such predominating will undertakes esoteric
training, feeling and thinking cease to exert their regular influence on the
will when the latter constantly presses on to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> exertions of <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> If,
then, such a <span class="t9 hoverable">person</span> is not sufficiently advanced to control completely the
higher consciousness and himself restore harmony, the will pursues its
own unbridled way, continually overpowering its possessor. Feeling and
<span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> lapse into complete impotence; the individual is scourged by his
over-mastering will. A violent <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> is the result, rushing from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span>
unbridled action to another.
A <span class="t6 hoverable">second</span> deviation occurs when feeling unduly shakes off its proper
control. A <span class="t9 hoverable">person</span> inclined to the revering of <span class="t1 t7 t13 hoverable">others</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> then diverge into
unlimited dependence, to the extent of losing all personal will and
thoughts. Instead of higher knowledge, the most pitiful vacuity and
feebleness <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> <span class="t8 t13 hoverable">become</span> such a person's lot. Or, in the case of such
inordinate predominance of the feeling life, a <span class="t9 hoverable">person</span> with an inclination
toward religious devotion can sink into the most degenerate welter.
The third <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> is <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> when <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> predominates, resulting in a
contemplative nature, hostile to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> and locked up <span class="t5 t7 hoverable">within</span> itself. The world,
for such people, has no further importance save that it provides them with
objects for satisfying their boundless thirst for wisdom. No <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> <span class="t29 hoverable">ever</span>
moves them to an action or a feeling. They appear everywhere as cold and
unfeeling creatures. They flee from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> contact with the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> of

exuberant violence of will, (2) sentimental emotionalism, and (3) cold,
loveless striving for wisdom. For outward observation, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> from the

hardly distinguishable (especially in degree) from an insane or, at least, a
highly neurasthenic person. Of course, the student <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> not resemble

The Guardian of the Threshold
The important experiences marking the student's ascent into the higher
worlds include his meeting with the Guardian of the Threshold. Strictly
speaking, there are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> Guardians: a lesser and a greater. The student
meets the lesser Guardian when the threads connecting willing, feeling,
and thinking <span class="t5 t7 hoverable">within</span> the finer astral and etheric bodies begin to loosen, in
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> described in the foregoing chapter. The greater Guardian is
encountered when this sundering of the connections extends to the
physical parts of the body, that is, at <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> to the brain. The lesser Guardian
is a sovereign being. He does not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> into existence, as <span class="t6 t9 t18 t26 hoverable">far</span> as the student
is concerned, until the latter has reached the requisite stage of
development. Only some of his most important characteristics can here be
indicated.
The attempt will now be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> to describe in narrative <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> this meeting
with the lesser Guardian of the Threshold, as a result of which the student
learns that his thinking, feeling, and willing have <span class="t8 t13 hoverable">become</span> released <span class="t5 t7 hoverable">within</span>
him from their inherent connection.
A truly terrible spectral being confronts him, and he will need all the
presence of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> and faith in the security of his path which he has had
ample opportunity to acquire in the course of his previous training.
The Guardian proclaims his signification somewhat in the following
words: “Hitherto, powers invisible to thyself watched over thee. They saw
to it that in the course of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thy</span> lives each of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thy</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> deeds <span class="t2 t4 t5 t22 t23 hoverable">brought</span> its

Thanks to their influence <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thy</span> character formed itself out of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thy</span> lifeexperiences and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thy</span> thoughts.

(It will be gathered from the above that the Guardian of the Threshold is
an (astral) figure, revealing itself to the student's awakened higher sight;
and it is to this supersensible encounter that <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> science conducts
him. It is a lower magical process to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> the Guardian of the Threshold
physically visible also. That was attained by producing a cloud of fine
substance, a kind of frankincense resulting from a particular mixture of a
number of substances. The developed <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of the magician is then able
to mould the frankincense into shape, animating it with the still
unredeemed karma of the individual. Such physical phenomena are no
longer necessary for those sufficiently prepared for the higher sight; and
besides this, anyone who sees, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> adequate preparation, his
unredeemed karma appear before his eyes as a living creature <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> run

novel <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> a description of the Guardian of the Threshold.)

of the student's own past life, his own character risen out of him into

independent existence. This awakening is <span class="t2 t4 t5 t22 t23 hoverable">brought</span> about by the separation
of will, thought, and feeling. To feel for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> has oneself

significance. The student's preparation <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> aim at enabling him to endure

these family group souls, racial spirits, and so on. It is <span class="t15 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">nothing</span> but the
<span class="t3 t7 t9 t10 t15 t19 t22 hoverable">truth</span> to say, for instance, that a national group <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> makes use of each

higher sense, it is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> an architect making use of workmen for executing
the details of a building. In the truest sense, everyone receives his allotted
task from his family, national, or racial group soul. Now, the ordinary

joins unconsciously in the tasks of his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> and of his race. From the
moment the student meets the Guardian, he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> not only <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">know</span> his own

extension of his horizon necessarily enlarges the scope of his duties. What
actually happens is that the student adds a <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> to his finer soul-body.
He puts on a <span class="t6 hoverable">second</span> garment. Hitherto he <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> through the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span>
with the coverings enveloping his personality; and what he had to
accomplish for his community, his nation, his race, was directed by higher
spirits who <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> use of his personality.

all such education in respect of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> now confronting him. For

again, it is more than a mere symbolical expression to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">say</span> that when the

where he stands a whirlwind which extinguishes all those <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> lights
that have hitherto illumined the pathway of his life. Utter darkness,
relieved only by the rays issuing from the Guardian himself, unfolds
before the student. And out of this darkness resounds the Guardian's
further admonition: “Step not across my Threshold until <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thou</span> dost clearly

now draws aside a veil which till now had concealed deep life-mysteries.
The family, national, and racial spirits are revealed to the student in their
full activity, so that he perceives clearly on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> hand, how he has
hitherto been led, and no less clearly on the other hand, that he will
henceforward no longer enjoy this guidance. That is the <span class="t6 hoverable">second</span> warning
received at the Threshold from its Guardian.
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Without</span> preparation, no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> endure the sight of what has here been
indicated. But the higher training which makes it possible at all for the
student to advance up to the Threshold simultaneously puts him in a
position to find the necessary strength at the <span class="t27 hoverable">right</span> moment. Indeed, the
training can be so harmonious in its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> that the entry into the higher

experience at the Threshold will then be attended by a premonition of that
felicity which is to provide the keynote of his newly awakened life. The
feeling of a <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> freedom will outweigh all other feelings; and attended by

Threshold by virtue of the fact that he becomes aware of confronting a
supersensible being whom he has himself <span class="t2 t4 t5 t22 t23 hoverable">brought</span> into existence, and

inclinations and habits, and he can <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> recognize the origin of <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span>

Appendix
The path to supersensible knowledge, as described in this book, leads the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> through experiences concerning the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of which it is especially
important to avoid all illusions and misconceptions. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> it is but natural
that the latter should arise in such questions as are here considered. In this
connection <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of the most serious mistakes occurs when the <span class="t3 t5 t7 t9 t20 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> range
of inner experience dealt with in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> science is distorted into
appearing in the same category as superstition, visionary dreaming,
mediumship (spiritism), and other degenerate practices. This distortion is
often due to the fact that persons desirous of following the path described
in this <span class="t25 hoverable">book</span> are confused with <span class="t1 t7 t13 hoverable">others</span> who in their search for supersensible
reality, and as a result of methods foreign to genuine striving for
knowledge, wander into undesirable paths. The experiences through which
the <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> lives on the path here described are wholly confined to the
realm of psycho-spiritual experience. They are only possible if equal
freedom and independence from the bodily <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> are attained for <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span>
other inner experiences, as is the case during ordinary consciousness,
when thoughts are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> concerning <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> outwardly perceived or
inwardly felt and willed, thoughts which do not themselves originate in
what is perceived, felt, and willed. There are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> who deny the
existence of such thoughts. They believe that no <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> is possible that is
not extracted from perceptions or from the inner <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> dependent on the
body. For them, all thoughts are to a <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> extent mere reflections of
perceptions and of inner experiences. This view, however, can be
expressed only by those who have <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> raised themselves to the faculty
of experiencing with their souls a self-sustaining <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> in pure thought. For
others, who have lived through this experience, it is a matter of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span>
that wherever <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> dominates the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> to the degree that this
<span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> permeates other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> functions, the <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> being is involved in an
activity in <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whose</span> origin his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> has no share. In the ordinary <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of the
soul, <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> is almost always mixed with other functions: perception,
feeling, willing and so forth. These other functions are effectuated by the
body; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> plays into them, and to the degree that is does this a
process takes place, in and through the <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> being, in which his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span>
has no share. This can only be denied so <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> as the illusion is not
discarded which arises from observing <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> only when the latter is
united with other functions. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> an inner exertion is possible which will
enable the thinking <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of inner <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> to be experienced as distinct from
everything else. Something consisting in pure <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> alone can be
detached from the encompassing soul-life, that is, thoughts that are selfsustaining and from which everything provided by perception or bodily
conditioned inner <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> is excluded. Such thoughts reveal themselves
through themselves, through what they are, as <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> supersensible
substance. Anyone uniting himself with them, while excluding all
perception, all memory, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> other token of inner life, knows himself

to be in a supersensible region and experiences himself outside the
physical body. For anyone familiar with this <span class="t3 t5 t7 t9 t20 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> process, the question
can no longer arise: Can the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> live through experiences outside the

For it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> mean denying what he knows
from experience. The only question for him is: What prevents such a
positive fact from being recognized? And the answer he finds to this
question is that the fact does not reveal itself unless the student <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span>

this revelation.
Now, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> <span class="t8 t13 hoverable">become</span> at once suspicious when an activity confined entirely

themselves should reveal itself. They believe that they themselves <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> the
revelation its content because they prepare themselves to receive it. They
expect experiences to which they contribute <span class="t15 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">nothing</span> and which allow them
to remain quite passive. Should such people, in addition, be ignorant of the
simplest scientific requirements for the comprehension of a <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> fact,

contents and productions of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> in which the soul's conscious
participation is reduced below the level maintained in sense-perception
and will-impelled action. Such are the soul-contents provided by the
experiences and revelations of the visionary and the medium. But what
comes to the fore through such revelations is not a supersensible but a
sub-sensible world. <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Human</span> waking <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> does not run its course completely

his bodily organization in the functions of sense perception and willing. In

independent of his body. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> the content and productions of his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> are
merely revelations of his bodily life. The experiences of the visionary and
the phenomena produced by the medium owe their existence to the fact
that a <span class="t9 hoverable">person</span> while <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> experiencing and producing is, with his soul, less

experience of the supersensible as indicated in this book, the development
of soul-life proceeds in just the opposite direction from that <span class="t19 hoverable">taken</span> by the

visionary and the medium. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> acquires a progressively greater

same independence realized in the experience of pure <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> is attained
by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> for a <span class="t6 t9 t18 t26 hoverable">far</span> wider range of activity.
For the supersensible activity of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> here meant, it is especially

supersensible activity of the soul, but <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> in which <span class="t15 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">nothing</span> supersensible

descriptions of physical experience. The reader <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> be at pains to realize

this book: “Originally all rules and teachings of <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> science were
expressed in a symbolical sign-language.” And on page 82, a “certain
writing system” was mentioned. Now, anyone <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> easily be led to

learn the letters of an ordinary physical language, and their combinations.
In this connection it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> be pointed out that there have been and there

supersensible experiences is that, in the course of that supersensible
experience to which the realization of the contents of this <span class="t25 hoverable">book</span> leads, the

something to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> which the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> translate into these illustrative

case in older times. Hence the <span class="t25 hoverable">book</span> replaces the former oral instruction. It
is only to a limited extent correct to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">say</span> that further personal instruction is
