both timely and timeless. To its illustrious author, whom I have
had the pleasure of knowing both in India and America, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span>

It has been my privilege to have met <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of the sages <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whose</span>

the venerable saint appeared as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of the frontispiece of my TIBETAN
YOGA AND SECRET DOCTRINES. {FN1-1} It was at Puri, in Orissa, on

the Bay of Bengal, that I encountered Sri Yukteswar. He was then the
head of a quiet ashrama near the seashore there, and was chiefly
occupied in the <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> training of a group of youthful disciples.
He expressed keen interest in the welfare of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> of the
United States and of all the Americas, and of England, too, and
questioned me concerning the distant activities, particularly those
in California, of his chief disciple, Paramhansa Yogananda, whom
he dearly loved, and whom he had sent, in 1920, as his emissary to
the West.

Sri Yukteswar was of gentle mien and voice, of pleasing presence,
and worthy of the veneration which his followers spontaneously
accorded to him. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Every</span> <span class="t9 hoverable">person</span> who knew him, whether of his own
community or not, held him in the <span class="t6 t9 t22 t29 hoverable">highest</span> esteem. I vividly recall
his tall, straight, ascetic figure, garbed in the saffron-colored
garb of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> who has renounced worldly quests, as he stood at the
entrance of the hermitage to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> me welcome. His hair was <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span>
and somewhat curly, and his face bearded. His <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> was muscularly
firm, but slender and well-formed, and his step energetic. He had
chosen as his <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> of earthly abode the <span class="t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t12 t15 t19 t20 t23 t25 hoverable">holy</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t22 t23 hoverable">city</span> of Puri, whither
multitudes of pious Hindus, representative of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> province of

"Lord of the World." It was at Puri that Sri Yukteswar closed his
mortal eyes, in 1936, to the scenes of this transitory state of
being and passed on, knowing that his incarnation had been carried

to a triumphant completion. I am glad, indeed, to be able to record
this testimony to the high character and holiness of Sri Yukteswar.
Content to remain afar from the multitude, he gave himself unreservedly
and in tranquillity to that ideal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> which Paramhansa Yogananda,

The characteristic features of Indian culture have <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> been
a search for ultimate verities and the concomitant disciple-guru
{FN1-2} relationship. My own path led me to a Christlike sage <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whose</span>

He was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>
masters who are India's sole remaining wealth. Emerging in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span>

Babylon and Egypt.

I find my earliest memories covering the anachronistic features of
a previous incarnation. Clear recollections <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> to me of a distant
life, a yogi {FN1-3} amidst the Himalayan snows. These glimpses of
the past, by some dimensionless link, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> afforded me a glimpse
of the future.

The helpless humiliations of infancy are not banished from my mind.
I was resentfully conscious of not being able to walk or express

my ear gradually accustomed itself to the circumambient Bengali
syllables of my people. The beguiling scope of an infant's mind!
adultly considered limited to toys and toes.

Psychological ferment and my unresponsive <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> <span class="t2 t4 t5 t22 t23 hoverable">brought</span> me to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span>
obstinate crying-spells. I recall the general family bewilderment
at my distress. Happier memories, too, crowd in on me: my mother's
caresses, and my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> attempts at lisping phrase and toddling
step. These early triumphs, usually forgotten quickly, are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> a
natural basis of self-confidence.

My far-reaching memories are not unique. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Many</span> yogis are <span class="t6 t10 t15 hoverable">known</span>
to have retained their self-consciousness <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> interruption by
the dramatic transition to and from "life" and "death." If <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> be
solely a body, its loss indeed places the final period to identity.
But if prophets down the millenniums spake with truth, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> is
essentially of incorporeal nature. The persistent core of <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span>
egoity is only temporarily allied with sense perception.

Although odd, clear memories of infancy are not extremely rare. During
travels in numerous lands, I have listened to early recollections
from the lips of veracious <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> and women.

I was born in the last decade of the nineteenth century, and passed
my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> eight <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span> at Gorakhpur. This was my birthplace in the
United Provinces of northeastern India. We were eight children: four
boys and four girls. I, Mukunda Lal Ghosh {FN1-4}, was the <span class="t6 hoverable">second</span>
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> and the fourth child.

Father and Mother were Bengalis, of the KSHATRIYA caste. {FN1-5} Both
were blessed with saintly nature. Their mutual love, tranquil and
dignified, <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> expressed itself frivolously. A perfect parental
harmony was the calm center for the revolving tumult of eight young
lives.

Father, Bhagabati Charan Ghosh, was kind, grave, at times stern.
Loving him dearly, we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">children</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> observed a <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> reverential
distance. An outstanding mathematician and logician, he was guided
principally by his intellect. But Mother was a queen of hearts,
and taught us only through love. After her death, <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t28 hoverable">Father</span> displayed
more of his inner tenderness. I noticed then that his gaze often
metamorphosed into my mother's.

In Mother's presence we tasted our earliest bitter-sweet acquaintance
with the scriptures. Tales from the MAHABHARATA and RAMAYANA {FN1-6}
were resourcefully summoned to meet the exigencies of discipline.
Instruction and chastisement <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t29 hoverable">hand</span> in hand.

A daily gesture of respect to <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t28 hoverable">Father</span> was <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> by Mother's dressing us
carefully in the afternoons to welcome him home from the office.
His position was similar to that of a vice-president, in the
Bengal-Nagpur Railway, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of India's large companies. His <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t7 t10 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span>
involved traveling, and our family lived in several cities during

my childhood.

Mother held an open <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t29 hoverable">hand</span> toward the needy. <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t28 hoverable">Father</span> was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> kindly
disposed, but his respect for <span class="t0 t8 t12 t15 t19 t23 t25 hoverable">law</span> and <span class="t0 t6 t7 t8 t11 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">order</span> extended to the budget.
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">One</span> fortnight Mother spent, in feeding the poor, more than Father's
monthly income.

"All I ask, please, is to keep your charities <span class="t5 t7 hoverable">within</span> a reasonable
limit." <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Even</span> a gentle rebuke from her husband was grievous to Mother.
She ordered a hackney carriage, not hinting to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">children</span> at any
disagreement.

"Good-by; I am going <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">away</span> to my mother's home." Ancient ultimatum!

We broke into astounded lamentations. Our maternal uncle arrived
opportunely; he whispered to <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t28 hoverable">Father</span> some sage counsel, garnered
no doubt from the ages. After <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t28 hoverable">Father</span> had <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> a few conciliatory
remarks, Mother happily dismissed the cab. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> ended the only trouble
I <span class="t29 hoverable">ever</span> noticed between my parents. But I recall a characteristic
discussion.

"Please <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> me ten rupees for a hapless woman who has just arrived
at the house." Mother's smile had its own persuasion.

"Why ten rupees? <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">One</span> is enough." <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t28 hoverable">Father</span> added a justification: "When

my <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t28 hoverable">father</span> and grandparents died suddenly, I had my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> taste of
poverty. My only breakfast, before walking miles to my school, was
a small banana. Later, at the university, I was in such need that
I applied to a wealthy judge for aid of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> rupee per month. He
declined, remarking that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> a rupee is important."

"How bitterly you recall the denial of that rupee!" Mother's <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t16 t19 t22 t23 t25 t26 hoverable">heart</span>
had an instant logic. "Do you want this woman <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> to remember
painfully your refusal of ten rupees which she needs urgently?"

"You win!" With the immemorial gesture of vanquished husbands, he
opened his wallet. "Here is a ten-rupee note. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Give</span> it to her with

<span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t28 hoverable">Father</span> tended to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">say</span> "No" to any <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> proposal. His attitude
toward the strange woman who so readily enlisted Mother's sympathy
was an example of his customary caution. Aversion to instant
acceptance--typical of the French <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> in the West-is really only
honoring the principle of "due reflection." I always <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t28 hoverable">Father</span>
reasonable and evenly balanced in his judgments. If I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> bolster

<span class="t0 t2 t16 t18 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">put</span> the coveted goal <span class="t5 t7 hoverable">within</span> my reach, whether it were a vacation
trip or a <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> motorcycle.

<span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t28 hoverable">Father</span> was a strict disciplinarian to his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">children</span> in their early

years, but his attitude toward himself was truly Spartan. He
<span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> visited the theater, for instance, but sought his recreation
in various <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> practices and in reading the BHAGAVAD GITA.
{FN1-7} Shunning all luxuries, he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> cling to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> <span class="t25 hoverable">old</span> pair of
shoes until they were useless. His <span class="t0 t3 t4 t24 hoverable">sons</span> bought automobiles after
they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> into popular use, but <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t28 hoverable">Father</span> was always content with the
trolley car for his daily ride to the office. The accumulation of
money for the sake of <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> was alien to his nature. Once, after
organizing the Calcutta Urban Bank, he refused to benefit himself
by holding any of its shares. He had simply wished to perform a
civic duty in his spare time.

Several <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span> after <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t28 hoverable">Father</span> had retired on a pension, an English
accountant arrived to examine the books of the Bengal-Nagpur Railway
Company. The amazed investigator discovered that <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t28 hoverable">Father</span> had <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span>
applied for overdue bonuses.

"He did the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t7 t10 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> men!" the accountant told the company.
"He has rupees 125,000 (about $41,250.) owing to him as back
compensation." The officials presented <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t28 hoverable">Father</span> with a check for
this amount. He <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> so little about it that he overlooked any
mention to the family. <span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">Much</span> later he was questioned by my youngest
brother Bishnu, who noticed the large deposit on a bank statement.

"Why be elated by material profit?" <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t28 hoverable">Father</span> replied. "The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> who

Father's naturally ascetical temperament. Mother <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> a remarkable
admission to my eldest sister Roma: "Your <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t28 hoverable">father</span> and myself live
<span class="t16 t21 hoverable">together</span> as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> and wife only once a year, for the purpose of having
children."

<span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t28 hoverable">Father</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> met Lahiri Mahasaya through Abinash Babu, {FN1-8}
an employee in the Gorakhpur office of the Bengal-Nagpur Railway.
Abinash instructed my young ears with engrossing tales of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> Indian
saints. He invariably concluded with a tribute to the superior
glories of his own guru.

"Did you <span class="t29 hoverable">ever</span> hear of the extraordinary circumstances under which
your <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t28 hoverable">father</span> became a disciple of Lahiri Mahasaya?"

It was on a lazy summer afternoon, as Abinash and I sat <span class="t16 t21 hoverable">together</span>
in the compound of my home, that he <span class="t0 t2 t16 t18 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">put</span> this intriguing question.

I shook my head with a smile of anticipation.

"Years ago, before you were born, I asked my superior officer-your
father-to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> me a week's leave from my Gorakhpur duties in <span class="t0 t6 t7 t8 t11 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">order</span>
to visit my guru in Benares. Your <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t28 hoverable">father</span> ridiculed my plan.

"'Are you going to <span class="t8 t13 hoverable">become</span> a religious fanatic?' he inquired.
'Concentrate on your office <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t7 t10 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> if you want to forge ahead.'

"Sadly walking home along a woodland path that day, I met your
<span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t28 hoverable">father</span> in a palanquin. He dismissed his servants and conveyance,
and fell into step beside me. Seeking to console me, he pointed
out the advantages of striving for worldly success. But I heard
him listlessly. My <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t16 t19 t22 t23 t25 t26 hoverable">heart</span> was repeating: 'Lahiri Mahasaya! I <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">cannot</span>
live <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> seeing you!'

"Our path <span class="t4 hoverable">took</span> us to the edge of a tranquil field, where the rays
of the late afternoon <span class="t0 t8 t11 t14 t23 t25 t28 hoverable">sun</span> were still crowning the tall ripple of
the wild grass. We paused in admiration. There in the field, only
a few yards from us, the <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> guru suddenly appeared!
{FN1-9}

"'Bhagabati, you are too hard on your employee!' His voice was
resonant in our astounded ears. He vanished as mysteriously as he
had come. On my knees I was exclaiming, 'Lahiri Mahasaya! Lahiri

Mahasaya!' Your <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t28 hoverable">father</span> was motionless with stupefaction for a few
moments.

"'Abinash, not only do I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> YOU leave, but I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> MYSELF leave to
start for Benares tomorrow. I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">know</span> this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Lahiri Mahasaya,
who is able to materialize himself at will in <span class="t0 t6 t7 t8 t11 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">order</span> to intercede
for you! I will <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">take</span> my wife and ask this <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">master</span> to initiate us in
his <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> path. Will you guide us to him?'

"'Of course.' Joy filled me at the miraculous answer to my prayer,
and the quick, favorable turn of events.

"The next evening your parents and I entrained for Benares. We
<span class="t4 hoverable">took</span> a horse cart the following day, and then had to walk through
narrow lanes to my guru's secluded home. Entering his little parlor,
we bowed before the master, enlocked in his habitual lotus posture.
He blinked his piercing eyes and leveled them on your father.

"'Bhagabati, you are too hard on your employee!' His <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">words</span> were the
same as those he had <span class="t27 hoverable">used</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t11 t20 t26 t27 hoverable">days</span> before in the Gorakhpur field.
He added, 'I am glad that you have allowed Abinash to visit me,
and that you and your wife have accompanied him.'

"To their joy, he initiated your parents in the <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> practice
of KRIYA YOGA. {FN1-10} Your <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t28 hoverable">father</span> and I, as brother disciples,

have been close friends since the memorable <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> of the vision.
Lahiri Mahasaya <span class="t4 hoverable">took</span> a definite interest in your own birth. Your
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> surely be linked with his own: the master's blessing
<span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> fails."

Lahiri Mahasaya left this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> shortly after I had entered it.
His picture, in an ornate frame, always graced our family altar in
the various cities to which <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t28 hoverable">Father</span> was transferred by his office.
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Many</span> a morning and evening <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> Mother and me meditating before an
improvised shrine, offering flowers dipped in fragrant sandalwood
paste. With frankincense and myrrh as <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t8 t10 t12 t13 t14 t17 t19 t23 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> as our united devotions,
we honored the divinity which had <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> full expression in Lahiri
Mahasaya.

His picture had a surpassing influence over my life. As I grew,
the <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> of the <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">master</span> grew with me. In meditation I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> often
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> his photographic image emerge from its small frame and, taking
a living form, sit before me. When I attempted to touch the feet
of his luminous body, it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> change and again <span class="t8 t13 hoverable">become</span> the picture.
As childhood slipped into boyhood, I <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> Lahiri Mahasaya transformed
in my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> from a little image, cribbed in a frame, to a living,
enlightening presence. I frequently prayed to him in moments of
trial or confusion, finding <span class="t5 t7 hoverable">within</span> me his solacing direction. At
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> I grieved because he was no longer physically living. As I
began to discover his secret omnipresence, I lamented no more. He

had often <span class="t23 hoverable">written</span> to those of his disciples who were over-anxious
to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> him: "Why <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> to view my bones and flesh, when I am <span class="t29 hoverable">ever</span>
<span class="t5 t7 hoverable">within</span> range of your KUTASTHA (spiritual sight)?"

I was blessed about the age of eight with a wonderful healing
through the photograph of Lahiri Mahasaya. This experience gave
intensification to my love. While at our family estate in Ichapur,
Bengal, I was stricken with Asiatic cholera. My <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> was despaired
of; the doctors <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> do nothing. At my bedside, Mother frantically
motioned me to look at Lahiri Mahasaya's picture on the wall above
my head.

"Bow to him mentally!" She knew I was too feeble <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> to lift my
hands in salutation. "If you really show your devotion and inwardly
kneel before him, your <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> will be spared!"

I gazed at his photograph and saw there a blinding light, enveloping
my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> and the entire room. My nausea and other uncontrollable
symptoms disappeared; I was well. At once I felt strong enough to
bend over and touch Mother's feet in appreciation of her immeasurable
faith in her guru. Mother pressed her head repeatedly against the
little picture.

"O Omnipresent Master, I thank <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thee</span> that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thy</span> <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hath</span> healed my
son!"

I realized that she too had witnessed the luminous blaze through
which I had instantly recovered from a usually fatal disease.

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">One</span> of my most precious possessions is that same photograph. <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Given</span>
to <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t28 hoverable">Father</span> by Lahiri Mahasaya himself, it carries a <span class="t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t12 t15 t19 t20 t23 t25 hoverable">holy</span> vibration.
The picture had a miraculous origin. I heard the story from Father's
brother disciple, Kali Kumar Roy.

It appears that the <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">master</span> had an aversion to being photographed.
Over his protest, a group picture was once <span class="t19 hoverable">taken</span> of him and
a cluster of devotees, including Kali Kumar Roy. It was an amazed
photographer who discovered that the <span class="t14 hoverable">plate</span> which had clear images
of all the disciples, revealed <span class="t15 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">nothing</span> more than a blank space in
the center where he had reasonably expected to find the outlines
of Lahiri Mahasaya. The phenomenon was widely discussed.

A <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> student and expert photographer, Ganga Dhar Babu, boasted
that the fugitive figure <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> not escape him. The next morning,
as the guru sat in lotus posture on a wooden bench with a screen
behind him, Ganga Dhar Babu arrived with his equipment. Taking <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span>
precaution for success, he greedily exposed twelve plates. On each
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> he soon <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> the imprint of the wooden bench and screen, but
once again the master's <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> was missing.

With tears and shattered pride, Ganga Dhar Babu sought out his
guru. It was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> hours before Lahiri Mahasaya broke his silence
with a pregnant comment:

"I am Spirit. Can your camera reflect the omnipresent Invisible?"

"I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> it cannot! But, <span class="t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t12 t15 t19 t20 t23 t25 hoverable">Holy</span> Sir, I lovingly desire a picture of
the bodily temple where alone, to my narrow vision, that <span class="t0 t1 t3 t5 t7 t8 t13 t16 t18 t20 t21 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">Spirit</span>
appears fully to dwell."

"Come, then, tomorrow morning. I will pose for you."

Again the photographer focused his camera. This <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> the sacred
figure, not cloaked with mysterious imperceptibility, was sharp on
the plate. The <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">master</span> <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> posed for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">another</span> picture; at least,
I have seen none.

The photograph is reproduced in this book. Lahiri Mahasaya's fair
features, of a universal cast, hardly suggest to what race he
belonged. His intense joy of God-communion is slightly revealed in
a somewhat enigmatic smile. His eyes, half open to denote a nominal
direction on the outer world, are half closed also. Completely
oblivious to the poor lures of the earth, he was fully awake at
all times to the <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> problems of seekers who approached for
his bounty.

Shortly after my healing through the potency of the guru's picture,
I had an influential <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> vision. Sitting on my bed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> morning,
I fell into a deep reverie.

"What is behind the darkness of closed eyes?" This probing <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span>
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> powerfully into my mind. An immense flash of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> at once
manifested to my inward gaze. <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> shapes of saints, sitting in
meditation posture in mountain caves, formed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> miniature cinema
pictures on the large screen of radiance <span class="t5 t7 hoverable">within</span> my forehead.

"Who are you?" I spoke aloud.

"We are the Himalayan yogis." The celestial response is difficult
to describe; my <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t16 t19 t22 t23 t25 t26 hoverable">heart</span> was thrilled.

"Ah, I <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> to go to the Himalayas and <span class="t8 t13 hoverable">become</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> you!" The vision
vanished, but the silvery beams expanded in ever-widening circles
to infinity.

"What is this wondrous glow?"

"I am Iswara.{FN1-11} I am Light." The voice was as murmuring
clouds.

"I want to be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> with Thee!"

Out of the slow dwindling of my <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> ecstasy, I salvaged a permanent
legacy of inspiration to seek God. "He is eternal, ever-new Joy!"
This memory persisted <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> after the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> of rapture.

I bear the scar to this day. My elder sister Uma and I were seated
in the early morning under a NEEM tree in our Gorakhpur compound.
She was helping me with a Bengali primer, what <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> spare
my gaze from the near-by parrots eating ripe margosa fruit. Uma
complained of a boil on her leg, and fetched a jar of ointment. I
smeared a bit of the salve on my forearm.

"Why do you use medicine on a healthy arm?"

"Well, Sis, I feel I am going to have a boil tomorrow. I am testing
your ointment on the spot where the boil will appear."

"You little liar!"

"Sis, don't call me a liar until you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> what happens in the
morning." Indignation filled me.

Uma was unimpressed, and thrice repeated her taunt. An adamant

resolution sounded in my voice as I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> slow reply.

"By the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of will in me, I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">say</span> that tomorrow I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> have

Morning <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> me with a stalwart boil on the indicated spot; the
dimensions of Uma's boil had doubled. With a shriek, my sister
rushed to Mother. "Mukunda has <span class="t8 t13 hoverable">become</span> a necromancer!" Gravely,
Mother instructed me <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> to use the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">words</span> for doing
harm. I have always remembered her counsel, and followed it.

My boil was surgically treated. A noticeable scar, left by
the doctor's incision, is present today. On my <span class="t27 hoverable">right</span> forearm is a
constant reminder of the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> in man's sheer word.

Those simple and apparently harmless phrases to Uma, spoken
with deep concentration, had possessed sufficient hidden force to
explode <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> bombs and produce definite, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> injurious, effects.
I understood, later, that the explosive vibratory <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> in speech

Our family moved to Lahore in the Punjab. There I acquired a picture
of the <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Mother in the <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of the Goddess Kali. {FN1-13} It

sanctified a small informal shrine on the balcony of our home. An
unequivocal conviction <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> over me that fulfillment <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> crown any
of my prayers uttered in that sacred spot. Standing there with Uma
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> day, I watched <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> kites flying over the roofs of the buildings
on the opposite side of the very narrow lane.

"Why are you so quiet?" Uma pushed me playfully.

"I am just thinking how wonderful it is that <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Mother gives
me whatever I ask."

"I suppose She <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> you those <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> kites!" My sister laughed
derisively.

"Why not?" I began silent prayers for their possession.

Matches are played in India with kites <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whose</span> strings are covered
with glue and ground glass. Each player attempts to sever the string
of his opponent. A freed kite sails over the roofs; there is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>
fun in catching it. Inasmuch as Uma and I were on the balcony, it
seemed impossible that any loosed kite <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> into our hands;
its string <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> naturally dangle over the roofs.

The players across the lane began their match. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">One</span> string was cut;
immediately the kite floated in my direction. It was stationary

for a moment, through sudden abatement of breeze, which sufficed
to firmly entangle the string with a cactus plant on top of the
opposite house. A perfect loop was formed for my seizure. I handed
the prize to Uma.

"It was just an extraordinary accident, and not an answer to your
prayer. If the other kite comes to you, then I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> believe."
Sister's dark eyes conveyed more amazement than her words.

I continued my prayers with a crescendo intensity. A forcible tug
by the other player resulted in the abrupt loss of his kite. It
headed toward me, dancing in the wind. My helpful assistant, the
cactus plant, again secured the kite string in the necessary loop
by which I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> grasp it. I presented my <span class="t6 hoverable">second</span> trophy to Uma.

"Indeed, <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Mother listens to you! This is all too uncanny for
me!" Sister bolted <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">away</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> a frightened fawn.

MY MOTHER'S <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">DEATH</span> AND THE MYSTIC AMULET

My mother's greatest desire was the marriage of my elder brother.
"Ah, when I <span class="t0 t5 t16 t22 hoverable">behold</span> the face of Ananta's wife, I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> find <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t15 t18 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heaven</span>
on this earth!" I frequently heard Mother express in these <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">words</span>
her strong Indian sentiment for family continuity.

I was about eleven <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span> <span class="t25 hoverable">old</span> at the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of Ananta's betrothal.
Mother was in Calcutta, joyously supervising the wedding preparations.
<span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t28 hoverable">Father</span> and I alone remained at our home in Bareilly in northern
India, whence <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t28 hoverable">Father</span> had been transferred after <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span> at Lahore.

I had previously witnessed the splendor of nuptial rites for my
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> elder sisters, Roma and Uma; but for Ananta, as the eldest son,

plans were truly elaborate. Mother was welcoming numerous relatives,
daily arriving in Calcutta from distant homes. She lodged them
comfortably in a large, newly acquired <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> at 50 Amherst Street.
Everything was in readiness-the banquet delicacies, the gay throne
on which Brother was to be carried to the home of the bride-to-be,
the rows of colorful lights, the mammoth cardboard elephants and
camels, the English, Scottish and Indian orchestras, the professional
entertainers, the priests for the ancient rituals.

<span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t28 hoverable">Father</span> and I, in gala spirits, were planning to join the family
in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> for the ceremony. Shortly before the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> day, however,
I had an ominous vision.

It was in Bareilly on a midnight. As I slept beside <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t28 hoverable">Father</span> on the
piazza of our bungalow, I was awakened by a peculiar flutter of
the mosquito netting over the bed. The flimsy curtains parted and
I saw the beloved <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of my mother.

"Awaken your father!" Her voice was only a whisper. "Take the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span>
available train, at four o'clock this morning. Rush to Calcutta if
you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> me!" The wraithlike figure vanished.

"Father, Father! Mother is dying!" The terror in my tone aroused
him instantly. I sobbed out the fatal tidings.

"Never <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> that hallucination of yours." <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t28 hoverable">Father</span> gave his characteristic
negation to a <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> situation. "Your mother is in excellent health.
If we get any bad news, we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> leave tomorrow."

"You <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> forgive yourself for not starting now!" Anguish
caused me to add bitterly, "Nor <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> I <span class="t29 hoverable">ever</span> forgive you!"

The melancholy morning <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> with explicit words: "Mother dangerously
ill; marriage postponed; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> at once."

<span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t28 hoverable">Father</span> and I left distractedly. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">One</span> of my uncles met us en route
at a transfer point. A train thundered toward us, looming with
telescopic increase. From my inner tumult, an abrupt determination
arose to hurl myself on the railroad tracks. Already bereft, I
felt, of my mother, I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> not endure a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> suddenly barren to
the bone. I loved Mother as my dearest friend on earth. Her solacing
black eyes had been my surest refuge in the trifling tragedies of
childhood.

"Does she <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> live?" I stopped for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> last question to my uncle.

"Of course she is alive!" He was not slow to interpret the desperation
in my face. But I scarcely believed him.

When we reached our Calcutta home, it was only to confront the

stunning mystery of death. I collapsed into an almost lifeless
state. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">Years</span> passed before any reconciliation entered my heart.
Storming the very gates of heaven, my cries at last summoned the
<span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Mother. Her <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">words</span> <span class="t2 t4 t5 t22 t23 hoverable">brought</span> final healing to my suppurating
wounds:

"It is I who have watched over thee, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> after life, in the

<span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t28 hoverable">Father</span> and I returned to Bareilly soon after the crematory
rites for the well-beloved.

memorial--pilgrimage to a large SHEOLI tree which shaded the
smooth, green-gold lawn before our bungalow. In poetical moments,
I <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> that the white SHEOLI flowers were strewing themselves
with a willing devotion over the grassy altar. Mingling tears with
the dew, I often observed a strange other-worldly <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> emerging
from the dawn. Intense pangs of longing for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> assailed me. I felt
powerfully drawn to the Himalayas.

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">One</span> of my cousins, fresh from a period of travel in the <span class="t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t12 t15 t19 t20 t23 t25 hoverable">holy</span> hills,
visited us in Bareilly. I listened eagerly to his tales about the
high mountain abode of yogis and swamis. {FN2-1}

"Let us run <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">away</span> to the Himalayas." My suggestion <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> to

Dwarka Prasad, the young <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> of our landlord in Bareilly, fell on
unsympathetic ears. He revealed my plan to my elder brother, who
had just arrived to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> Father. Instead of laughing lightly over
this impractical scheme of a small boy, Ananta <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> it a definite
point to ridicule me.

"Where is your orange robe? You can't be a swami <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> that!"

But I was inexplicably thrilled by his words. They <span class="t2 t4 t5 t22 t23 hoverable">brought</span> a clear
picture of myself roaming about India as a monk. Perhaps they
awakened memories of a past life; in any case, I began to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> with
what natural ease I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> wear the garb of that anciently-founded
monastic order.

Chatting <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> morning with Dwarka, I felt a <span class="t7 hoverable">love</span> for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> descending
with avalanchic force. My companion was only partly attentive to
the ensuing eloquence, but I was wholeheartedly listening to myself.

I fled that afternoon toward Naini Tal in the Himalayan foothills.
Ananta gave determined chase; I was forced to return sadly to
Bareilly. The only pilgrimage permitted me was the customary <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span>
at dawn to the SHEOLI tree. My <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t16 t19 t22 t23 t25 t26 hoverable">heart</span> wept for the lost Mothers,
<span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> and divine.

The rent left in the family fabric by Mother's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> was irreparable.

Father <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> remarried during his nearly forty remaining years.
Assuming the difficult role of Father-Mother to his little flock,
he grew noticeably more tender, more approachable. With calmness
and insight, he solved the various family problems. After office
hours he retired <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> a hermit to the cell of his room, practicing

to engage an English nurse to attend to details that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> my

"Service to me ended with your mother." His eyes were remote with
a lifelong devotion. "I will not accept ministrations from any
other woman."

Fourteen months after Mother's passing, I learned that she had left
me a momentous message. Ananta was present at her deathbed and had
recorded her words. Although she had asked that the disclosure be

He was soon to leave
Bareilly for Calcutta, to marry the girl Mother had chosen for him.

"Mukunda, I have been reluctant to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> you strange tidings."
Ananta's tone held a <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t9 t12 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">note</span> of resignation. "My fear was to inflame

your desire to leave home. But in any case you are bristling with

box, and delivered Mother's message.

"Let these <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">words</span> be my final blessing, my beloved <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> Mukunda!"

into my room.

"'Mistress, a strange SADHU {FN2-3} is here. He insists that he

"These simple <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">words</span> struck a profound chord <span class="t5 t7 hoverable">within</span> me; I <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> at

again:

"'You are to be the custodian of a <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> silver amulet. I will

"I proffered alms {FN2-5} to the saint, and bowed before him

a silver amulet materialized between my palms, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> as the SADHU

A blaze of illumination <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> over me with possession of the amulet;

How the talisman finally vanished amidst deeply unhappy circumstances
of my life; and how its loss was a herald of my gain of a guru,

Benares, a number of rupee notes, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> letters.

"I have a business matter to propose to a Benares friend, Kedar
Nath Babu. Unfortunately I have lost his address. But I believe you
will be able to get this letter to him through our common friend,
Swami Pranabananda. The swami, my brother disciple, has attained
an exalted <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> stature. You will benefit by his company; this
<span class="t6 hoverable">second</span> <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t9 t12 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">note</span> will serve as your introduction."

Father's eyes twinkled as he added, "Mind, no more flights from
home!"

I <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t15 t17 t18 t19 hoverable">set</span> <span class="t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t9 t10 t11 t13 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">forth</span> with the zest of my twelve <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span> (though <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> has
<span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> dimmed my delight in <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> scenes and strange faces). Reaching
Benares, I proceeded immediately to the swami's residence. The
front door was open; I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> to a long, hall-like room on
the <span class="t6 hoverable">second</span> floor. A rather stout man, wearing only a loincloth, was
seated in lotus posture on a slightly raised platform. His head and
unwrinkled face were clean-shaven; a beatific smile played about
his lips. To dispel my <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> that I had intruded, he greeted me
as an <span class="t25 hoverable">old</span> friend.

"BABA ANAND (bliss to my dear one)." His welcome was <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> heartily
in a childlike voice. I knelt and touched his feet.

"Are you Swami Pranabananda?"

He nodded. "Are you Bhagabati's son?" His <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">words</span> were out before I
had had <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> to get Father's letter from my pocket. In astonishment,
I handed him the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t9 t12 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">note</span> of introduction, which now seemed superfluous.

"Of course I will locate Kedar Nath Babu for you." The saint again
surprised me by his clairvoyance. He glanced at the letter, and
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> a few affectionate references to my parent.

"You know, I am enjoying <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> pensions. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">One</span> is by the recommendation
of your father, for whom I once worked in the railroad office. The
other is by the recommendation of my Heavenly Father, for whom I
have conscientiously finished my earthly duties in life."

I <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> this remark very obscure. "What kind of pension, sir, do
you receive from the Heavenly Father? Does He drop money in your
lap?"

He laughed. "I mean a pension of fathomless peace-a reward for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span>
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span> of deep meditation. I <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> crave money now. My few material

needs are amply provided for. Later you will understand the
significance of a <span class="t6 hoverable">second</span> pension."

Abruptly terminating our conversation, the saint became gravely
motionless. A sphinxlike air enveloped him. At <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> his eyes
sparkled, as if observing something of interest, then grew dull. I
felt abashed at his pauciloquy; he had not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> told me how I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span>
meet Father's friend. A trifle restlessly, I looked about me in
the bare room, empty except for us two. My idle gaze <span class="t4 hoverable">took</span> in his
wooden sandals, lying under the platform seat.

"Little sir, {FN3-1} don't get worried. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> you wish to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span>
will be with you in half an hour." The yogi was reading my mind-a
feat not too difficult at the moment!

Again he fell into inscrutable silence. My watch informed me that
thirty minutes had elapsed.

The swami aroused himself. "I think Kedar Nath Babu is nearing the
door."

I heard somebody coming up the stairs. An amazed incomprehension
arose suddenly; my thoughts raced in confusion: "How is it possible
that Father's friend has been summoned to this <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> the
help of a messenger? The swami has spoken to no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> but myself

since my arrival!"

Abruptly I quitted the room and descended the steps. Halfway down
I met a thin, fair-skinned <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> of medium height. He appeared to be
in a hurry.

"Are you Kedar Nath Babu?" Excitement colored my voice.

"Yes. Are you not Bhagabati's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> who has been waiting here to meet
me?" He smiled in friendly fashion.

"Sir, how do you happen to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> here?" I felt baffled resentment
over his inexplicable presence.

"Everything is mysterious today! Less than an hour ago I had just
finished my bath in the Ganges when Swami Pranabananda approached
me. I have no idea how he knew I was there at that time.

"'Bhagabati's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> is waiting for you in my apartment,' he said.
'Will you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> with me?' I gladly agreed. As we proceeded <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t29 hoverable">hand</span> in
hand, the swami in his wooden sandals was strangely able to outpace
me, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> I wore these stout walking shoes.

"'How <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> will it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">take</span> you to reach my place?' Pranabanandaji
suddenly halted to ask me this question.

"'About half an hour.'

"'I have something else to do at present.' He gave me an enigmatical
glance. 'I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> leave you behind. You can join me in my house,
where Bhagabati's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> and I will be awaiting you.'

"Before I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> remonstrate, he dashed swiftly past me and disappeared
in the crowd. I walked here as fast as possible."

This explanation only increased my bewilderment. I inquired how
<span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> he had <span class="t6 t10 t15 hoverable">known</span> the swami.

"We met a few times last year, but not recently. I was very glad
to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> him again today at the bathing GHAT."

"I <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">cannot</span> believe my ears! Am I losing my mind? Did you meet him
in a vision, or did you actually <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> him, touch his hand, and hear
the sound of his feet?"

"I don't <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">know</span> what you're driving at!" He flushed angrily. "I am
not lying to you. Can't you understand that only through the swami
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> I have <span class="t6 t10 t15 hoverable">known</span> you were waiting at this <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> for me?"

"Why, that man, Swami Pranabananda, has not left my sight a moment

since I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> about an hour ago." I blurted out the <span class="t3 t5 t7 t9 t20 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span>
story.

His eyes opened widely. "Are we living in this material age, or
are we dreaming? I <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> expected to witness such a miracle in my
life! I <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> this swami was just an ordinary man, and now I find
he can materialize an extra <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> and <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t7 t10 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> through it!" <span class="t16 t21 hoverable">Together</span> we
entered the saint's room.

"Look, those are the very sandals he was wearing at the GHAT,"
Kedar Nath Babu whispered. "He was clad only in a loincloth, just
as I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> him now."

As the visitor bowed before him, the saint turned to me with a
quizzical smile.

"Why are you stupefied at all this? The subtle unity of the phenomenal
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> is not hidden from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> yogis. I instantly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> and converse
with my disciples in distant Calcutta. They can similarly transcend
at will <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> obstacle of gross matter."

It was probably in an effort to stir <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> ardor in my young
breast that the swami had condescended to tell me of his powers of
astral radio and television. {FN3-2} But instead of enthusiasm, I
experienced only an awe-stricken fear. Inasmuch as I was destined

to undertake my <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> search through <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> particular guru-Sri
Yukteswar, whom I had not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> met-I felt no inclination to accept
Pranabananda as my teacher. I glanced at him doubtfully, wondering
if it were he or his counterpart before me.

If a disciple, I reflected, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> materialize an extra fleshly <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span>

"I will tell you how priceless is a guru's help. I <span class="t27 hoverable">used</span> to meditate
with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">another</span> disciple for eight hours <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> night.

during the entire night.

"Immeasurably uplifted, I returned to my home. In meditation that

Pranabananda's face was suffused with <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> light. The peace of

a further confidence.

"Some months later I returned to Lahiri Mahasaya and tried to
thank him for his bestowal of the infinite gift. Then I mentioned

"'Apply for a pension from your company.'

"'What reason <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> I give, so early in my service?'

for my premature request.

"'At work, I find an overpowering sensation rising in my spine.

"Without further questioning the physician recommended me highly
for a pension, which I soon received. I <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">know</span> the <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> will of
Lahiri Mahasaya worked through the doctor and the railroad officials,
including your father. Automatically they obeyed the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> guru's

with the Beloved." {FN3-5}

After this extraordinary revelation, Swami Pranabananda retired
into <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of his <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> silences. As I was taking leave, touching his
feet reverently, he gave me his blessing:

"Your <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> belongs to the path of renunciation and yoga.

fulfillment to both these predictions. {FN3-6}

Kedar Nath Babu walked by my side in the gathering darkness. I
delivered Father's letter, which my companion read under a street
lamp.

"Your <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t28 hoverable">father</span> suggests that I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">take</span> a position in the Calcutta office

{FN3-1} CHOTO MAHASAYA is the term by which a number of Indian
saints addressed me. It translates "little sir.".

{FN3-2} In its own way, physical science is affirming the validity
of laws discovered by yogis through mental science. For example,

a demonstration that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> has televisional powers was <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> on Nov.

persons and objects on the opposite side of a wall. Dr. Calligaris
told the other professors that if <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> areas on the skin are
agitated, the subject is <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> super-sensorial impressions enabling

Calligaris pressed on a spot to the <span class="t27 hoverable">right</span> of the thorax for fifteen
minutes.

overwhelming, but the yogi learns to control its outward manifestations.

CHAPTER: 4

MY INTERRUPTED FLIGHT TOWARD THE HIMALAYAS

"Leave your classroom on some trifling pretext, and engage a hackney
carriage. Stop in the lane where no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> in my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> can <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> you."

These were my final instructions to Amar Mitter, a high school
friend who planned to accompany me to the Himalayas. We had chosen
the following <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> for our flight. Precautions were necessary,
as Ananta exercised a vigilant eye. He was determined to foil the
plans of escape which he suspected were uppermost in my mind. The
amulet, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> a <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> yeast, was silently at <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t7 t10 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> <span class="t5 t7 hoverable">within</span> me.
Amidst the Himalayan snows, I hoped to find the <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">master</span> <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whose</span> face
often appeared to me in visions.

The family was living now in Calcutta, where <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t28 hoverable">Father</span> had been
permanently transferred. Following the patriarchal Indian custom,

Ananta had <span class="t2 t4 t5 t22 t23 hoverable">brought</span> his bride to live in our home, now at 4 Gurpar
Road. There in a small attic room I engaged in daily meditations
and prepared my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> for the <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> search.

The memorable morning arrived with inauspicious rain. Hearing the
wheels of Amar's carriage in the road, I hastily tied <span class="t16 t21 hoverable">together</span> a
blanket, a pair of sandals, Lahiri Mahasaya's picture, a copy of
the BHAGAVAD GITA, a string of prayer beads, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> loincloths.
This bundle I threw from my third-story window. I ran down the
steps and passed my uncle, buying fish at the door.

"What is the excitement?" His gaze roved suspiciously over my
person.

I gave him a noncommittal smile and walked to the lane. Retrieving
my bundle, I joined Amar with conspiratorial caution. We drove to
Chadni Chowk, a merchandise center. For months we had been saving
our tiffin money to buy English clothes. Knowing that my clever
brother <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> easily play the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of a detective, we <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> to
outwit him by European garb.

On the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> to the station, we stopped for my cousin, Jotin Ghosh,
whom I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Jatinda. He was a <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> convert, longing for a guru
in the Himalayas. He donned the <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> suit we had in readiness.
Well-camouflaged, we hoped! A deep elation possessed our hearts.

"All we need now are canvas shoes." I led my companions to a shop
displaying rubber-soled footwear. "Articles of leather, gotten
only through the slaughter of animals, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> be absent on this <span class="t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t12 t15 t19 t20 t23 t25 hoverable">holy</span>
trip." I halted on the street to remove the leather cover from my
BHAGAVAD GITA, and the leather straps from my English-made SOLA
TOPEE (helmet).

At the station we bought tickets to Burdwan, where we planned to
transfer for Hardwar in the Himalayan foothills. As soon as the
train, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> ourselves, was in flight, I gave utterance to a few of
my glorious anticipations.

"Just imagine!" I ejaculated. "We <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> be initiated by the masters
and experience the trance of cosmic consciousness. Our flesh will
be charged with such magnetism that wild animals of the Himalayas
will <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> tamely near us. Tigers will be no more than meek <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span>
cats awaiting our caresses!"

This remark-picturing a prospect I considered entrancing, both
metaphorically and literally-brought an enthusiastic smile from
Amar. But Jatinda averted his gaze, directing it through the window
at the scampering landscape.

"Let the money be divided in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> portions." Jatinda broke a <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span>

silence with this suggestion. "Each of us should buy his own ticket
at Burdwan. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> at the station will surmise that we are
running <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">away</span> together."

I unsuspectingly agreed. At dusk our train stopped at Burdwan.
Jatinda entered the ticket office; Amar and I sat on the platform.
We waited fifteen minutes, then <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> unavailing inquiries. Searching
in all directions, we shouted Jatinda's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> with the urgency
of fright. But he had faded into the dark unknown surrounding the
little station.

I was completely unnerved, shocked to a peculiar numbness. That <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span>
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> countenance this depressing episode! The romantic occasion
of my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> carefully-planned flight after Him was cruelly marred.

"Amar, we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> return home." I was weeping <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> a child. "Jatinda's
callous departure is an ill omen. This trip is doomed to failure."

"Is this your <span class="t7 hoverable">love</span> for the Lord? Can't you stand the little test
of a treacherous companion?"

Through Amar's suggestion of a <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> test, my <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t16 t19 t22 t23 t25 t26 hoverable">heart</span> steadied
itself. We refreshed ourselves with famous Burdwan sweetmeats,
SITABHOG (food for the goddess) and MOTICHUR (nuggets of sweet
pearl). In a few hours, we entrained for Hardwar, via Bareilly.

Changing trains at Moghul Serai, we discussed a vital matter as we
waited on the platform.

"Amar, we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> soon be closely questioned by railroad officials.
I am not underrating my brother's ingenuity! No matter what the
outcome, I will not speak untruth."

"All I ask of you, Mukunda, is to keep still. Don't laugh or grin
while I am talking."

At this moment, a European station agent accosted me. He waved a
telegram <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whose</span> import I immediately grasped.

"Are you running <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">away</span> from home in anger?"

"No!" I was glad his choice of <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">words</span> permitted me to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> emphatic
reply. Not anger but "divinest melancholy" was responsible, I knew,
for my unconventional behavior.

The official then turned to Amar. The duel of wits that followed
hardly permitted me to maintain the counseled stoic gravity.

"Where is the third boy?" The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> injected a full ring of authority
into his voice. "Come on; speak the truth!"

"Sir, I notice you are wearing eyeglasses. Can't you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> that
we are only two?" Amar smiled impudently. "I am not a magician; I
can't conjure up a third companion."

The official, noticeably disconcerted by this impertinence, sought
a <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> field of attack.

"What is your name?"

"I am <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Thomas. I am the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> of an English mother and a
converted Christian Indian father."

"What is your friend's name?"

"I call him Thompson."

By this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> my inward mirth had reached a zenith; I unceremoniously
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> for the train, whistling for departure. Amar followed with
the official, who was credulous and obliging enough to <span class="t0 t2 t16 t18 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">put</span> us into
a European compartment. It evidently pained him to think of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span>
half-English boys traveling in the section allotted to natives. After
his polite exit, I lay back on the seat and laughed uncontrollably.
My friend wore an expression of blithe satisfaction at having
outwitted a veteran European official.

On the platform I had contrived to read the telegram. From my brother,
it <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> thus: "Three Bengali boys in English clothes running <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">away</span>
from home toward Hardwar via Moghul Serai. Please detain them until
my arrival. Ample reward for your services."

"Amar, I told you not to leave marked timetables in your home." My
glance was reproachful. "Brother <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> have <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> there."

My friend sheepishly acknowledged the thrust. We halted briefly
in Bareilly, where Dwarka Prasad awaited us with a telegram from
Ananta. My <span class="t25 hoverable">old</span> friend tried valiantly to detain us; I convinced him
that our flight had not been undertaken lightly. As on a previous
occasion, Dwarka refused my invitation to <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t15 t17 t18 t19 hoverable">set</span> <span class="t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t9 t10 t11 t13 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">forth</span> to the Himalayas.

While our train stood in a station that night, and I was half asleep,
Amar was awakened by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">another</span> questioning official. He, too, fell a
victim to the hybrid charms of "Thomas" and "Thompson." The train
bore us triumphantly into a dawn arrival at Hardwar. The majestic
mountains loomed invitingly in the distance. We dashed through the
station and entered the freedom of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t22 t23 hoverable">city</span> crowds. Our <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> act was
to change into native costume, as Ananta had somehow penetrated
our European disguise. A premonition of capture weighed on my mind.

Deeming it advisable to leave Hardwar at once, we bought tickets to
proceed north to Rishikesh, a soil <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> hallowed by feet of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span>

masters. I had already boarded the train, while Amar lagged on
the platform. He was <span class="t2 t4 t5 t22 t23 hoverable">brought</span> to an abrupt halt by a shout from a
policeman. Our unwelcome guardian escorted us to a station bungalow
and <span class="t4 hoverable">took</span> charge of our money. He explained courteously that it was
his duty to hold us until my elder brother arrived.

Learning that the truants' destination had been the Himalayas, the
officer related a strange story.

"I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> you are crazy about saints! You will <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> meet a greater
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> than the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> I saw only yesterday. My brother officer
and I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> encountered him five <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t11 t20 t26 t27 hoverable">days</span> ago. We were patrolling by the
Ganges, on a sharp lookout for a <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> murderer. Our instructions
were to capture him, alive or dead. He was <span class="t6 t10 t15 hoverable">known</span> to be masquerading
as a SADHU in <span class="t0 t6 t7 t8 t11 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">order</span> to rob pilgrims. A short <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> before us, we
spied a figure which resembled the description of the criminal. He
ignored our command to stop; we ran to overpower him. Approaching
his back, I wielded my ax with tremendous force; the man's <span class="t27 hoverable">right</span>
arm was severed almost completely from his body.

"Without outcry or any glance at the ghastly wound, the stranger
astonishingly continued his swift pace. As we jumped in front of
him, he spoke quietly.

"'I am not the murderer you are seeking.'

"I was deeply mortified to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> I had injured the <span class="t9 hoverable">person</span> of a
divine--looking sage. Prostrating myself at his feet, I implored
his pardon, and offered my turban-cloth to staunch the heavy spurts
of blood.

"'Son, that was just an understandable mistake on your part.' The
saint regarded me kindly. 'Run along, and don't reproach yourself.
The Beloved Mother is taking care of me.' He pushed his dangling
arm into its stump and lo! it adhered; the blood inexplicably ceased
to flow.

"'Come to me under yonder tree in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t11 t20 t26 t27 hoverable">days</span> and you will find me
fully healed. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> you will feel no remorse.'

"Yesterday my brother officer and I <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> eagerly to the designated
spot. The SADHU was there and allowed us to examine his arm. It
bore no scar or trace of hurt!

"'I am going via Rishikesh to the Himalayan solitudes.' He blessed
us as he departed quickly. I feel that my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> has been uplifted
through his sanctity."

The officer concluded with a pious ejaculation; his experience had
obviously moved him beyond his usual depths. With an impressive

gesture, he handed me a printed clipping about the miracle. In
the usual garbled manner of the sensational type of newspaper (not
missing, alas! <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> in India), the reporter's version was slightly
exaggerated: it indicated that the SADHU had been almost decapitated!

Amar and I lamented that we had missed the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> yogi who <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span>
forgive his persecutor in such a Christlike way. India, materially

by the wayside, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> by worldly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> this policeman.

We thanked the officer for relieving our tedium with his marvelous
story. He was probably intimating that he was more fortunate than
we: he had met an illumined saint <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> effort; our earnest search
had ended, not at the feet of a master, but in a coarse police
station!

So near the Himalayas and yet, in our captivity, so far, I told
Amar I felt doubly impelled to seek freedom.

"Let us slip <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">away</span> when opportunity offers. We can go on foot to
<span class="t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t12 t15 t19 t20 t23 t25 hoverable">holy</span> Rishikesh." I smiled encouragingly.

But my companion had turned pessimist as soon as the stalwart prop
of our money had been <span class="t19 hoverable">taken</span> from us.

"If we started a trek over such dangerous jungle land, we should
finish, not in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t22 t23 hoverable">city</span> of saints, but in the stomachs of tigers!"

Ananta and Amar's brother arrived after <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> days. Amar greeted
his relative with affectionate relief. I was unreconciled; Ananta
got no more from me than a severe upbraiding.

"I understand how you feel." My brother spoke soothingly. "All I
ask of you is to accompany me to Benares to meet a <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> saint,
and go on to Calcutta to visit your grieving <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t28 hoverable">father</span> for a few days.
Then you can resume your search here for a master."

Amar entered the conversation at this point to disclaim any intention
of returning to Hardwar with me. He was enjoying the familial
warmth. But I knew I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> abandon the quest for my guru.

Our party entrained for Benares. There I had a singular and instant
response to my prayers.

A clever scheme had been prearranged by Ananta. Before seeing me
at Hardwar, he had stopped in Benares to ask a <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> scriptural
authority to interview me later. Both the pundit and his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> had
promised to undertake my dissuasion from the path of a SANNYASI.
{FN4-1}

Ananta <span class="t4 hoverable">took</span> me to their home. The son, a young <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> of ebullient
manner, greeted me in the courtyard. He engaged me in a lengthy
philosophic discourse. Professing to have a clairvoyant <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span>
of my future, he discountenanced my idea of being a monk.

"You will meet continual misfortune, and be unable to find God, if
you insist on deserting your ordinary responsibilities! You <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">cannot</span>
<span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t7 t10 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> out your past karma {FN4-2} <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> worldly experiences."

Krishna's immortal <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">words</span> rose to my lips in reply: "'Even he with
the worst of karma who ceaselessly meditates on Me quickly loses
the effects of his past bad actions. Becoming a high-souled being,
he soon attains perennial peace. Arjuna, <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">know</span> this for certain:
the devotee who puts his trust in Me <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> perishes!'" {FN4-3}

But the forceful prognostications of the young <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> had slightly
shaken my confidence. With all the fervor of my <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t16 t19 t22 t23 t25 t26 hoverable">heart</span> I prayed
silently to God:

"Please solve my bewilderment and answer me, <span class="t27 hoverable">right</span> here and now, if
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thou</span> dost desire me to lead the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of a renunciate or a worldly
man!"

I noticed a SADHU of noble countenance standing just outside

the compound of the pundit's house. Evidently he had overheard
the spirited conversation between the self-styled clairvoyant and
myself, for the stranger <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> me to his side. I felt a tremendous
<span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> flowing from his calm eyes.

"Son, don't listen to that ignoramus. In response to your prayer,
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> tells me to assure you that your sole path in this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span>
is that of the renunciate."

With astonishment as <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t8 t10 t12 t13 t14 t17 t19 t23 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> as gratitude, I smiled happily at this
decisive message.

"Come <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">away</span> from that man!" The "ignoramus" was calling me from the
courtyard. My saintly guide raised his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t29 hoverable">hand</span> in blessing and slowly
departed.

"That SADHU is just as crazy as you are." It was the hoary-headed
pundit who <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> this charming observation. He and his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> were
gazing at me lugubriously. "I heard that he too has left his home
in a vague search for God."

I turned away. To Ananta I remarked that I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> not engage in
further discussion with our hosts. My brother agreed to an immediate
departure; we soon entrained for Calcutta.

"Mr. Detective, how did you discover I had fled with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> companions?"
I vented my lively curiosity to Ananta during our homeward journey.
He smiled mischievously.

"At your school, I <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> that Amar had left his classroom and had
not returned. I <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> to his home the next morning and unearthed a
marked timetable. Amar's <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t28 hoverable">father</span> was just leaving by carriage and
was talking to the coachman.

"'My <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> will not ride with me to his school this morning. He has
disappeared!' the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t28 hoverable">father</span> moaned.

"'I heard from a brother coachman that your <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> others,
dressed in European suits, boarded the train at Howrah Station,'
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> stated. 'They <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> a present of their leather shoes to the
cab driver.'

"Thus I had <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> clues-the timetable, the trio of boys, and the
English clothing."

I was listening to Ananta's disclosures with mingled mirth and
vexation. Our generosity to the coachman had been slightly misplaced!

"Of course I rushed to send telegrams to station officials in all
the cities which Amar had underlined in the timetable. He had checked
Bareilly, so I wired your friend Dwarka there. After inquiries
in our Calcutta neighborhood, I learned that cousin Jatinda had
been absent <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> night but had arrived home the following morning
in European garb. I sought him out and invited him to dinner. He
accepted, quite disarmed by my friendly manner. On the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> I led him
unsuspectingly to a police station. He was surrounded by several
officers whom I had previously selected for their ferocious
appearance. Under their formidable gaze, Jatinda agreed to account
for his mysterious conduct.

"'I started for the Himalayas in a buoyant <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> mood,' he
explained. 'Inspiration filled me at the prospect of meeting the
masters. But as soon as Mukunda said, "During our ecstasies in the
Himalayan caves, tigers will be spellbound and sit around us <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span>
tame pussies," my spirits froze; beads of perspiration formed on
my brow. "What then?" I thought. "If the vicious <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of the
tigers be not changed through the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of our <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> trance,

shall they treat us with the kindness of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> cats?" In my mind's
eye, I already saw myself the compulsory inmate of some tiger's
stomach-entering there not at once with the <span class="t3 t5 t7 t9 t20 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> body, but by
installments of its several parts!'"

My anger at Jatinda's vanishment was evaporated in laughter. The
hilarious sequel on the train was worth all the anguish he had
caused me. I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> confess to a slight feeling of satisfaction:
Jatinda too had not escaped an encounter with the police!

"Ananta, {FN4-4} you are a born sleuthhound!" My glance of amusement
was not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> some exasperation. "And I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> tell Jatinda I am
glad he was prompted by no mood of treachery, as it appeared, but
only by the prudent instinct of self-preservation!"

At home in Calcutta, <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t28 hoverable">Father</span> touchingly requested me to curb my roving
feet until, at least, the completion of my high school studies.
In my absence, he had lovingly hatched a plot by arranging for
a saintly pundit, Swami Kebalananda, {FN4-5} to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> regularly to
the house.

"The sage will be your Sanskrit tutor," my parent announced
confidently.

<span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t28 hoverable">Father</span> hoped to satisfy my religious yearnings by instructions

from a learned philosopher. But the tables were subtly turned: my
<span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> teacher, <span class="t6 t9 t18 t26 hoverable">far</span> from offering intellectual aridities, fanned the
embers of my God-aspiration. Unknown to Father, Swami Kebalananda
was an exalted disciple of Lahiri Mahasaya. The peerless guru had
possessed thousands of disciples, silently drawn to him by the
irresistibility of his <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> magnetism. I learned later that Lahiri
Mahasaya had often characterized Kebalananda as RISHI or illumined
sage.

Luxuriant curls framed my tutor's handsome face. His dark eyes were
guileless, with the transparency of a child's. All the movements of
his slight <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> were marked by a restful deliberation. <span class="t29 hoverable">Ever</span> gentle
and loving, he was firmly established in the infinite consciousness.
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Many</span> of our happy hours <span class="t16 t21 hoverable">together</span> were spent in deep KRIYA meditation.

Kebalananda was a noted authority on the ancient SHASTRAS or sacred
books: his erudition had earned him the title of "Shastri Mahasaya,"
by which he was usually addressed. But my progress in Sanskrit
scholarship was unnoteworthy. I sought <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> opportunity to forsake
prosaic grammar and to talk of yoga and Lahiri Mahasaya. My tutor
obliged me <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> by telling me something of his own <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> with
the master.

"Rarely fortunate, I was able to remain near Lahiri Mahasaya for
ten years. His Benares home was my nightly goal of pilgrimage. The

guru was always present in a small front parlor on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> floor.
As he sat in lotus posture on a backless wooden seat, his disciples
garlanded him in a semicircle. His eyes sparkled and danced with
the joy of the Divine. They were <span class="t29 hoverable">ever</span> half closed, peering through
the inner telescopic orb into a sphere of eternal bliss. He seldom
spoke at length. Occasionally his gaze <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> focus on a student in
need of help; healing <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">words</span> poured then <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> an avalanche of light.

"An indescribable peace blossomed <span class="t5 t7 hoverable">within</span> me at the master's glance.
I was permeated with his fragrance, as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> from a lotus of
infinity. To be with him, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> exchanging a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">word</span> for days,
was experience which changed my entire being. If any invisible
barrier rose in the path of my concentration, I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> meditate at
the guru's feet. There the most tenuous states <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> easily <span class="t5 t7 hoverable">within</span>
my grasp. Such perceptions eluded me in the presence of lesser
teachers. The <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">master</span> was a living temple of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whose</span> secret doors

"Lahiri Mahasaya was no bookish interpreter of the scriptures.
Effortlessly he dipped into the 'divine library.' Foam of <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">words</span> and
spray of thoughts gushed from the fountain of his omniscience. He
had the wondrous clavis which unlocked the profound philosophical
science embedded ages ago in the VEDAS. {FN4-6} If asked to explain
the <span class="t1 t2 t18 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">different</span> planes of consciousness mentioned in the ancient
texts, he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> smilingly assent.

The taciturn guru often gave this instruction to a near-by disciple.
'I will guide your thoughts, that the <span class="t27 hoverable">right</span> interpretation be
uttered.' In this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> of Lahiri Mahasaya's perceptions <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span>
to be recorded, with voluminous commentaries by various students.

"The <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">master</span> <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> counseled slavish belief. 'Words are only shells,'
he said. 'Win conviction of God's presence through your own joyous
contact in meditation.'

"No matter what the disciple's problem, the guru advised KRIYA YOGA
for its solution.

"'The yogic key will not lose its efficiency when I am no longer
present in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> to guide you.

"I myself consider KRIYA the most effective device of salvation through

self-effort <span class="t29 hoverable">ever</span> to be evolved in man's search for the Infinite."
Kebalananda concluded with this earnest testimony. "Through its use,
the omnipotent God, hidden in all men, became visibly incarnated
in the flesh of Lahiri Mahasaya and a number of his disciples."

A Christlike miracle by Lahiri Mahasaya <span class="t4 hoverable">took</span> <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> in Kebalananda's

remote from the Sanskrit texts before us.

"A blind disciple, Ramu, aroused my active pity. Should he have no

the <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> was fully blazing? <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">One</span> morning I sought to speak to
Ramu, but he sat for patient hours fanning the guru with a hand-made
palm-leaf PUNKHA. When the devotee finally left the room, I followed
him.

"'Ramu, how <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> have you been blind?'

"'From my birth, sir! <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">Never</span> have my eyes been blessed with a glimpse
of the sun.'

"'Our omnipotent guru can help you. Please <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> a supplication.'

"The following <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> Ramu diffidently approached Lahiri Mahasaya. The
disciple felt almost ashamed to ask that physical wealth be added

to his <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> superabundance.

"'Master, the Illuminator of the cosmos is in you. I pray you
to <span class="t22 hoverable">bring</span> His <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> into my eyes, that I perceive the sun's lesser
glow.'

"'Ramu, someone has connived to <span class="t0 t2 t16 t18 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">put</span> me in a difficult position. I
have no healing power.'

"'Sir, the Infinite <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">One</span> <span class="t5 t7 hoverable">within</span> you can certainly heal.'

"'That is indeed different, Ramu. God's limit is nowhere! He who
ignites the stars and the cells of flesh with mysterious life-effulgence
can surely <span class="t22 hoverable">bring</span> luster of vision into your eyes.'

"The <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">master</span> touched Ramu's forehead at the point between the eyebrows.
{FN4-7} "'Keep your <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> concentrated there, and frequently chant

"Lo! in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> week it was so.

fair face of nature. The Omniscient <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">One</span> had unerringly directed his

saints. Ramu's faith was the devotionally ploughed soil in which
the guru's powerful seed of permanent healing sprouted." Kebalananda

was silent for a moment, then paid a further tribute to his guru.

"It was evident in all miracles performed by Lahiri Mahasaya that
he <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> allowed the ego-principle {FN4-9} to consider itself a
causative force. By perfection of resistless surrender, the <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">master</span>
enabled the Prime Healing <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Power</span> to flow freely through him.

"The numerous bodies which were spectacularly healed through Lahiri
Mahasaya eventually had to feed the flames of cremation. But the
silent <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> awakenings he effected, the Christlike disciples
he fashioned, are his imperishable miracles."

I <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> became a Sanskrit scholar; Kebalananda taught me a diviner
syntax.

{FN4-1} Literally, "renunciate." From Sanskrit verb roots, "to cast

{FN4-2} Effects of past actions, in this or a former life; from
Sanskrit KRI, "to do."

recently published in Bengali. Born in the Khulna district of

{FN4-7} The seat of the "single" or <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> eye. At <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> the

{FN4-8} The central sacred figure of the Sanskrit epic, RAMAYANA.

{FN4-9} Ahankara, egoism; literally, "I do." The root <span class="t1 t3 t9 t15 t20 t21 t26 t29 hoverable">cause</span> of

object; the creatures imagine themselves to be creators.

under the heaven."

I did not have this wisdom of Solomon to comfort me; I gazed
searchingly about me, on any excursion from home, for the face of
my destined guru. But my path did not cross his own until after
the completion of my high school studies.

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Two</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span> elapsed between my flight with Amar toward the Himalayas,
and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> of Sri Yukteswar's arrival into my life. During

that interim I met a number of sages-the "Perfume Saint," the "Tiger
Swami," Nagendra Nath Bhaduri, <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> Mahasaya, and the famous
Bengali scientist, Jagadis Chandra Bose.

My encounter with the "Perfume Saint" had <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> preambles, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span>
harmonious and the other humorous.

"God is simple. Everything else is complex. Do not seek absolute
values in the relative <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> of nature."

These philosophical finalities gently entered my ear as I stood
silently before a temple image of Kali. Turning, I confronted a
tall <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whose</span> garb, or lack of it, revealed him a wandering SADHU.

"You have indeed penetrated the bewilderment of my thoughts!" I
smiled gratefully. "The confusion of benign and terrible aspects
in nature, as symbolized by Kali, {FN5-1} has puzzled wiser heads
than mine!"

"Few there be who solve her mystery! <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Good</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> is the challenging

he plucks the cleaveless <span class="t3 t7 t9 t10 t15 t19 t22 hoverable">truth</span> of unity."

"You speak with conviction, sir."

"I have <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> exercised an honest introspection, the exquisitely
painful approach to wisdom. Self-scrutiny, relentless observance of
one's thoughts, is a stark and shattering experience. It pulverizes
the stoutest ego. But <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> self-analysis mathematically operates
to produce seers. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> of 'self-expression,' individual
acknowledgments, results in egotists, sure of the <span class="t27 hoverable">right</span> to their

"Truth humbly retires, no doubt, before such arrogant originality."
I was enjoying the discussion.

"Man can understand no eternal verity until he has freed himself
from pretensions. The <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> mind, bared to a centuried slime, is

buries his ideals, surrendering to the common fate. Can he seem
other than impotent, wooden, ignominious?"

"Respected Sir, have you no sympathy for the bewildered masses?"

The sage was silent for a moment, then answered obliquely.

"To <span class="t7 hoverable">love</span> both the invisible God, Repository of All Virtues, and
visible man, apparently possessed of none, is often baffling! But
ingenuity is equal to the maze. Inner research soon exposes a unity
in all <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> minds-the stalwart kinship of selfish motive.

humility follows this leveling discovery. It ripens into compassion
for one's fellows, blind to the healing potencies of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span>

"The saints of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> age, sir, have felt <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> yourself for the

"Only the shallow <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> loses responsiveness to the woes of others'
lives, as he sinks into narrow suffering of his own." The SADHU'S
austere face was noticeably softened. "The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> who practices a

his Creator, if for no other reason than to ask in anguish: 'Why,
Lord, why?' By ignoble whips of pain, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> is driven at last into

The sage and I were present in Calcutta's Kalighat Temple, whither
I had gone to view its famed magnificence. With a sweeping gesture,
my chance companion dismissed the ornate dignity.

"Bricks and mortar sing us no audible tune; the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t16 t19 t22 t23 t25 t26 hoverable">heart</span> opens only
to the <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> chant of being."

We strolled to the inviting sunshine at the entrance, where throngs
of devotees were passing to and fro.

"You are young." The sage surveyed me thoughtfully. "India too is
young. The ancient RISHIS {FN5-3} laid down ineradicable patterns
of <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> living. Their hoary dictums suffice for this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span>
and land. Not outmoded, not unsophisticated against the guiles
of materialism, the disciplinary precepts mold India still. By
millenniums-more than embarrassed scholars care to compute!-the
skeptic <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Time</span> has validated Vedic worth. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Take</span> it for your heritage."

As I was reverently bidding farewell to the eloquent SADHU, he
revealed a clairvoyant perception:

"After you leave here today, an unusual experience will <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> your
way."

I quitted the temple precincts and wandered along aimlessly. Turning
a corner, I ran into an <span class="t25 hoverable">old</span> acquaintance-one of those long-winded
fellows <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whose</span> conversational powers ignore <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> and embrace eternity.

"I will <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">let</span> you go in a very short while, if you will tell me all
that has happened during the six <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span> of our separation."

"What a paradox! I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> leave you now."

But he held me by the hand, forcing out tidbits of information.
He was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> a ravenous wolf, I <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> in amusement; the longer I
spoke, the more hungrily he sniffed for news. Inwardly I petitioned
the Goddess Kali to devise a graceful <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t14 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">means</span> of escape.

My companion left me abruptly. I sighed with relief and doubled my
pace, dreading any relapse into the garrulous fever. Hearing rapid
footsteps behind me, I quickened my speed. I dared not look back.
But with a bound, the youth rejoined me, jovially clasping my
shoulder.

"I forgot to tell you of Gandha Baba (Perfume Saint), who is gracing
yonder house." He pointed to a dwelling a few yards distant. "Do
meet him; he is interesting. You <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> have an unusual experience.
Good-by," and he actually left me.

The similarly worded prediction of the SADHU at Kalighat Temple
flashed to my mind. Definitely intrigued, I entered the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> and
was ushered into a commodious parlor. A crowd of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> were sitting,
Orient-wise, here and there on a thick orange-colored carpet. An
awed whisper reached my ear:

"Behold Gandha Baba on the leopard skin. He can <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> the natural
perfume of any flower to a scentless one, or revive a wilted blossom,
or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> a person's skin exude delightful fragrance."

I looked directly at the saint; his quick gaze rested on mine. He
was plump and bearded, with dark skin and large, gleaming eyes.

"Son, I am glad to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> you. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Say</span> what you want. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Would</span> you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> some
perfume?"

"What for?" I <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> his remark rather childish.

"To experience the miraculous <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> of enjoying perfumes."

"Harnessing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> odors?"

"What of it? <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> makes perfume anyway."

"Yes, but He fashions frail bottles of petals for fresh use and

discard. Can you materialize flowers?"

"I materialize perfumes, little friend."

"Then scent factories will go out of business."

"I will permit them to keep their trade! My own purpose is to
demonstrate the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of God."

"Sir, is it necessary to prove God? Isn't He performing miracles
in everything, everywhere?"

"Yes, but we too should manifest some of His infinite creative
variety."

"How <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> did it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">take</span> to <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">master</span> your art?"

"Twelve years."

"For manufacturing scents by astral means! It seems, my honored
saint, you have been wasting a dozen <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span> for fragrances which
you can obtain with a few rupees from a florist's shop."

"Perfumes fade with flowers."

"Perfumes fade with death. Why should I desire that which pleases
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> only?"

"Mr. Philosopher, you please my mind. Now, stretch <span class="t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t9 t10 t11 t13 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">forth</span> your <span class="t27 hoverable">right</span>
hand." He <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> a gesture of blessing.

I was a few feet <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">away</span> from Gandha Baba; no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> else was near
enough to contact my body. I extended my hand, which the yogi did
not touch.

"What perfume do you want?"

"Rose."

"Be it so."

To my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> surprise, the charming fragrance of rose was wafted
strongly from the center of my palm. I smilingly <span class="t4 hoverable">took</span> a large white
scentless flower from a near-by vase.

"Can this odorless blossom be permeated with jasmine?"

"Be it so."

A jasmine fragrance instantly shot from the petals. I thanked the

wonder-worker and seated myself by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of his students. He informed
me that Gandha Baba, <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whose</span> proper <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> was Vishudhananda, had
learned <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> astonishing yoga secrets from a <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">master</span> in Tibet. The
Tibetan yogi, I was assured, had attained the age of over a thousand
years.

"His disciple Gandha Baba does not always perform his perfume-feats
in the simple verbal manner you have just witnessed." The student
spoke with obvious pride in his master. "His procedure differs
widely, to accord with diversity in temperaments. He is marvelous!
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Many</span> members of the Calcutta intelligentsia are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span> his followers."

I inwardly resolved not to add myself to their number. A guru too
literally "marvelous" was not to my liking. With polite thanks to
Gandha Baba, I departed. Sauntering home, I reflected on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span>
varied encounters the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> had <span class="t2 t4 t5 t22 t23 hoverable">brought</span> forth.

My sister Uma met me as I entered our Gurpar Road door.

"You are getting quite stylish, using perfumes!"

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Without</span> a word, I motioned her to smell my hand.

"What an attractive rose fragrance! It is unusually strong!"

Thinking it was "strongly unusual," I silently placed the astrally
scented blossom under her nostrils.

"Oh, I <span class="t7 hoverable">love</span> jasmine!" She seized the flower. A ludicrous bafflement
passed over her face as she repeatedly sniffed the odor of jasmine
from a type of flower she <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t8 t10 t12 t13 t14 t17 t19 t23 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> knew to be scentless. Her reactions
disarmed my suspicion that Gandha Baba had induced an auto-suggestive
state whereby I alone <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> detect the fragrances.

Later I heard from a friend, Alakananda, that the "Perfume Saint"
had a <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> which I wish were possessed by the starving millions

"I was present with a hundred other guests at Gandha Baba's home
in Burdwan," Alakananda told me. "It was a gala occasion. Because
the yogi was reputed to have the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of extracting objects
out of thin air, I laughingly requested him to materialize some
out-of-season tangerines. Immediately the LUCHIS {FN5-4} which
were present on all the banana-leaf plates became puffed up. Each
of the bread-envelopes proved to contain a peeled tangerine. I bit
into my own with some trepidation, but <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> it delicious."

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">Years</span> later I understood by inner realization how Gandha Baba
accomplished his materializations. The method, alas! is beyond the
reach of the world's hungry hordes.

The <span class="t1 t2 t18 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">different</span> sensory stimuli to which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> reacts-tactual, visual,
gustatory, auditory, and olfactory-are produced by vibratory
variations in electrons and protons. The vibrations in turn are
regulated by "lifetrons," subtle <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> forces or finer-than-atomic
energies intelligently charged with the five distinctive sensory
idea-substances.

Gandha Baba, tuning himself with the cosmic force by <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> yogic
practices, was able to guide the lifetrons to rearrange their
vibratory structure and objectivize the desired result. His perfume,
fruit and other miracles were actual materializations of mundane
vibrations, and not inner sensations hypnotically produced. {FN5-5}

Performances of miracles such as shown by the "Perfume Saint" are
spectacular but spiritually useless. Having little purpose beyond
entertainment, they are digressions from a serious search for God.

Hypnotism has been <span class="t27 hoverable">used</span> by physicians in minor operations as a sort
of psychical chloroform for persons who <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t18 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">might</span> be endangered by an
anesthetic. But a hypnotic state is harmful to those often subjected to
it; a negative psychological effect ensues which in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> deranges
the brain cells. Hypnotism is trespass into the territory of
another's consciousness. Its temporary phenomena have <span class="t15 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">nothing</span> in
common with the miracles performed by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> of <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> realization.

Ostentatious display of unusual powers are decried by masters. The
Persian mystic, Abu Said, once laughed at <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> FAKIRS who were
proud of their miraculous powers over water, air, and space.

"A frog is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> at home in the water!"

<span class="t4 t18 t22 hoverable">Neither</span> the impartial sage at Kalighat Temple nor the Tibetan-trained

the world. The eminent French chemist, M. Georges Claude, performed
"miracles" at Fontainebleau in 1928 before a scientific assemblage
through his chemical <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of oxygen transformations. His
"magician's wand" was simple oxygen, bubbling in a tube on a table.
The scientist "turned a handful of sand into precious stones,
iron into a state resembling melted chocolate and, after depriving
flowers of their tints, turned them into the consistency of glass.

"M. Claude explained how the sea <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> be turned by oxygen

by turning their faces black by taking the red out of the sun's
rays."

This noted French scientist has produced liquid air by an expansion
method in which he has been able to separate the various gases of
the air, and has discovered various <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t14 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">means</span> of mechanical utilization

CHAPTER: 6

THE TIGER SWAMI

"I have discovered the Tiger Swami's address. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Let</span> us visit him
tomorrow."

This welcome suggestion <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> from Chandi, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of my high school
friends. I was eager to meet the saint who, in his premonastic
life, had caught and fought tigers with his naked hands. A boyish
enthusiasm over such remarkable feats was strong <span class="t5 t7 hoverable">within</span> me.

The next <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> dawned wintry cold, but Chandi and I sallied <span class="t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t9 t10 t11 t13 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">forth</span>
gaily. After <span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">much</span> vain hunting in Bhowanipur, outside Calcutta, we
arrived at the <span class="t27 hoverable">right</span> house. The door held <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> iron rings, which I
sounded piercingly. Notwithstanding the clamor, a servant approached
with leisurely gait. His ironical smile implied that visitors,
despite their noise, were powerless to disturb the calmness of a
saint's home.

Feeling the silent rebuke, my companion and I were thankful to be
invited into the parlor. Our <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> wait there caused uncomfortable
misgivings. India's unwritten <span class="t0 t8 t12 t15 t19 t23 t25 hoverable">law</span> for the <span class="t3 t7 t9 t10 t15 t19 t22 hoverable">truth</span> seeker is patience;

This psychological ruse is freely employed in the West by doctors
and dentists!

Finally summoned by the servant, Chandi and I entered a sleeping
apartment. The famous Sohong {FN6-1} Swami was seated on his bed.
The sight of his tremendous <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> affected us strangely. With bulging
eyes, we stood speechless. We had <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> before seen such a chest or
such football-like biceps. On an immense neck, the swami's fierce
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> calm face was adorned with flowing locks, beard and moustache.
A hint of dovelike and tigerlike qualities shone in his dark eyes.
He was unclothed, save for a tiger skin about his muscular waist.

Finding our voices, my friend and I greeted the monk, expressing
our admiration for his prowess in the extraordinary feline arena.

"Will you not tell us, please, how it is possible to subdue with
bare fists the most ferocious of jungle beasts, the royal Bengals?"

"My sons, it is <span class="t15 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">nothing</span> to me to fight tigers. I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> do it today
if necessary." He gave a childlike laugh. "You look <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> tigers as

"Swamiji, I think I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> impress my subconsciousness with the

"Of course strength <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> is necessary! <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">One</span> <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">cannot</span> expect victory

are my sufficient weapon."

He asked us to follow him to the patio, where he struck the edge
of a wall. A brick crashed to the floor; the sky peered boldly
through the gaping lost tooth of the wall. I fairly staggered in
astonishment; he who can remove mortared bricks from a solid wall
with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> blow, I thought, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> surely be able to displace the teeth

fairly strong <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> and an immensely strong determination, to turn
the tables on the tiger, and force it to a conviction of pussycat
defenselessness. How often I have done just that!"

I was quite willing to believe that the titan before me was able to
perform the tiger-pussycat metamorphosis. He seemed in a didactic
mood; Chandi and I listened respectfully.

"Mind is the wielder of muscles. The force of a hammer blow depends
on the energy applied; the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> expressed by a man's bodily instrument
depends on his aggressive will and courage. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> is literally
manufactured and sustained by mind. Through pressure of instincts
from past lives, strengths or weaknesses percolate gradually into
<span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> consciousness. They express as habits, which in turn ossify
into a desirable or an undesirable body. Outward frailty has
mental origin; in a vicious circle, the habit-bound <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> thwarts
the mind. If the <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">master</span> allows himself to be commanded by a servant,
the latter becomes autocratic; the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> is similarly enslaved by
submitting to bodily dictation."

At our entreaty, the impressive swami consented to tell us something
of his own life.

"My earliest ambition was to fight tigers. My will was mighty, but
my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> was feeble."

An ejaculation of surprise broke from me. It appeared incredible
that this man, now "with Atlantean shoulders, fit to bear," <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span>

ever have <span class="t6 t10 t15 hoverable">known</span> weakness.

"It was by indomitable persistency in thoughts of health and
strength that I overcame my handicap. I have <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> reason to extol
the compelling mental vigor which I <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> to be the real subduer
of royal Bengals."

"Do you think, revered swami, that I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> <span class="t29 hoverable">ever</span> fight tigers?" This
was the first, and the last, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> that the bizarre ambition <span class="t29 hoverable">ever</span>
visited my mind!

"Yes." He was smiling. "But there are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> kinds of tigers; some
roam in jungles of <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> desires. No <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> benefit accrues
by knocking beasts unconscious. Rather be victor over the inner
prowlers."

"May we hear, sir, how you changed from a tamer of wild tigers to
a tamer of wild passions?"

The Tiger Swami fell into silence. Remoteness <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> into his gaze,
summoning visions of bygone years. I discerned his slight mental
struggle to decide whether to grant my request. Finally he smiled
in acquiescence.

"When my fame reached a zenith, it <span class="t2 t4 t5 t22 t23 hoverable">brought</span> the intoxication of

pride. I decided not only to fight tigers but to display them in
various tricks. My ambition was to force savage beasts to behave
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> domesticated ones. I began to perform my feats publicly, with
gratifying success.

"One evening my <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t28 hoverable">father</span> entered my room in pensive mood.

"'Son, I have <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">words</span> of warning. I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> save you from coming ills,
produced by the grinding wheels of <span class="t1 t3 t9 t15 t20 t21 t26 t29 hoverable">cause</span> and effect.'

"'Are you a fatalist, Father? Should superstition be allowed to
discolor the powerful waters or my activities?'

"'I am no fatalist, son. But I believe in the just <span class="t0 t8 t12 t15 t19 t23 t25 hoverable">law</span> of retribution,
as taught in the <span class="t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t12 t15 t19 t20 t23 t25 hoverable">holy</span> scriptures. There is resentment against you
in the jungle family; sometime it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> act to your cost.'

"'Father, you astonish me! You <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t8 t10 t12 t13 t14 t17 t19 t23 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">know</span> what tigers are-beautiful
but merciless! <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Even</span> immediately after an enormous meal of some
hapless creature, a tiger is fired with fresh lust at sight of <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span>
prey. It <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be a joyous gazelle, frisking over the jungle grass.
Capturing it and biting an opening in the soft throat, the malevolent
beast tastes only a little of the mutely crying blood, and goes
its wanton way.

"'Tigers are the most contemptible of the jungle breed! Who knows?
my blows <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> inject some slight sanity of consideration into their
thick heads. I am headmaster in a forest finishing school, to teach
them gentle manners!

"'Please, Father, think of me as tiger tamer and <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> as tiger
killer. How <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> actions <span class="t22 hoverable">bring</span> ill <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> me?

to impose any command that I change my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> of life.'"

Chandi and I were all attention, understanding the past dilemma.
In India a child does not lightly disobey his parents' wishes.

"In stoic silence <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t28 hoverable">Father</span> listened to my explanation. He followed
it with a disclosure which he uttered gravely.

"'Son, you compel me to relate an ominous prediction from the lips
of a saint. He approached me yesterday as I sat on the veranda in
my daily meditation.

"'"Dear friend, I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> with a message for your belligerent son. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Let</span>
him cease his savage activities. Otherwise, his next tiger-encounter

sickness. He <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> then forsake his former ways and <span class="t8 t13 hoverable">become</span> a monk."'

"This tale did not impress me. I considered that <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t28 hoverable">Father</span> had been

the credulous victim of a deluded fanatic."

The Tiger Swami <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> this confession with an impatient gesture, as
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> at some stupidity. Grimly silent for a <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> time, he seemed
oblivious of our presence. When he <span class="t4 hoverable">took</span> up the dangling thread of
his narrative, it was suddenly, with subdued voice.

"Not <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> after Father's warning, I visited the capital <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t22 t23 hoverable">city</span> of
Cooch Behar. The picturesque territory was <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> to me, and I expected
a restful change. As usual everywhere, a curious crowd followed me
on the streets. I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> catch bits of whispered comment:

"'This is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> who fights wild tigers.'

"'Has he legs, or tree-trunks?'

"'Look at his face! He <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> be an incarnation of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> of tigers

"You <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">know</span> how village urchins function <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> final editions of a

"I was relaxing quietly in the evening, when I heard the hoofbeats

of galloping horses. They stopped in front of my dwelling place.
In <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> a number of tall, turbaned policemen.

"I was <span class="t19 hoverable">taken</span> aback. 'All <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> are possible <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">unto</span> these creatures
of <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> law,' I thought. 'I wonder if they are going to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">take</span> me to
task about matters utterly unknown to me.' But the officers bowed
with unwonted courtesy.

"'Honored Sir, we are sent to welcome you on behalf of the Prince
of Cooch Behar. He is pleased to invite you to his palace tomorrow
morning.'

"I speculated awhile on the prospect. For some obscure reason I
felt sharp regret at this interruption in my quiet trip. But the
suppliant manner of the policemen moved me; I agreed to go.

"I was bewildered the next <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> to be obsequiously escorted from my
door into a magnificent coach drawn by four horses. A servant held
an ornate umbrella to protect me from the scorching sunlight. I
enjoyed the pleasant ride through the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t22 t23 hoverable">city</span> and its woodland outskirts.
The royal scion himself was at the palace door to welcome me. He
proffered his own gold-brocaded seat, smilingly placing himself in
a chair of simpler design.

"'All this politeness is certainly going to cost me something!' I

thought in mounting astonishment. The prince's motive emerged after
a few casual remarks.

"'My <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t22 t23 hoverable">city</span> is filled with the rumor that you can fight wild tigers
with <span class="t15 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">nothing</span> more than your naked hands. Is it a fact?'

"'It is quite true.'

"'I can scarcely believe it! You are a Calcutta Bengali, nurtured
on the white rice of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t22 t23 hoverable">city</span> folk. Be frank, please; have you not been
fighting only spineless, opium-fed animals?' His voice was loud
and sarcastic, tinged with provincial accent.

"I vouchsafed no reply to his insulting question.

"'I challenge you to fight my newly-caught tiger, Raja Begum.

"His insolent <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">words</span> struck me <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> a volley of bullets. I shot an
angry acceptance. Half risen from the chair in his excitement, the
prince sank back with a sadistic smile. I was reminded of the Roman

emperors who delighted in setting Christians in bestial arenas.

"'The match will be <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t15 t17 t18 t19 hoverable">set</span> for a week hence. I regret that I <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">cannot</span>

"Whether the prince feared I <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t18 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">might</span> seek to hypnotize the beast, or

"I left the palace, noting with amusement that the royal umbrella
and panoplied coach were now missing.

"The following week I methodically prepared my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> for
the coming ordeal. Through my servant I learned of fantastic tales.
The saint's direful prediction to my <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t28 hoverable">father</span> had somehow got abroad,
enlarging as it ran. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Many</span> simple villagers believed that an <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span>
spirit, cursed by the gods, had reincarnated as a tiger which <span class="t4 hoverable">took</span>
various demoniac forms at night, but remained a striped animal
during the day. This demon-tiger was supposed to be the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> sent
to humble me.

"Another imaginative version was that animal prayers to Tiger
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t15 t18 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Heaven</span> had achieved a response in the shape of Raja Begum. He was
to be the instrument to punish me-the audacious biped, so insulting
to the entire tiger species! A furless, fangless <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> daring
to challenge a claw-armed, sturdy-limbed tiger! The concentrated

venom of all humiliated tigers-the villagers declared-had gathered
momentum sufficient to operate hidden laws and <span class="t22 hoverable">bring</span> about the fall
of the proud tiger tamer.

"My servant further apprized me that the prince was in his element
as manager of the bout between <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> and beast. He had supervised
the erection of a storm-proof pavilion, designed to accommodate
thousands. Its center held Raja Begum in an enormous iron cage,
surrounded by an outer safety room. The captive emitted a ceaseless
<span class="t14 hoverable">series</span> of blood-curdling roars. He was fed sparingly, to kindle a
wrathful appetite. Perhaps the prince expected me to be the meal
of reward!

"Crowds from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t22 t23 hoverable">city</span> and suburbs bought tickets eagerly in response
to the beat of drums announcing the unique contest. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> of
battle saw hundreds turned <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">away</span> for lack of seats. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Many</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> broke
through the tent openings, or crowded any space below the galleries."

As the Tiger Swami's story approached a climax, my excitement
mounted with it; Chandi <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> was raptly mute.

"Amidst piercing sound-explosions from Raja Begum, and the hubbub
of the somewhat terrified crowd, I quietly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> my appearance. Scantily
clad around the waist, I was otherwise unprotected by clothing. I
opened the bolt on the door of the safety room and calmly locked

it behind me. The tiger sensed blood. Leaping with a thunderous
crash on his bars, he sent <span class="t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t9 t10 t11 t13 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">forth</span> a fearsome welcome. The audience
was hushed with pitiful fear; I seemed a meek lamb before the raging
beast.

"In a trice I was <span class="t5 t7 hoverable">within</span> the cage; but as I slammed the door, Raja
Begum was headlong <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> me. My <span class="t27 hoverable">right</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t29 hoverable">hand</span> was desperately torn.
<span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Human</span> blood, the greatest treat a tiger can know, fell in appalling
streams. The prophecy of the saint seemed about to be fulfilled.

"I rallied instantly from the shock of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> serious injury
I had <span class="t29 hoverable">ever</span> received. Banishing the sight of my gory fingers by
thrusting them beneath my waist cloth, I swung my left arm in a
bone-cracking blow. The beast reeled back, swirled around the rear
of the cage, and sprang forward convulsively. My famous fistic
punishment rained on his head.

"But Raja Begum's taste of blood had acted <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> the maddening <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span>
sip of wine to a dipsomaniac long-deprived. Punctuated by deafening
roar, the brute's assaults grew in fury. My inadequate defense
of only <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t29 hoverable">hand</span> left me vulnerable before claws and fangs. But I
dealt out dazing retribution. Mutually ensanguined, we struggled
as to the death. The cage was pandemonium, as blood splashed in
all directions, and blasts of pain and lethal lust <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> from the
bestial throat.

"'Shoot him!' 'Kill the tiger!' Shrieks arose from the audience.
So fast did <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> and beast move, that a guard's bullet <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> amiss.
I mustered all my will force, bellowed fiercely, and landed a final
concussive blow. The tiger collapsed and lay quietly.

"Like a pussycat!" I interjected.

The swami laughed in hearty appreciation, then continued the
engrossing tale.

"Raja Begum was vanquished at last. His royal pride was further
humbled: with my lacerated hands, I audaciously forced open his
jaws. For a dramatic moment, I held my head <span class="t5 t7 hoverable">within</span> the yawning
deathtrap. I looked around for a chain. Pulling <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> from a pile
on the floor, I bound the tiger by his neck to the cage bars. In
triumph I moved toward the door.

"But that fiend incarnate, Raja Begum, had stamina worthy of his
supposed demoniac origin. With an incredible lunge, he snapped
the chain and leaped on my back. My shoulder fast in his jaws, I
fell violently. But in a trice I had him pinned beneath me. Under
merciless blows, the treacherous animal sank into semiconsciousness.
This <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> I secured him more carefully. Slowly I left the cage.

"I <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> myself in a <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> uproar, this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of delight. The crowd's
cheer broke as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> from a single gigantic throat. Disastrously
mauled, I had <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> fulfilled the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> conditions of the fight-stunning
the tiger, binding him with a chain, and leaving him <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span>
requiring assistance for myself. In addition, I had so drastically
injured and frightened the aggressive beast that he had been content
to overlook the opportune prize of my head in his mouth!

"After my wounds were treated, I was honored and garlanded; hundreds of
gold pieces showered at my feet. The <span class="t3 t5 t7 t9 t20 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t22 t23 hoverable">city</span> entered a holiday
period. Endless discussions were heard on all sides about my
victory over <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of the largest and most savage tigers <span class="t29 hoverable">ever</span> seen.
Raja Begum was presented to me, as promised, but I felt no elation.
A <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> change had entered my heart. It seemed that with my
final exit from the cage I had <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> closed the door on my worldly
ambitions.

"A woeful period followed. For six months I lay near <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> from
blood poisoning. As soon as I was <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t8 t10 t12 t13 t14 t17 t19 t23 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> enough to leave Cooch Behar,
I returned to my native town.

"'I <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">know</span> now that my teacher is the <span class="t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t12 t15 t19 t20 t23 t25 hoverable">holy</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> who gave the wise
warning.' I humbly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> this confession to my father. 'Oh, if I
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> only find him!' My longing was sincere, for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> the saint
arrived unheralded.

"'Enough of tiger taming.' He spoke with calm assurance. 'Come with
me; I will teach you to subdue the beasts of ignorance roaming in
jungles of the <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> mind. You are <span class="t27 hoverable">used</span> to an audience: <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">let</span> it be
a galaxy of angels, entertained by your thrilling mastery of yoga!'

"I was initiated into the <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> path by my saintly guru. He
opened my soul-doors, rusty and resistant with <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> disuse. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t29 hoverable">Hand</span>
in hand, we soon <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t15 t17 t18 t19 hoverable">set</span> out for my training in the Himalayas."

Chandi and I bowed at the swami's feet, grateful for his vivid
outline of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> truly cyclonic. I felt amply repaid for the <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span>
probationary wait in the cold parlor!

{FN6-1} SOHONG was his monastic name. He was popularly <span class="t6 t10 t15 hoverable">known</span> as
the "Tiger Swami."

{FN6-2} "Prince Princess"-so named to indicate that this beast
possessed the combined ferocity of tiger and tigress.

CHAPTER: 7

THE LEVITATING SAINT

"I saw a yogi remain in the air, several feet above the ground,
last night at a group meeting." My friend, Upendra Mohun Chowdhury,
spoke impressively.

I gave him an enthusiastic smile. "Perhaps I can guess his name.
Was it Bhaduri Mahasaya, of Upper Circular Road?"

Upendra nodded, a little crestfallen not to be a news-bearer. My
inquisitiveness about saints was well-known <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span> my friends; they
delighted in setting me on a fresh track.

"The yogi lives so close to my home that I often visit him." My
<span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">words</span> <span class="t2 t4 t5 t22 t23 hoverable">brought</span> keen interest to Upendra's face, and I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> a further
confidence.

"I have seen him in remarkable feats. He has expertly mastered the
various PRANAYAMAS {FN7-1} of the ancient eightfold yoga outlined
by Patanjali. {FN7-2} Once Bhaduri Mahasaya performed the BHASTRIKA
PRANAYAMA before me with such amazing force that it seemed an actual
storm had arisen in the room! Then he extinguished the thundering
breath and remained motionless in a high state of superconsciousness.
{FN7-3} The aura of peace after the storm was vivid beyond forgetting."

"I heard that the saint <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> leaves his home." Upendra's tone was

a trifle incredulous.

"Indeed it is true! He has lived indoors for the past twenty years.
He slightly relaxes his self-imposed rule at the times of our <span class="t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t12 t15 t19 t20 t23 t25 hoverable">holy</span>
festivals, when he goes as <span class="t6 t9 t18 t26 hoverable">far</span> as his front sidewalk! The beggars
gather there, because Saint Bhaduri is <span class="t6 t10 t15 hoverable">known</span> for his tender heart."

"How does he remain in the air, defying the <span class="t0 t8 t12 t15 t19 t23 t25 hoverable">law</span> of gravitation?"

"A yogi's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> loses its grossness after use of <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> PRANAYAMAS.
Then it will levitate or hop about <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> a leaping frog. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Even</span>
saints who do not practice a formal yoga {FN7-4} have been <span class="t6 t10 t15 hoverable">known</span>
to levitate during a state of intense devotion to God."

"I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> to <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">know</span> more of this sage. Do you attend his evening
meetings?" Upendra's eyes were sparkling with curiosity.

"Yes, I go often. I am vastly entertained by the wit in his
wisdom. Occasionally my prolonged laughter mars the solemnity of
his gatherings. The saint is not displeased, but his disciples look
daggers!"

On my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> home from school that afternoon, I passed Bhaduri Mahasaya's
cloister and decided on a visit. The yogi was inaccessible to the
general public. A lone disciple, occupying the ground floor, guarded

his master's privacy. The student was something of a martinet; he
now inquired formally if I had an "engagement." His guru <span class="t0 t2 t16 t18 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">put</span> in an
appearance just in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> to save me from summary ejection.

"Let Mukunda <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> when he will." The sage's eyes twinkled. "My rule
of seclusion is not for my own comfort, but for that of others.
Worldly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> do not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> the candor which shatters their delusions.
Saints are not only rare but disconcerting. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Even</span> in scripture, they
are often <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> embarrassing!"

I followed Bhaduri Mahasaya to his austere quarters on the top floor,
from which he seldom stirred. Masters often ignore the panorama
of the world's ado, out of focus till centered in the ages. The
contemporaries of a sage are not alone those of the narrow present.

"Maharishi, {FN7-5} you are the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> yogi I have <span class="t6 t10 t15 hoverable">known</span> who always
stays indoors."

"God plants his saints sometimes in unexpected soil, lest we think
we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> reduce Him to a rule!"

The sage locked his vibrant <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> in the lotus posture. In his
seventies, he displayed no unpleasing signs of age or sedentary life.
Stalwart and straight, he was ideal in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> respect. His face was
that of a RISHI, as described in the ancient texts. Noble-headed,

abundantly bearded, he always sat firmly upright, his quiet eyes
fixed on Omnipresence.

The saint and I entered the meditative state. After an hour, his
gentle voice roused me.

"You go often into the silence, but have you developed ANUBHAVA?"
{FN7-6} He was reminding me to <span class="t7 hoverable">love</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> more than meditation. "Do
not mistake the technique for the Goal."

He offered me some mangoes. With that good-humored wit that I <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span>
so delightful in his grave nature, he remarked, "People in general
are more fond of JALA YOGA (union with food) than of DHYANA YOGA
(union with God)."

His yogic pun affected me uproariously.

"What a laugh you have!" An affectionate gleam <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> into his gaze.
His own face was always serious, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> touched with an ecstatic smile.
His large, lotus eyes held a hidden <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> laughter.

"Those letters <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> from far-off America." The sage indicated several
thick envelopes on a table. "I correspond with a few societies
there <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whose</span> members are interested in yoga. They are discovering

"What RISHIS perceived as essential for <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> salvation need not

disciplinary yoga be not practiced."

The saint held me with his tranquil eyes. I did not realize that
his speech was a veiled prophetic guidance. It is only now, as I
write these words, that I understand the full <span class="t6 t13 t14 t25 t27 hoverable">meaning</span> in the casual
intimations he often gave me that someday I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> carry India's

I inquired, "why do you not write a <span class="t25 hoverable">book</span> on yoga for the benefit

"Maharishi, I wish you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> write a <span class="t25 hoverable">book</span> on yoga for the benefit

I remained alone with the yogi until his disciples arrived in the
evening. Bhaduri Mahasaya entered <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of his inimitable discourses.

This evening Bhaduri expounded various philosophical points

Several students <span class="t0 t2 t16 t18 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">put</span> rupees in Bhaduri's slippers which lay by his
side as he sat in yoga posture. This respectful offering, customary
in India, indicates that the disciple places his material goods at
the guru's feet. Grateful friends are only the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> in disguise,
looking after His own.

"Master, you are wonderful!" A student, taking his leave, gazed
ardently at the patriarchal sage. "You have renounced riches and
comforts to seek <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> and teach us wisdom!" It was well-known that
Bhaduri Mahasaya had forsaken <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> family wealth in his early
childhood, when single-mindedly he entered the yogic path.

"You are reversing the case!" The saint's face held a mild rebuke.
"I have left a few paltry rupees, a few petty pleasures, for a cosmic
empire of endless bliss. How then have I denied myself anything?
I <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">know</span> the joy of sharing the treasure. Is that a sacrifice? The
shortsighted worldly folk are verily the real renunciates! They
relinquish an unparalleled <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> possession for a poor handful of
earthly toys!"

I chuckled over this paradoxical view of renunciation-one which
puts the cap of Croesus on any saintly beggar, whilst transforming
all proud millionaires into unconscious martyrs.

"The <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> <span class="t0 t6 t7 t8 t11 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">order</span> arranges our future more wisely than any insurance

I continued my after-school pilgrimages to the saint's door. With
silent zeal he aided me to attain ANUBHAVA. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">One</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> he moved to

Although it throws me ahead of my story by a number of years, I
will recount here the last <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">words</span> <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> to me by Bhaduri Mahasaya.
Shortly before I embarked for the West, I sought him out and humbly
knelt for his farewell blessing:

"Son, go to America. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Take</span> the dignity of hoary India for your

to scientifically investigate the possibilities of the superconscious
mind. Professor Jules-Bois, member of the L'Ecole de Psychologie of
the Sorbonne, lectured in America in 1928; he told his audiences that
French scientists have accorded recognition to the superconsciousness,
"which is the exact opposite of Freud's subconscious <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> and is the

M.
Jules-Bois explained that the awakening of the higher consciousness
"was not to be confused with Coueism or hypnotism. The existence
of a superconscious <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> has <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> been recognized philosophically,

being in reality the Oversoul spoken of by Emerson, but only recently
has it been recognized scientifically." The French scientist pointed
out that from the superconsciousness <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> inspiration, genius, moral

CHAPTER: 8

INDIA'S <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">GREAT</span> SCIENTIST, J.C. BOSE

"Jagadis Chandra Bose's wireless inventions antedated those of
Marconi."

Overhearing this provocative remark, I walked closer to a sidewalk
group of professors engaged in scientific discussion. If my motive
in joining them was racial pride, I regret it. I <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">cannot</span> deny my
keen interest in evidence that India can play a leading <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> in
physics, and not metaphysics alone.

"What do you mean, sir?"

The professor obligingly explained. "Bose was the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> to invent
a wireless coherer and an instrument for indicating the refraction
of electric waves. But the Indian scientist did not exploit his
inventions commercially. He soon turned his attention from the
inorganic to the organic world. His revolutionary discoveries as a
plant physiologist are outpacing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> his radical achievements as
a physicist."

I politely thanked my mentor. He added, "The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> scientist is

I paid a visit the next <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> to the sage at his home, which was close
to mine on Gurpar Road. I had <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> admired him from a respectful
distance. The grave and retiring botanist greeted me graciously. He
was a handsome, robust <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> in his fifties, with thick hair, broad
forehead, and the abstracted eyes of a dreamer. The precision in
his tones revealed the lifelong scientific habit.

"I have recently returned from an expedition to scientific societies
of the West. Their members exhibited intense interest in delicate
instruments of my invention which demonstrate the indivisible unity
of all life. {FN8-1} The Bose crescograph has the enormity of ten
million magnifications. The microscope enlarges only a few thousand
times; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> it <span class="t2 t4 t5 t22 t23 hoverable">brought</span> vital impetus to biological science. The
crescograph opens incalculable vistas."

"You have done much, sir, to hasten the embrace of East and West
in the impersonal arms of science."

"I was educated at Cambridge. How admirable is the Western method
of submitting all theory to scrupulous experimental verification!
That empirical procedure has gone <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t29 hoverable">hand</span> in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t29 hoverable">hand</span> with the gift for
introspection which is my Eastern heritage. <span class="t16 t21 hoverable">Together</span> they have enabled
me to sunder the silences of natural realms <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> uncommunicative.
The telltale charts of my crescograph {FN8-2} are evidence for
the most skeptical that plants have a sensitive nervous system and
a varied emotional life. Love, hate, joy, fear, pleasure, pain,
excitability, stupor, and countless appropriate responses to stimuli
are as universal in plants as in animals."

"The unique throb of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> in all <span class="t14 hoverable">creation</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> seem only poetic

never pluck flowers. 'Shall I rob the rosebush of its pride in
beauty? <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Shall</span> I cruelly affront its dignity by my rude divestment?'
His sympathetic <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">words</span> are verified literally through your discoveries!"

"The poet is intimate with truth, while the scientist approaches
awkwardly. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Come</span> someday to my laboratory and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> the unequivocable
testimony of the crescograph."

Gratefully I accepted the invitation, and <span class="t4 hoverable">took</span> my departure. I
heard later that the botanist had left Presidency College, and was
planning a research center in Calcutta.

When the Bose Institute was opened, I attended the dedicatory
services. Enthusiastic hundreds strolled over the premises. I was
charmed with the artistry and <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> symbolism of the <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> home
of science. Its front gate, I noted, was a centuried relic from
a distant shrine. Behind the lotus {FN8-3} fountain, a sculptured
female figure with a torch conveyed the Indian respect for woman
as the immortal light-bearer. The garden held a small temple
consecrated to the Noumenon beyond phenomena. <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">Thought</span> of the <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span>

"I dedicate today this Institute as not merely a laboratory but
a temple." His reverent solemnity stole <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> an unseen cloak over
the crowded auditorium. "In the pursuit of my investigations I was
unconsciously led into the border region of physics and physiology.
To my amazement, I <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> boundary lines vanishing, and points
of contact emerging, between the realms of the living and the
non-living. Inorganic matter was perceived as anything but inert;
it was athrill under the action of multitudinous forces.

"A universal reaction seemed to <span class="t22 hoverable">bring</span> metal, plant and animal under
a common law. They all exhibited essentially the same phenomena
of fatigue and depression, with possibilities of recovery and of
exaltation, as <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t8 t10 t12 t13 t14 t17 t19 t23 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> as the permanent irresponsiveness associated
with death. Filled with awe at this stupendous generalization, it
was with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> hope that I announced my results before the Royal
Society--results demonstrated by experiments. But the physiologists
present advised me to confine myself to physical investigations, in
which my success had been assured, rather than encroach on their
preserves. I had unwittingly strayed into the domain of an unfamiliar
caste system and so offended its etiquette.

"An unconscious theological bias was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> present, which confounds

through unnumbered transformations. Indians have always arisen who,
discarding the immediate and absorbing prize of the hour, have
sought for the realization of the <span class="t6 t9 t22 t29 hoverable">highest</span> ideals in life-not through
passive renunciation, but through active struggle. The weakling
who has refused the conflict, acquiring nothing, has had <span class="t15 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">nothing</span>
to renounce. He alone who has striven and won can enrich the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span>

this I am attempting to carry on the traditions of my country. So

Tears stood in my eyes at the scientist's concluding words. Is
"patience" not indeed a synonym of India, confounding <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Time</span> and the

I visited the research center again, soon after the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> of opening.

laboratory.

"I will attach the crescograph to this fern; the magnification is
tremendous. If a snail's crawl were enlarged in the same proportion,
the creature <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> appear to be traveling <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> an express train!"

My gaze was fixed eagerly on the screen which reflected the magnified
fern-shadow. Minute life-movements were now clearly perceptible;
the plant was growing very slowly before my fascinated eyes. The
scientist touched the tip of the fern with a small metal bar. The
developing pantomime <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> to an abrupt halt, resuming the eloquent
rhythms as soon as the rod was withdrawn.

"You saw how any slight outside interference is detrimental to the
sensitive tissues," Bose remarked. "Watch; I will now administer
chloroform, and then <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> an antidote."

The effect of the chloroform discontinued all growth; the antidote
was revivifying. The evolutionary gestures on the screen held me
more raptly than a "movie" plot. My companion (here in the role
of villain) thrust a sharp instrument through a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of the fern;
pain was indicated by spasmodic flutters. When he passed a razor
partially through the stem, the shadow was violently agitated, then
stilled itself with the final punctuation of death.

"By <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> chloroforming a huge tree, I achieved a successful
transplantation. Usually, such monarchs of the forest die very
quickly after being moved." Jagadis smiled happily as he recounted
the life-saving maneuver. "Graphs of my delicate apparatus have
proved that trees possess a circulatory system; their sap movements

correspond to the blood pressure of animal bodies. The ascent of
sap is not explicable on the mechanical grounds ordinarily advanced,
such as capillary attraction. The phenomenon has been solved through
the crescograph as the activity of living cells. Peristaltic waves
issue from a cylindrical tube which extends down a tree and serves
as an actual heart! The more deeply we perceive, the more striking
becomes the evidence that a uniform plan links <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> in manifold

The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> scientist pointed to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">another</span> Bose instrument.

"I will show you experiments on a piece of tin. The life-force in
metals responds adversely or beneficially to stimuli. Ink markings
will register the various reactions."

Deeply engrossed, I watched the graph which recorded the characteristic
waves of atomic structure. When the professor applied chloroform
to the tin, the vibratory writings stopped. They recommenced as
the metal slowly regained its normal state. My companion dispensed
a poisonous chemical. Simultaneous with the quivering <span class="t7 t10 t15 t25 hoverable">end</span> of the
tin, the needle dramatically wrote on the chart a death-notice.

"Bose instruments have demonstrated that metals, such as the steel
<span class="t27 hoverable">used</span> in scissors and machinery, are subject to fatigue, and regain
efficiency by periodic rest. The life-pulse in metals is seriously

harmed or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> extinguished through the application of electric
currents or heavy pressure."

I looked around the room at the numerous inventions, eloquent
testimony of a tireless ingenuity.

"Sir, it is lamentable that mass agricultural development is
not speeded by fuller use of your marvelous mechanisms. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Would</span> it
not be easily possible to employ some of them in quick laboratory
experiments to indicate the influence of various types of fertilizers
on plant growth?"

"You are right. Countless uses of Bose instruments will be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span>
by future generations. The scientist seldom knows contemporaneous
reward; it is enough to possess the joy of creative service."

With expressions of unreserved gratitude to the indefatigable sage,
I <span class="t4 hoverable">took</span> my leave. "Can the astonishing fertility of his genius <span class="t29 hoverable">ever</span>
be exhausted?" I thought.

No diminution <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> with the years. Inventing an intricate instrument,
the "Resonant Cardiograph," Bose then pursued extensive researches
on innumerable Indian plants. An enormous unsuspected pharmacopoeia
of useful drugs was revealed. The cardiograph is constructed with
an unerring accuracy by which a one-hundredth <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of a <span class="t6 hoverable">second</span>

is indicated on a graph. Resonant records measure infinitesimal
pulsations in plant, animal and <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> structure. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> botanist
predicted that use of his cardiograph will lead to vivisection on
plants instead of animals.

"Side by side recordings of the effects of a medicine <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span>
simultaneously to a plant and an animal have shown astounding
unanimity in result," he pointed out. "Everything in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> has been
foreshadowed in the plant. Experimentation on vegetation will
contribute to lessening of <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> suffering."

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">Years</span> later Bose's pioneer plant findings were substantiated by other
scientists. <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t7 t10 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">Work</span> done in 1938 at Columbia University was reported
by THE <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">NEW</span> YORK TIMES as follows:

It has been determined <span class="t5 t7 hoverable">within</span> the past few <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span> that when the
nerves transmit messages between the brain and other parts of the
body, tiny electrical impulses are being generated. These impulses
have been measured by delicate galvanometers and magnified millions
of times by modern amplifying apparatus. Until now no satisfactory
method had been <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> to study the passages of the impulses along
the nerve fibers in living animals or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> because of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>
speed with which these impulses travel.

Drs. K. S. Cole and H. J. Curtis reported having discovered that the

long single cells of the fresh-water plant nitella, <span class="t27 hoverable">used</span> frequently
in goldfish bowls, are virtually identical with those of single
nerve fibers. Furthermore, they <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> that nitella fibers, on being
excited, propagate electrical waves that are similar in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> way,
except velocity, to those of the nerve fibers in animals and man.

slower than those in animals. This discovery was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> seized

CHAPTER: 9

THE BLISSFUL DEVOTEE AND HIS COSMIC ROMANCE

"Little sir, please be seated. I am talking to my <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Mother."

Silently I had entered the room in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> awe. The angelic
appearance of <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> Mahasaya fairly dazzled me. With silky white
beard and large lustrous eyes, he seemed an incarnation of purity.
His upraised chin and folded hands apprized me that my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> visit
had disturbed him in the midst of his devotions.

His simple <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">words</span> of greeting produced the most violent effect my
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> had so <span class="t6 t9 t18 t26 hoverable">far</span> experienced. The bitter separation of my mother's
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> I had <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> the measure of all anguish. Now an agony at
separation from my <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Mother was an indescribable torture of
the spirit. I fell moaning to the floor.

"Little sir, quiet yourself!" The saint was sympathetically
distressed.

Abandoned in some oceanic desolation, I clutched his feet as the
sole raft of my rescue.

"Holy sir, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thy</span> intercession! Ask <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Mother if I find any favor
in Her sight!"

This promise is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> not easily bestowed; the <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">master</span> was constrained
to silence.

Beyond reach of doubt, I was convinced that <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> Mahasaya was in
intimate converse with the Universal Mother. It was deep humiliation
to realize that my eyes were blind to Her who <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> at this moment
was perceptible to the faultless gaze of the saint. Shamelessly
gripping his feet, deaf to his gentle remonstrances, I besought
him again and again for his intervening grace.

"I will <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> your plea to the Beloved." The master's capitulation
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> with a slow, compassionate smile.

What <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> in those few words, that my being should <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">know</span> release
from its stormy exile?

"Sir, remember your pledge! I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> return soon for Her message!"
Joyful anticipation rang in my voice that only a moment ago had
been sobbing in sorrow.

Descending the <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> stairway, I was overwhelmed by memories. This
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> at 50 Amherst Street, now the residence of <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> Mahasaya,
had once been my family home, scene of my mother's death. Here
my <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t16 t19 t22 t23 t25 t26 hoverable">heart</span> had broken for the vanished mother; and here today
my <span class="t0 t1 t3 t5 t7 t8 t13 t16 t18 t20 t21 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> had been as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> crucified by absence of the <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span>
Mother. Hallowed walls, silent witness of my grievous hurts and
final healing!

My steps were eager as I returned to my Gurpar Road home. Seeking
the seclusion of my small attic, I remained in meditation until
ten o'clock. The darkness of the warm Indian night was suddenly
lit with a wondrous vision.

Haloed in splendor, the <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Mother stood before me. Her face,
tenderly smiling, was beauty itself.

"Always have I loved thee! <span class="t29 hoverable">Ever</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> I <span class="t7 hoverable">love</span> thee!"

The celestial tones still ringing in the air, She disappeared.

The <span class="t0 t8 t11 t14 t23 t25 t28 hoverable">sun</span> on the following morning had hardly risen to an angle of
decorum when I paid my <span class="t6 hoverable">second</span> visit to <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> Mahasaya. Climbing
the staircase in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> of poignant memories, I reached his
fourth-floor room. The knob of the closed door was wrapped around
with a cloth; a hint, I felt, that the saint desired privacy. As
I stood irresolutely on the landing, the door was opened by the
master's welcoming hand. I knelt at his <span class="t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t12 t15 t19 t20 t23 t25 hoverable">holy</span> feet. In a playful
mood, I wore a solemn mask over my face, hiding the <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> elation.

"Sir, I have come-very early, I confess!-for your message. Did the
Beloved Mother <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">say</span> anything about me?"

"Mischievous little sir!"

Not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">another</span> remark <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> he make. Apparently my assumed gravity
was unimpressive.

"Why so mysterious, so evasive? Do saints <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> speak plainly?"
Perhaps I was a little provoked.

"Must you test me?" His calm eyes were full of understanding. "Could
I add a single <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">word</span> this morning to the assurance you received last
night at ten o'clock from the Beautiful Mother Herself?"

<span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> Mahasaya possessed control over the flood-gates of my soul:

again I plunged prostrate at his feet. But this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> my tears welled
from a bliss, and not a pain, past bearing.

"Think you that your devotion did not touch the Infinite Mercy?
The Motherhood of God, that you have worshiped in forms both <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span>
and divine, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> fail to answer your forsaken cry."

Who was this simple saint, <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whose</span> least request to the Universal <span class="t0 t1 t3 t5 t7 t8 t13 t16 t18 t20 t21 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">Spirit</span>
met with sweet acquiescence? His role in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> was humble, as
befitted the greatest <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> of humility I <span class="t29 hoverable">ever</span> knew. In this Amherst
Street house, <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> Mahasaya {FN9-1} conducted a small high school
for boys. No <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">words</span> of chastisement passed his lips; no rule and
ferule maintained his discipline. Higher mathematics indeed were
taught in these modest classrooms, and a chemistry of <span class="t7 hoverable">love</span> absent
from the textbooks. He spread his wisdom by <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> contagion
rather than impermeable precept. Consumed by an unsophisticated
passion for the <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Mother, the saint no more demanded the
outward forms of respect than a child.

"I am not your guru; he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> a little later," he told me.
"Through his guidance, your experiences of the <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> in terms of

sought <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> Mahasaya's <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> cup, so full that its drops daily
overflowed on my being. <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">Never</span> before had I bowed in utter reverence;
now I felt it an immeasurable privilege <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> to tread the same
ground which <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> Mahasaya sanctified.

"Sir, please wear this champak garland I have fashioned especially
for you." I arrived <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> evening, holding my chain of flowers. But
shyly he drew away, repeatedly refusing the honor. Perceiving my
hurt, he finally smiled consent.

"Since we are both devotees of the Mother, you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> <span class="t0 t2 t16 t18 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">put</span> the garland
on this bodily temple, as offering to Her who dwells within." His
vast <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> lacked space in which any egotistical consideration

"Let us go tomorrow to the Dakshineswar Temple, forever hallowed
by my guru." <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> Mahasaya was a disciple of a Christlike master,
Sri Ramakrishna Paramhansa.

The four-mile journey on the following morning was <span class="t19 hoverable">taken</span> by boat
on the Ganges. We entered the nine-domed Temple of Kali, where the
figures of the <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Mother and Shiva rest on a burnished silver
lotus, its thousand petals meticulously chiseled. <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> Mahasaya
beamed in enchantment. He was engaged in his inexhaustible romance
with the Beloved. As he chanted Her name, my enraptured <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t16 t19 t22 t23 t25 t26 hoverable">heart</span> seemed
shattered into a thousand pieces.

We strolled later through the sacred precincts, halting in a
tamarisk grove. The manna characteristically exuded by this tree
was symbolic of the heavenly food <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> Mahasaya was bestowing.
His <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> invocations continued. I sat rigidly motionless on the
grass amid the pink feathery tamarisk flowers. Temporarily absent
from the body, I soared in a supernal visit.

This was the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> pilgrimages to Dakshineswar with the <span class="t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t12 t15 t19 t20 t23 t25 hoverable">holy</span>
teacher. From him I learned the sweetness of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> in the aspect of
Mother, or <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Mercy. The childlike saint <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> little appeal in
the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t28 hoverable">Father</span> aspect, or <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Justice. Stern, exacting, mathematical
judgment was alien to his gentle nature.

"He can serve as an earthly prototype for the very angels of
heaven!" I <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> fondly, watching him <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> at his prayers.
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Without</span> a breath of censure or criticism, he surveyed the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span>
with eyes <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> familiar with the Primal Purity. His body, mind,

speech, and actions were effortlessly harmonized with his soul's
simplicity.

"My <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> told me so." Shrinking from personal assertion, the
saint ended any sage counsel with this invariable tribute. So deep
was his identity with Sri Ramakrishna that <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> Mahasaya no longer
considered his thoughts as his own.

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t29 hoverable">Hand</span> in hand, the saint and I walked <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> evening on the block of his
school. My joy was dimmed by the arrival of a conceited acquaintance
who burdened us with a lengthy discourse.

"I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> doesn't please you." The saint's whisper to me was
unheard by the egotist, spellbound by his own monologue. "I have
spoken to <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Mother about it; She realizes our sad predicament.
As soon as we get to yonder red house, She has promised to remind
him of more urgent business."

My eyes were glued to the site of salvation. Reaching its red gate,
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> unaccountably turned and departed, <span class="t4 t18 t22 hoverable">neither</span> finishing his
sentence nor <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t9 t11 t12 t15 t16 t17 t22 t24 t27 hoverable">saying</span> good-by. The assaulted air was comforted with
peace.

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Another</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> me walking alone near the Howrah railway station.
I stood for a moment by a temple, silently criticizing a small group

of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> with drum and cymbals who were violently reciting a chant.

"How undevotionally they use the Lord's <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> in mechanical
repetition," I reflected. My gaze was astonished by the rapid
approach of <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> Mahasaya. "Sir, how <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> you here?"

The saint, ignoring my question, answered my thought. "Isn't it
true, little sir, that the Beloved's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> sounds sweet from all
lips, ignorant or wise?" He passed his arm around me affectionately;
I <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> myself carried on his magic carpet to the Merciful Presence.

"Would you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> some bioscopes?" This question <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> afternoon
from <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> Mahasaya was mystifying; the term was then <span class="t27 hoverable">used</span> in India
to signify motion pictures. I agreed, glad to be in his company in
any circumstances. A brisk walk <span class="t2 t4 t5 t22 t23 hoverable">brought</span> us to the garden fronting
Calcutta University. My companion indicated a bench near the GOLDIGHI
or pond.

"Let us sit here for a few minutes. My <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> always asked me
to meditate whenever I saw an expanse of water. Here its placidity
reminds us of the vast calmness of God. As all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> can be
reflected in water, so the <span class="t3 t5 t7 t9 t20 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> universe is mirrored in the lake
of the Cosmic Mind. So my GURUDEVA often said."

Soon we entered a university hall where a lecture was in progress.

It proved abysmally dull, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> varied occasionally by lantern
slide illustrations, equally uninteresting.

"So this is the kind of bioscope the <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">master</span> wanted me to see!" My
<span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> was impatient, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> not hurt the saint by revealing
boredom in my face. But he leaned toward me confidentially.

"I see, little sir, that you don't <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> this bioscope. I have
mentioned it to <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Mother; She is in full sympathy with us
both. She tells me that the electric lights will now go out, and
won't be relit until we have a chance to leave the room."

As his whisper ended, the hall was plunged into darkness. The
professor's strident voice was stilled in astonishment, then remarked,
"The electrical system of this hall appears to be defective." By
this time, <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> Mahasaya and I were safely across the threshold.
Glancing back from the corridor, I saw that the scene of our
martyrdom had again <span class="t8 t13 hoverable">become</span> illuminated.

"Little sir, you were disappointed in that bioscope, {FN9-2} but I
think you will <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> a <span class="t1 t2 t18 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">different</span> one." The saint and I were standing
on the sidewalk in front of the university building. He gently
slapped my chest over the heart.

A transforming silence ensued. Just as the modern "talkies" <span class="t8 t13 hoverable">become</span>

inaudible motion pictures when the sound apparatus goes out of
order, so the <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Hand, by some strange miracle, stifled the
earthly bustle. The pedestrians as <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t8 t10 t12 t13 t14 t17 t19 t23 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> as the passing trolley cars,
automobiles, bullock carts, and iron-wheeled hackney carriages were
all in noiseless transit. As <span class="t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> possessing an omnipresent eye,
I beheld the scenes which were behind me, and to each side, as
easily as those in front. The <span class="t3 t5 t7 t9 t20 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> spectacle of activity in that
small section of Calcutta passed before me <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> a sound. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Like</span>
a glow of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> dimly seen beneath a thin coat of ashes, a mellow
luminescence permeated the panoramic view.

My own <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> seemed <span class="t15 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">nothing</span> more than <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> shadows,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> it was motionless, while the <span class="t1 t7 t13 hoverable">others</span> flitted mutely to and
fro. Several boys, friends of mine, approached and passed on; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span>
they had looked directly at me, it was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> recognition.

The unique pantomime <span class="t2 t4 t5 t22 t23 hoverable">brought</span> me an inexpressible ecstasy. I drank
deep from some blissful fount. Suddenly my chest received <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">another</span>
soft blow from <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> Mahasaya. The pandemonium of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> burst
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> my unwilling ears. I staggered, as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> harshly awakened
from a gossamer dream. The transcendental wine removed beyond my
reach.

"Little sir, I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> you <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> the <span class="t6 hoverable">second</span> bioscope to your liking."
The saint was smiling; I started to drop in gratitude on the ground

before him. "You can't do that to me now; you <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">know</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> is in your
temple also! I won't <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">let</span> <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Mother touch my feet through your
hands!"

If anyone observed the unpretentious <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">master</span> and myself as we walked
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">away</span> from the crowded pavement, the onlooker surely suspected

were sympathetically drunk with God. When darkness recovered from
its nightly swoon, I faced the <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> morning bereft of my ecstatic
mood. But <span class="t29 hoverable">ever</span> enshrined in memory is the seraphic <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> of <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span>

CHAPTER: 10

I MEET MY MASTER, SRI YUKTESWAR

"Faith in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> can produce any miracle except one-passing an

picked up in an idle moment.

"The writer's exception shows his complete lack of faith," I thought.
"Poor chap, he has <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> respect for the midnight oil!"

My promise to <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t28 hoverable">Father</span> had been that I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> complete my high school
studies. I <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">cannot</span> pretend to diligence. The passing months <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> me
less frequently in the classroom than in secluded spots along the
Calcutta bathing GHATS. The adjoining crematory grounds, especially
gruesome at night, are considered highly attractive by the yogi.
He who <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> find the Deathless Essence <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> not be dismayed by a

abode of miscellaneous bones. My midnight vigils were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> of a

The week of final examinations at the Hindu High School was fast
approaching. This interrogatory period, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> the sepulchral haunts,
inspires a well-known terror. My <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> was nevertheless at peace.
Braving the ghouls, I was exhuming a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> not <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> in lecture
halls. But it lacked the art of Swami Pranabananda, who easily
appeared in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> places at <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> time. My educational dilemma was
plainly a matter for the Infinite Ingenuity. This was my reasoning,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> it seems illogic. The devotee's irrationality springs
from a thousand inexplicable demonstrations of God's instancy in
trouble.

"Hello, Mukunda! I catch hardly a glimpse of you these days!" A
classmate accosted me <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> afternoon on Gurpar Road.

"Hello, Nantu! My invisibility at school has actually placed me
there in a decidedly awkward position." I unburdened myself under
his friendly gaze.

Nantu, who was a brilliant student, laughed heartily; my predicament
was not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> a comic aspect.

"You are utterly unprepared for the finals! I suppose it is up to
me to help you!"

The simple <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">words</span> conveyed <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> promise to my ears; with alacrity
I visited my friend's home. He kindly outlined the solutions to
various problems he considered likely to be <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t15 t17 t18 t19 hoverable">set</span> by the instructors.

"These questions are the bait which will catch <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> trusting boys
in the examination trap. Remember my answers, and you will escape

The night was <span class="t6 t9 t18 t26 hoverable">far</span> gone when I departed. Bursting with unseasoned
erudition, I devoutly prayed it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> remain for the next few
critical days. Nantu had coached me in my various subjects but,
under press of time, had forgotten my course in Sanskrit. Fervently
I reminded <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> of the oversight.

I <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t15 t17 t18 t19 hoverable">set</span> out on a short walk the next morning, assimilating my <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span>
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> to the rhythm of swinging footsteps. As I <span class="t4 hoverable">took</span> a short
cut through the weeds of a corner lot, my eye fell on a few loose
printed sheets. A triumphant pounce proved them to be Sanskrit verse.
I sought out a pundit for aid in my stumbling interpretation. His
rich voice filled the air with the edgeless, honeyed beauty of the
ancient tongue. {FN10-1}

"These exceptional stanzas <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">cannot</span> possibly be of aid in your Sanskrit
test." The scholar dismissed them skeptically.

But familiarity with that particular poem enabled me on the following
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> to <span class="t5 hoverable">pass</span> the Sanskrit examination. Through the discerning help
Nantu had given, I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> attained the minimum grade for success in
all my other subjects.

<span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t28 hoverable">Father</span> was pleased that I had kept my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">word</span> and concluded my secondary
school course. My gratitude sped to the Lord, <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whose</span> sole guidance
I perceived in my visit to Nantu and my walk by the unhabitual route
of the debris-filled lot. Playfully He had <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> a dual expression
to His timely design for my rescue.

I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> across the discarded <span class="t25 hoverable">book</span> <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whose</span> author had denied <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span>
precedence in the examination halls. I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> not restrain a chuckle
at my own silent comment:

"It <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> only add to this fellow's confusion, if I were to tell
him that <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> meditation <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span> the cadavers is a short cut to a

In my <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> dignity, I was now openly planning to leave home. <span class="t16 t21 hoverable">Together</span>
with a young friend, Jitendra Mazumdar, {FN10-2} I decided to join a
Mahamandal hermitage in Benares, and receive its <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> discipline.

A desolation fell over me <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> morning at <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> of separation from
my family. Since Mother's death, my affection had grown especially

tender for my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> younger brothers, Sananda and Bishnu. I rushed
to my retreat, the little attic which had witnessed so <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> scenes
in my turbulent SADHANA. {FN10-3} After a two-hour flood of tears,
I felt singularly transformed, as by some alchemical cleanser. All
attachment {FN10-4} disappeared; my resolution to seek <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> as the

I quickly completed
my travel preparations.

"I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> last plea." <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t28 hoverable">Father</span> was distressed as I stood before him
for final blessing. "Do not forsake me and your grieving brothers
and sisters."

"Revered Father, how can I tell my <span class="t7 hoverable">love</span> for you! But <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> greater
is my <span class="t7 hoverable">love</span> for the Heavenly Father, who has <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> me the gift of
a perfect <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t28 hoverable">father</span> on earth. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Let</span> me go, that I someday return with
a more <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> understanding."

With reluctant parental consent, I <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t15 t17 t18 t19 hoverable">set</span> out to join Jitendra, already
in Benares at the hermitage. On my arrival the young head swami,
Dyananda, greeted me cordially. Tall and thin, of thoughtful mien,
he impressed me favorably. His fair face had a Buddhalike composure.

I was pleased that my <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> home possessed an attic, where I managed
to spend the dawn and morning hours. The ashram members, knowing
little of meditation practices, <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> I should employ my <span class="t3 t5 t7 t9 t20 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span>

time in organizational duties. They gave me praise for my afternoon

"Don't try to catch <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> so soon!" This ridicule from a fellow
resident accompanied <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of my early departures toward the attic. I

"Swamiji, {FN10-5} I don't understand what is required of me here.
I am seeking direct perception of God. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Without</span> Him, I <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">cannot</span> be

The orange-robed ecclesiastic gave me an affectionate pat. Staging
a mock rebuke, he admonished a few near-by disciples. "Don't bother
Mukunda. He will learn our ways."

I politely concealed my doubt. The students left the room, not overly
bent with their chastisement. Dyananda had further <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">words</span> for me.

"Mukunda, I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> your <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t28 hoverable">father</span> is regularly sending you money. Please
return it to him; you require none here. A <span class="t6 hoverable">second</span> injunction for
your discipline concerns food. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Even</span> when you feel hunger, don't
mention it."

Whether famishment gleamed in my eye, I knew not. That I was hungry,
I knew only too well. The invariable hour for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> hermitage

meal was twelve noon. I had been accustomed in my own home to a
large breakfast at nine o'clock.

The three-hour gap became daily more interminable. Gone were the
Calcutta <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span> when I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> rebuke the cook for a ten-minute delay.
Now I tried to control my appetite; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> I undertook a twenty-four
hour fast. With double zest I awaited the following midday.

"Dyanandaji's train is late; we are not going to eat until he
arrives." Jitendra <span class="t2 t4 t5 t22 t23 hoverable">brought</span> me this devastating news. As gesture
of welcome to the swami, who had been absent for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> weeks, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span>
delicacies were in readiness. An appetizing aroma filled the air.
<span class="t15 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">Nothing</span> else offering, what else <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> be swallowed except pride
over yesterday's achievement of a fast?

"Lord hasten the train!" The Heavenly Provider, I thought, was hardly
included in the interdiction with which Dyananda had silenced me.
<span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Attention was elsewhere, however; the plodding clock covered
the hours. Darkness was descending as our leader entered the door.
My greeting was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of unfeigned joy.

"Dyanandaji will bathe and meditate before we can serve food."
Jitendra approached me again as a bird of ill omen.

I was in near-collapse. My young stomach, <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> to deprivation,

protested with gnawing vigor. Pictures I had seen of famine victims
passed wraithlike before me.

"The next Benares <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> from starvation is due at once in this
hermitage," I thought. Impending doom averted at nine o'clock.
Ambrosial summons! In memory that meal is vivid as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of life's
perfect hours.

Intense absorption <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> permitted me to observe that Dyananda ate
absent-mindedly. He was apparently above my gross pleasures.

"Swamiji, weren't you hungry?" Happily surfeited, I was alone with
the leader in his study.

"O yes! I have spent the last four <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t11 t20 t26 t27 hoverable">days</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> food or drink.
I <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> eat on trains, filled with the heterogenous vibrations of
worldly people. Strictly I observe the SHASTRIC {FN10-6} rules for
monks of my particular order.

"Certain problems of our organizational <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t7 t10 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> lie on my mind.
Tonight at home I neglected my dinner. What's the hurry? Tomorrow
I'll <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> it a point to have a proper meal." He laughed merrily.

Shame spread <span class="t5 t7 hoverable">within</span> me <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> a suffocation. But the past <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> of my
torture was not easily forgotten; I ventured a further remark.

"Swamiji, I am puzzled. Following your instruction, suppose I <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span>
asked for food, and nobody gives me any. I should starve to death."

"Die then!" This alarming counsel split the air. "Die if you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span>

sustained! Do not imagine that rice maintains you, or that money
or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> support you! <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">Could</span> they aid if the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> withdraws your
life-breath? They are His indirect instruments merely. Is it by
any skill of yours that food digests in your stomach? Use the sword

and perceive the Single Cause!"

I <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> his incisive <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">words</span> entering some deep marrow. Gone was
an age-old delusion by which bodily imperatives outwit the soul.
There and then I tasted the Spirit's all-sufficiency. In how <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span>
strange cities, in my later <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of ceaseless travel, did occasion
arise to prove the serviceability of this lesson in a Benares
hermitage!

The sole treasure which had accompanied me from Calcutta was the
SADHU'S silver amulet bequeathed to me by Mother. Guarding it for
years, I now had it carefully hidden in my ashram room. To renew

my joy in the talismanic testimony, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> morning I opened the locked
box. The sealed covering untouched, lo! the amulet was gone.
Mournfully I tore open its envelope and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> unmistakably sure. It
had vanished, in accordance with the SADHU'S prediction, into the
ether whence he had summoned it.

My relationship with Dyananda's followers grew steadily worse. The
household was alienated, hurt by my determined aloofness. My strict
adherence to meditation on the very Ideal for which I had left
home and all worldly ambitions <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> <span class="t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t9 t10 t11 t13 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">forth</span> shallow criticism on
all sides.

Torn by <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> anguish, I entered the attic <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> dawn, resolved
to pray until answer was vouchsafed.

"Merciful Mother of the Universe, teach me Thyself through visions,
or through a guru sent by Thee!"

The passing hours <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> my sobbing pleas <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> response. Suddenly
I felt lifted as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> bodily to a sphere uncircumscribed.

"Thy <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> cometh today!" A <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> womanly voice <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> from everywhere
and nowhere.

This supernal experience was pierced by a shout from a definite

locale. A young priest nicknamed Habu was calling me from the
downstairs kitchen.

"Mukunda, enough of meditation! You are needed for an errand."

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Another</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> I <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t18 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">might</span> have replied impatiently; now I wiped
my tear-swollen face and meekly obeyed the summons. <span class="t16 t21 hoverable">Together</span> Habu
and I <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t15 t17 t18 t19 hoverable">set</span> out for a distant market <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> in the Bengali section of
Benares. The ungentle Indian <span class="t0 t8 t11 t14 t23 t25 t28 hoverable">sun</span> was not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> at zenith as we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span>
our purchases in the bazaars. We pushed our <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> through the colorful
medley of housewives, guides, priests, simply-clad widows, dignified
Brahmins, and the ubiquitous <span class="t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t12 t15 t19 t20 t23 t25 hoverable">holy</span> bulls. Passing an inconspicuous
lane, I turned my head and surveyed the narrow length.

A Christlike <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> in the ocher robes of a swami stood motionless at
the <span class="t7 t10 t15 t25 hoverable">end</span> of the road. Instantly and anciently familiar he seemed;
my gaze fed hungrily for a trice. Then doubt assailed me.

"You are confusing this wandering monk with someone <span class="t6 t10 t15 hoverable">known</span> to you,"
I thought. "Dreamer, walk on."

After ten minutes, I felt heavy numbness in my feet. As <span class="t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span>
turned to stone, they were unable to carry me farther. Laboriously
I turned around; my feet regained normalcy. I faced the opposite
direction; again the curious weight oppressed me.

"The saint is magnetically drawing me to him!" With this thought,
I heaped my parcels into the arms of Habu. He had been observing
my erratic footwork with amazement, and now burst into laughter.

"What ails you? Are you crazy?"

My tumultuous emotion prevented any retort; I sped silently away.

Retracing my steps as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> wing-shod, I reached the narrow lane.
My quick glance revealed the quiet figure, steadily gazing in my
direction. A few eager steps and I was at his feet.

"Gurudeva!" {FN10-7} The <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> face was none other than he of my
thousand visions. These halcyon eyes, in leonine head with pointed
beard and flowing locks, had oft peered through gloom of my nocturnal
reveries, holding a promise I had not fully understood.

"O my own, you have <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> to me!" My guru uttered the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">words</span> again
and again in Bengali, his voice tremulous with joy. "How <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span>
I have waited for you!"

We entered a oneness of silence; <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">words</span> seemed the rankest
superfluities. Eloquence flowed in soundless chant from <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t16 t19 t22 t23 t25 t26 hoverable">heart</span> of
<span class="t6 t18 hoverable">master</span> to disciple. With an antenna of irrefragable insight I sensed

that my guru knew God, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> lead me to Him. The obscuration

Dramatic time! Past, present, and future are its cycling scenes.
This was not the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> <span class="t0 t8 t11 t14 t23 t25 t28 hoverable">sun</span> to find me at these <span class="t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t12 t15 t19 t20 t23 t25 hoverable">holy</span> feet!

Rana Mahal section of the city. His athletic figure moved with firm
tread. Tall, erect, about fifty-five at this time, he was active
and vigorous as a young man. His dark eyes were large, beautiful with
plumbless wisdom. Slightly curly hair softened a face of striking
power. Strength mingled subtly with gentleness.

As we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> our <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> to the stone balcony of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> overlooking the
Ganges, he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> affectionately:

"I will <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> you my hermitages and all I possess."

"Sir, I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> for wisdom and God-contact. Those are your treasure-troves
I am after!"

The swift Indian twilight had dropped its half-curtain before my
<span class="t6 t18 hoverable">master</span> spoke again. His eyes held unfathomable tenderness.

"I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> you my unconditional love."

Precious words! A quarter-century elapsed before I had <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">another</span>
auricular proof of his love. His lips were strange to ardor; silence
became his oceanic heart.

"Will you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> me the same unconditional love?" He gazed at me with
childlike trust.

"I will <span class="t7 hoverable">love</span> you eternally, Gurudeva!"

"Ordinary <span class="t7 hoverable">love</span> is selfish, darkly rooted in desires and satisfactions.
<span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> <span class="t7 hoverable">love</span> is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> condition, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> boundary, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> change.
The flux of the <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t16 t19 t22 t23 t25 t26 hoverable">heart</span> is gone forever at the transfixing touch
of pure love." He added humbly, "If <span class="t29 hoverable">ever</span> you find me falling from
a state of God-realization, please promise to <span class="t0 t2 t16 t18 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">put</span> my head on your
lap and help to <span class="t22 hoverable">bring</span> me back to the Cosmic Beloved we both worship."

He rose then in the gathering darkness and guided me to an inner
room. As we ate mangoes and almond sweetmeats, he unobtrusively
wove into his conversation an intimate <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of my nature. I
was awe-struck at the grandeur of his wisdom, exquisitely blended
with an innate humility.

"Do not grieve for your amulet. It has served its purpose." <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Like</span>
a <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> mirror, my guru apparently had caught a reflection of my
<span class="t3 t5 t7 t9 t20 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> life.

"The living reality of your presence, Master, is joy beyond any
symbol."

"It is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> for a change, inasmuch as you are unhappily situated
in the hermitage."

I had <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> no references to my life; they now seemed superfluous!
By his natural, unemphatic manner, I understood that he wished no
astonished ejaculations at his clairvoyance.

"You should go back to Calcutta. Why exclude relatives from your
<span class="t7 hoverable">love</span> of humanity?"

His suggestion dismayed me. My family was predicting my return,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> I had been unresponsive to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> pleas by letter. "Let the
young bird fly in the metaphysical skies," Ananta had remarked.
"His wings will tire in the heavy atmosphere. We <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> him
swoop toward home, fold his pinions, and humbly rest in our family
nest." This discouraging simile fresh in my mind, I was determined
to do no "swooping" in the direction of Calcutta.

"Sir, I am not returning home. But I will follow you anywhere.
Please <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> me your address, and your name."

"Swami Sri Yukteswar Giri. My chief hermitage is in Serampore, on
Rai Ghat Lane. I am visiting my mother here for only a few days."

I wondered at God's intricate play with His devotees. Serampore is
but twelve miles from Calcutta, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> in those regions I had <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span>
caught a glimpse of my guru. We had had to travel for our meeting
to the ancient <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t22 t23 hoverable">city</span> of Kasi (Benares), hallowed by memories of
Lahiri Mahasaya. Here too the feet of Buddha, Shankaracharya and
other Yogi--Christs had blessed the soil.

"You will <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> to me in four weeks." For the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> time, Sri
Yukteswar's voice was stern. "Now I have told my eternal affection,
and have shown my happiness at finding you-that is why you disregard
my request. The next <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> we meet, you will have to reawaken my
interest: I won't accept you as a disciple easily. There <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> be
complete surrender by obedience to my strict training."

I remained obstinately silent. My guru easily penetrated my
difficulty.

"Do you think your relatives will laugh at you?"

"I will not return."

"You will return in thirty days."

"Never." Bowing reverently at his feet, I departed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> lightening
the controversial tension. As I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> in the midnight darkness,
I wondered why the miraculous meeting had ended on an inharmonious
note. The dual scales of MAYA, that balance <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> joy with a grief!
My young <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t16 t19 t22 t23 t25 t26 hoverable">heart</span> was not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> malleable to the transforming fingers
of my guru.

The next morning I noticed increased hostility in the attitude
of the hermitage members. My <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t11 t20 t26 t27 hoverable">days</span> became spiked with invariable
rudeness. In <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> weeks, Dyananda left the ashram to attend a
conference in Bombay; pandemonium broke over my hapless head.

"Mukunda is a parasite, accepting hermitage hospitality <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span>
making proper return." Overhearing this remark, I regretted for the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> that I had obeyed the request to send back my money to
Father. With heavy heart, I sought out my sole friend, Jitendra.

"I am leaving. Please convey my respectful regrets to Dyanandaji
when he returns."

"I will leave also! My attempts to meditate here meet with no more
favor than your own." Jitendra spoke with determination.

"I have met a Christlike saint. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Let</span> us visit him in Serampore."

And so the "bird" prepared to "swoop" perilously close to Calcutta!

{FN10-1} SANSKRITA, polished; complete. Sanskrit is the eldest

epic poems, the MAHABHARATA and the RAMAYANA. PURANAS are literally
"ancient" allegories; TANTRAS literally mean "rites" or "rituals";
these treatises convey profound truths under a veil of detailed
symbolism.

was assaulting my ears.

Jitendra and I, fresh from the train (a figure of speech merely;
we were covered with dust), had just arrived at the home of Ananta,
recently transferred from Calcutta to the ancient <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t22 t23 hoverable">city</span> of Agra.
Brother was a supervising accountant for the Bengal-Nagpur Railway.

My retort was summoned by the exigencies of the moment, and held
no presentiment. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> the leaves of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> unfolded to early finality

<span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t16 t19 t22 t23 t25 t26 hoverable">heart</span> had been longing for! You <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be sure it was not your pundit

or his son!"

Ananta joined me in reminiscent laughter; he had had to admit that
the Benares "clairvoyant" he selected was a shortsighted one.

"What are your plans, my wandering brother?"

"Jitendra persuaded me to Agra. We <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> view the beauties of the
Taj Mahal {FN11-2} here," I explained. "Then we are going to my
newly-found guru, who has a hermitage in Serampore."

Ananta hospitably arranged for our comfort. Several times during
the evening I noticed his eyes fixed on me reflectively.

"I <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">know</span> that look!" I thought. "A plot is brewing!"

The denouement <span class="t4 hoverable">took</span> <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> during our early breakfast.

"So you feel quite independent of Father's wealth." Ananta's gaze
was innocent as he resumed the barbs of yesterday's conversation.

"I am conscious of my dependence on God."

"Words are cheap! <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Life</span> has shielded you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> far! What a plight
if you were forced to look to the Invisible <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t29 hoverable">Hand</span> for your food and

"Never! I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> not <span class="t0 t2 t16 t18 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">put</span> faith in passers-by rather than God! He can
devise for His devotee a thousand resources besides the begging-bowl!"

"More rhetoric! Suppose I suggest that your vaunted philosophy be
<span class="t0 t2 t16 t18 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">put</span> to a test in this tangible world?"

"I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> agree!

"We <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> see; today you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> have opportunity either to enlarge
or to confirm my own views!" Ananta paused for a dramatic moment;
then spoke slowly and seriously.

"I propose that I send you and your fellow disciple Jitendra this
morning to the near-by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t22 t23 hoverable">city</span> of Brindaban.

to my bungalow here before twelve o'clock tonight, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> having

Agra!"

"I accept the challenge." No hesitation was in my <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">words</span> or in

my heart. Grateful memories flashed of the Instant Beneficence:
my healing of deadly cholera through appeal to Lahiri Mahasaya's
picture; the playful gift of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> kites on the Lahore roof with
Uma; the opportune amulet amidst my discouragement; the decisive
message through the unknown Benares SADHU outside the compound of
the pundit's home; the vision of <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Mother and Her majestic
<span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">words</span> of love; Her swift heed through <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> Mahasaya to my trifling
embarrassments; the last-minute guidance which materialized my
high school diploma; and the ultimate boon, my living <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> from
the mist of lifelong dreams. <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">Never</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> I admit my "philosophy"
unequal to any tussle on the world's harsh proving ground!

"Your willingness does you credit. I'll escort you to the train
at once." Ananta turned to the openmouthed Jitendra. "You <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> go
along as a witness and, very likely, a fellow victim!"

A half hour later Jitendra and I were in possession of one-way
tickets for our impromptu trip. We submitted, in a secluded corner
of the station, to a search of our persons. Ananta was quickly
satisfied that we were carrying no hidden hoard; our simple DHOTIS
{FN11-3} concealed <span class="t15 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">nothing</span> more than was necessary.

As faith invaded the serious realms of finance, my friend spoke
protestingly. "Ananta, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> me <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> rupees as a safeguard.
Then I can telegraph you in case of misfortune."

"Jitendra!" My ejaculation was sharply reproachful. "I will not
proceed with the test if you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">take</span> any money as final security."

"There is something reassuring about the clink of coins." Jitendra
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> no more as I regarded him sternly.

"Mukunda, I am not heartless." A hint of humility had crept into
Ananta's voice. It <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be that his conscience was smiting him;
perhaps for sending <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> insolvent boys to a strange city; perhaps
for his own religious skepticism. "If by any chance or grace you
<span class="t5 hoverable">pass</span> successfully through the Brindaban ordeal, I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> ask you to
initiate me as your disciple."

This promise had a <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> irregularity, in keeping with the
unconventional occasion. The eldest brother in an Indian family
seldom bows before his juniors; he receives respect and obedience
<span class="t6 hoverable">second</span> only to a father. But no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> remained for my comment; our
train was at point of departure.

Jitendra maintained a lugubrious silence as our train covered the
miles. Finally he bestirred himself; leaning over, he pinched me
painfully at an awkward spot.

"I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> no sign that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> is going to supply our next meal!"

"Be quiet, doubting Thomas; the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> is working with us."

"Can you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> arrange that He hurry? Already I am famished merely
at the prospect before us. I left Benares to view the Taj's mausoleum,
not to enter my own!"

"Cheer up, Jitendra! Are we not to have our <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> glimpse of the
sacred wonders of Brindaban? {FN11-4} I am in deep joy at <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span>
of treading the ground hallowed by feet of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> Krishna."

The door of our compartment opened; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> seated themselves. The
next train stop <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be the last.

"Young lads, do you have friends in Brindaban?" The stranger opposite
me was taking a surprising interest.

"None of your business!" Rudely I averted my gaze.

"You are probably flying <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">away</span> from your families under the enchantment
of the Stealer of Hearts. {FN11-5} I am of devotional temperament
myself. I will <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> it my positive duty to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> that you receive
food, and shelter from this overpowering heat."

"No, sir, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">let</span> us alone. You are very kind; but you are mistaken in

judging us to be truants from home."

No further conversation ensued; the train <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> to a halt. As Jitendra
and I descended to the platform, our chance companions linked arms
with us and summoned a horse cab.

We alit before a stately hermitage, <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t15 t17 t18 t19 hoverable">set</span> amidst the evergreen trees
of well-kept grounds. Our benefactors were evidently <span class="t6 t10 t15 hoverable">known</span> here; a
smiling lad led us <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> comment to a parlor. We were soon joined
by an elderly woman of dignified bearing.

"Gauri Ma, the princes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> not come." <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">One</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> addressed
the ashram hostess. "At the last moment their plans <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> awry; they
send deep regrets. But we have <span class="t2 t4 t5 t22 t23 hoverable">brought</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> other guests. As soon
as we met on the train, I felt drawn to them as devotees of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span>

if my cooking had <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> none to appreciate it!"

These appetizing <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">words</span> had disastrous effect on Jitendra: he burst
into tears. The "prospect" he had feared in Brindaban was turning
out as royal entertainment; his sudden mental adjustment proved
too <span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">much</span> for him. Our hostess looked at him with curiosity, but
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> remark; perhaps she was familiar with adolescent quirks.

Lunch was announced; Gauri Ma led the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> to a dining patio, spicy
with savory odors. She vanished into an adjoining kitchen.

I had been premeditating this moment. Selecting the appropriate
spot on Jitendra's anatomy, I administered a pinch as resounding
as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> he had <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> me on the train.

"Doubting Thomas, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> works-in a hurry, too!"

The hostess reentered with a PUNKHA. She steadily fanned us in the
Oriental fashion as we squatted on ornate blanket-seats. Ashram
disciples passed to and fro with some thirty courses. Rather than
"meal," the description can only be "sumptuous repast." Since
arriving on this planet, Jitendra and I had <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> before tasted
such delicacies.

"Dishes fit for princes indeed, Honored Mother! What your royal
patrons <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> have <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> more urgent than attending this banquet,
I <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">cannot</span> imagine! You have <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> us a memory for a lifetime!"

Silenced as we were by Ananta's requirement, we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> not explain
to the gracious lady that our thanks held a double significance.
Our sincerity at least was patent. We departed with her blessing
and an attractive invitation to revisit the hermitage.

The heat outdoors was merciless. My friend and I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> for the
shelter of a lordly cadamba tree at the ashram gate. Sharp <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">words</span>
followed; once again Jitendra was beset with misgivings.

"A fine mess you have got me into! Our luncheon was only accidental
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> fortune! How can we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> the sights of this city, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> a

single pice between us? And how on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> are you going to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">take</span> me
back to Ananta's?"

"You forget <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> quickly, now that your stomach is filled." My words,
not bitter, were accusatory. How short is <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> memory for <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span>
favors! No <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> lives who has not seen <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> of his prayers granted.

"I am not likely to forget my folly in venturing out with a madcap
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> you!"

"Be quiet, Jitendra! The same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> who fed us will show us Brindaban,
and return us to Agra."

A slight young <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> of pleasing countenance approached at rapid
pace. Halting under our tree, he bowed before me.

"Dear friend, you and your companion <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> be strangers here. Permit
me to be your host and guide."

It is scarcely possible for an Indian to pale, but Jitendra's face
was suddenly sickly. I politely declined the offer.

"You are surely not banishing me?" The stranger's alarm <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have
been comic in any other circumstances.

"Why not?"

"You are my guru." His eyes sought mine trustfully. "During my
midday devotions, the blessed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> Krishna appeared in a vision.
He showed me <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> forsaken figures under this very tree. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">One</span> face
was yours, my master! Often have I seen it in meditation! What joy
if you accept my humble services!"

"I too am glad you have <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> me. <span class="t4 t18 t22 hoverable">Neither</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> nor <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> has forsaken
us!" <span class="t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Though</span> I was motionless, smiling at the eager face before me,
an inward obeisance cast me at the <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Feet.

"Dear friends, will you not honor my home for a visit?"

"You are kind; but the plan is unfeasible. Already we are guests
of my brother in Agra."

"At least <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> me memories of touring Brindaban with you."

I gladly consented. The young man, who <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> was Pratap
Chatterji, hailed a horse carriage. We visited Madanamohana Temple
and other Krishna shrines. Night descended while we were at our
temple devotions.

"Excuse me while I get SANDESH." {FN11-6} Pratap entered a shop

near the railroad station. Jitendra and I sauntered along the
wide street, crowded now in the comparative coolness. Our friend
was absent for some time, but finally returned with gifts of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span>
sweetmeats.

"Please allow me to gain this religious merit." Pratap smiled
pleadingly as he held out a bundle of rupee notes and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> tickets,
just purchased, to Agra.

The reverence of my acceptance was for the Invisible Hand. Scoffed
at by Ananta, had Its bounty not <span class="t6 t9 t18 t26 hoverable">far</span> exceeded necessity?

We sought out a secluded spot near the station.

"Pratap, I will instruct you in the KRIYA of Lahiri Mahasaya, the
greatest yogi of modern times. His technique will be your guru."

The initiation was concluded in a half hour. "KRIYA is your CHINTAMANI,"
{FN11-7} I told the <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> student. "The technique, which as you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span>
is simple, embodies the art of quickening man's <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> evolution.
Hindu scriptures teach that the incarnating ego requires a million
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span> to obtain liberation from MAYA. This natural period is
greatly shortened through KRIYA YOGA. Just as Jagadis Chandra Bose
has demonstrated that plant growth can be accelerated <span class="t6 t9 t18 t26 hoverable">far</span> beyond
its normal rate, so man's psychological development can be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span>

speeded by an inner science. Be faithful in your practice; you will
approach the Guru of all gurus."

"I am transported to find this yogic key, <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> sought!" Pratap
spoke thoughtfully. "Its unshackling effect on my sensory bonds
will free me for higher spheres. The vision today of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> Krishna
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> only mean my <span class="t6 t9 t22 t29 hoverable">highest</span> good."

We sat awhile in silent understanding, then walked slowly to the
station. Joy was <span class="t5 t7 hoverable">within</span> me as I boarded the train, but this was
Jitendra's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> for tears. My affectionate farewell to Pratap had
been punctuated by stifled sobs from both my companions. The journey
once more <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> Jitendra in a welter of grief. Not for himself this
time, but against himself.

"How shallow my trust! My <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t16 t19 t22 t23 t25 t26 hoverable">heart</span> has been stone! <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">Never</span> in future
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> I doubt God's protection!"

Midnight was approaching. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> "Cinderellas," sent <span class="t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t9 t10 t11 t13 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">forth</span>
penniless, entered Ananta's bedroom. His face, as he had promised,
was a study in astonishment. Silently I showered the table with
rupees.

"Jitendra, the truth!" Ananta's tone was jocular. "Has not this
youngster been staging a holdup?"

But as the tale was unfolded, my brother turned sober, then solemn.

"The <span class="t0 t8 t12 t15 t19 t23 t25 hoverable">law</span> of demand and supply reaches into subtler realms than I
had supposed." Ananta spoke with a <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> enthusiasm <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> before
noticeable. "I understand for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> your indifference to
the vaults and vulgar accumulations of the world."

Late as it was, my brother insisted that he receive DIKSHA {FN11-8}
into KRIYA YOGA. The "guru" Mukunda had to shoulder the responsibility
of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> unsought disciples in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> day.

Breakfast the following morning was eaten in a harmony absent the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> before. I smiled at Jitendra.

"You <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> not be cheated of the Taj. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Let</span> us view it before starting
for Serampore."

Bidding farewell to Ananta, my friend and I were soon before the
glory of Agra, the Taj Mahal. White marble dazzling in the sun,
it stands a vision of pure symmetry. The perfect setting is dark
cypress, glossy lawn, and tranquil lagoon. The interior is exquisite
with lacelike carvings inlaid with semiprecious stones. Delicate
wreaths and scrolls emerge intricately from marbles, brown and
violet. Illumination from the dome falls on the cenotaphs of Emperor

Shah-Jahan and Mumtaz Mahall, queen of his realm and his heart.

Enough of sight-seeing! I was longing for my guru. Jitendra and I
were shortly traveling south by train toward Bengal.

"Mukunda, I have not seen my family in months. I have changed my
mind; perhaps later I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> visit your <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">master</span> in Serampore."

My friend, who <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> mildly be described as vacillating in temperament,
left me in Calcutta. By local train I soon reached Serampore, twelve
miles to the north.

A throb of wonderment stole over me as I realized that twenty-eight
<span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t11 t20 t26 t27 hoverable">days</span> had elapsed since the Benares meeting with my guru. "You will
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> to me in four weeks!" Here I was, <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t16 t19 t22 t23 t25 t26 hoverable">heart</span> pounding, standing
<span class="t5 t7 hoverable">within</span> his courtyard on quiet Rai Ghat Lane. I entered for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span>

CHAPTER: 12

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">YEARS</span> IN MY MASTER'S HERMITAGE

"You have come." Sri Yukteswar greeted me from a tiger skin on the
floor of a balconied sitting room. His voice was cold, his manner
unemotional.

"Yes, dear Master, I am here to follow you." Kneeling, I touched
his feet.

"How can that be? You ignore my wishes."

"No longer, Guruji! Your wish <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> be my law!"

"That is better! Now I can assume responsibility for your life."

"I willingly transfer the burden, Master."

"My <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> request, then, is that you return home to your family.
I want you to enter college in Calcutta. Your education should be
continued."

"Very well, sir." I hid my consternation. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Would</span> importunate books
pursue me down the years? <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">First</span> Father, now Sri Yukteswar!

"Someday you will go to the West. Its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> will lend ears more
receptive to India's ancient wisdom if the strange Hindu teacher
has a university degree."

"You <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">know</span> best, Guruji." My gloom departed. The reference to the
West I <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> puzzling, remote; but my opportunity to please <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span>

by obedience was vitally immediate.

"You will be near in Calcutta; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> here whenever you find time."

"Every <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> if possible, Master! Gratefully I accept your authority
in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> detail of my life-on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> condition."

"Yes?"

"That you promise to reveal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> to me!"

An hour-long verbal tussle ensued. A master's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">word</span> <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">cannot</span> be
falsified; it is not lightly given. The implications in the pledge
open out vast metaphysical vistas. A guru <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> be on intimate
terms indeed with the Creator before he can obligate Him to appear!
I sensed Sri Yukteswar's <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> unity, and was determined, as his
disciple, to press my advantage.

"You are of exacting disposition!" Then Master's consent rang out
with compassionate finality:

"Let your wish be my wish."

Lifelong shadow lifted from my heart; the vague search, hither and
yon, was over. I had <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> eternal shelter in a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> guru.

"Come; I will show you the hermitage." <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> rose from his tiger
mat. I glanced about me; my gaze fell with astonishment on a wall
picture, garlanded with a spray of jasmine.

"Lahiri Mahasaya!"

"Yes, my <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> guru." Sri Yukteswar's tone was reverently vibrant.
"Greater he was, as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> and yogi, than any other teacher <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whose</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span>
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> <span class="t5 t7 hoverable">within</span> the range of my investigations."

Silently I bowed before the familiar picture. Soul-homage sped to
the peerless <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">master</span> who, blessing my infancy, had guided my steps
to this hour.

Led by my guru, I strolled over the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> and its grounds.
Large, ancient and well-built, the hermitage was surrounded by a
massive-pillared courtyard. Outer walls were moss-covered; pigeons
fluttered over the flat gray roof, unceremoniously sharing the
ashram quarters. A rear garden was pleasant with jackfruit, mango,
and plantain trees. Balustraded balconies of upper rooms in the
two-storied building faced the courtyard from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> sides. A spacious
ground-floor hall, with high ceiling supported by colonnades, was
used, <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> said, chiefly during the annual festivities of DURGAPUJA.
{FN12-1} A narrow stairway led to Sri Yukteswar's sitting room,

whose small balcony overlooked the street. The ashram was plainly
furnished; everything was simple, clean, and utilitarian. Several
Western styled chairs, benches, and tables were in evidence.

<span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> invited me to stay overnight. A supper of vegetable curry was
served by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> young disciples who were receiving hermitage training.

"Guruji, please tell me something of your life." I was squatting
on a straw mat near his tiger skin. The friendly stars were very
close, it seemed, beyond the balcony.

"My family <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> was Priya Nath Karar. I was born {FN12-2} here
in Serampore, where <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t28 hoverable">Father</span> was a wealthy businessman. He left me
this ancestral mansion, now my hermitage. My formal schooling was
little; I <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> it slow and shallow. In early manhood, I undertook
the responsibilities of a householder, and have <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> daughter, now
married. My middle <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> was blessed with the guidance of Lahiri
Mahasaya. After my wife died, I joined the Swami <span class="t0 t6 t7 t8 t11 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">Order</span> and received
the <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> of Sri Yukteswar Giri. {FN12-3} Such are my simple
annals."

<span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> smiled at my eager face. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Like</span> all biographical sketches,
his <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">words</span> had <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> the outward facts <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> revealing the inner
man.

"Guruji, I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> to hear some stories of your childhood."

"I will tell you a few-each <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> with a moral!" Sri Yukteswar's
eyes twinkled with his warning. "My mother once tried to frighten
me with an appalling story of a ghost in a dark chamber. I <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span>
there immediately, and expressed my disappointment at having missed
the ghost. Mother <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> told me <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">another</span> horror-tale. Moral: Look
fear in the face and it will cease to trouble you.

"Another early memory is my wish for an ugly dog belonging to
a neighbor. I kept my household in turmoil for weeks to get that
dog. My ears were deaf to offers of pets with more prepossessing
appearance. Moral: Attachment is blinding; it lends an imaginary
halo of attractiveness to the object of desire.

"A third story concerns the plasticity of the youthful mind. I
heard my mother remark occasionally: 'A <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> who accepts a job under
anyone is a slave.' That impression became so indelibly fixed that
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> after my marriage I refused all positions. I met expenses by
investing my family endowment in land. Moral: <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Good</span> and positive
suggestions should instruct the sensitive ears of children. Their
early ideas <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> remain sharply etched."

<span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> fell into tranquil silence. Around midnight he led me to
a narrow cot. Sleep was sound and sweet the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> night under my

guru's roof.

Sri Yukteswar chose the following morning to grant me his KRIYA YOGA
initiation. The technique I had already received from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> disciples
of Lahiri Mahasaya-Father and my tutor, Swami Kebalananda-but in
Master's presence I felt transforming power. At his touch, a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> broke <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> my being, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> glory of countless suns blazing
together. A flood of ineffable bliss, overwhelming my <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t16 t19 t22 t23 t25 t26 hoverable">heart</span> to an
innermost core, continued during the following day. It was late
that afternoon before I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> <span class="t22 hoverable">bring</span> myself to leave the hermitage.

"You will return in thirty days." As I reached my Calcutta home,
the fulfillment of Master's prediction entered with me. None of my
relatives <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> the pointed remarks I had feared about the reappearance
of the "soaring bird."

I climbed to my little attic and bestowed affectionate glances,
as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> on a living presence. "You have witnessed my meditations,
and the tears and storms of my SADHANA. Now I have reached the
harbor of my <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> teacher."

"Son, I am happy for us both." <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t28 hoverable">Father</span> and I sat <span class="t16 t21 hoverable">together</span> in the
evening calm. "You have <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> your guru, as in miraculous fashion
I once <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> my own.

our lives. Your <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">master</span> has proved no inaccessible Himalayan saint,

surmise that I was little seen in the college classrooms. The
Serampore hermitage held a lure too irresistible. <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> accepted
my ubiquitous presence <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> comment. To my relief, he seldom

guru awoke before dawn. Lying down, or sometimes sitting on the bed,
he entered a state of SAMADHI. {FN12-4} It was simplicity itself
to discover when <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> had awakened: abrupt halt of stupendous
snores. {FN12-5} A sigh or two; perhaps a bodily movement. Then a
soundless state of breathlessness: he was in deep yogic joy.

Breakfast did not follow; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> a <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> walk by the Ganges.
Those morning strolls with my guru-how real and vivid still! In
the easy resurrection of memory, I often find myself by his side:

the early <span class="t0 t8 t11 t14 t23 t25 t28 hoverable">sun</span> is warming the river. His voice rings out, rich with
the authenticity of wisdom.

A bath; then the midday meal. Its preparation, <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">according</span> to Master's
daily directions, had been the careful task of young disciples. My
guru was a vegetarian. Before embracing monkhood, however, he had
eaten eggs and fish. His advice to students was to follow any simple
diet which proved suited to one's constitution.

<span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> ate little; often rice, colored with turmeric or juice of
beets or spinach and lightly sprinkled with buffalo GHEE or melted
butter. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Another</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> he <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t18 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">might</span> have lentil-DHAL or CHANNA {FN12-6}

an equal courtesy and kindness. To a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> who has realized himself

a striking similarity of aspect.

The impartiality of saints is rooted in wisdom. Masters have escaped
MAYA; its alternating faces of intellect and idiocy no longer cast
an influential glance. Sri Yukteswar showed no special consideration
to those who happened to be powerful or accomplished; <span class="t4 t18 t22 hoverable">neither</span> did

he slight <span class="t1 t7 t13 hoverable">others</span> for their poverty or illiteracy. He <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> listen

Eight o'clock was the supper hour, and sometimes <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> lingering
guests. My guru <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> not excuse himself to eat alone; none left his
ashram hungry or dissatisfied. Sri Yukteswar was <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> at a loss,
<span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> dismayed by unexpected visitors; scanty food <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> emerge
a banquet under his resourceful direction. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> he was economical;
his modest funds <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> far. "Be comfortable <span class="t5 t7 hoverable">within</span> your purse,"
he often said. "Extravagance will buy you discomfort." Whether in
the details of hermitage entertainment, or his building and repair
work, or other practical concerns, <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> manifested the originality
of a creative spirit.

Quiet evening hours often <span class="t2 t4 t5 t22 t23 hoverable">brought</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of my guru's discourses,
treasures against time. His <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> utterance was measured and chiseled
by wisdom. A sublime self-assurance marked his mode of expression:
it was unique. He spoke as none other in my experience <span class="t29 hoverable">ever</span> spoke.
His thoughts were weighed in a delicate balance of discrimination
before he permitted them an outward garb. The essence of truth,
all-pervasive with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> a physiological aspect, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> from him <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span>

a fragrant exudation of the soul. I was conscious always that I
was in the presence of a living manifestation of God. The weight
of his divinity automatically bowed my head before him.

If late guests detected that Sri Yukteswar was becoming engrossed
with the Infinite, he quickly engaged them in conversation. He was
incapable of striking a pose, or of flaunting his inner withdrawal.
Always <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> with the Lord, he needed no separate <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> for communion.
A self-realized <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">master</span> has already left behind the stepping stone
of meditation. "The flower falls when the fruit appears." But saints
often cling to <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> forms for the encouragement of disciples.

As midnight approached, my guru <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t18 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">might</span> fall into a doze with the
naturalness of a child. There was no fuss about bedding. He often
lay down, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> a pillow, on a narrow davenport which was
the background for his customary tiger-skin seat.

A night-long philosophical discussion was not rare; any disciple
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> summon it by intensity of interest. I felt no tiredness then,
no desire for sleep; Master's living <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">words</span> were sufficient. "Oh,
it is dawn! <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Let</span> us walk by the Ganges." So ended <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> of my periods
of nocturnal edification.

My early months with Sri Yukteswar culminated in a useful lesson-"How
to Outwit a Mosquito." At home my family always <span class="t27 hoverable">used</span> protective

curtains at night. I was dismayed to discover that in the Serampore
hermitage this prudent custom was honored in the breach. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> the
insects were in full residency; I was bitten from head to foot. My
guru <span class="t4 hoverable">took</span> pity on me.

"Buy yourself a curtain, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> for me." He laughed and added,
"If you buy only one, for yourself, all mosquitoes will concentrate
on me!"

I was more than thankful to comply. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Every</span> night that I spent in
Serampore, my guru <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> ask me to arrange the bedtime curtains.

The mosquitoes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> evening were especially virulent. But <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span>
failed to issue his usual instructions. I listened nervously to
the anticipatory hum of the insects. Getting into bed, I threw a
propitiatory prayer in their general direction. A half hour later,
I coughed pretentiously to attract my guru's attention. I <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span>
I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> go mad with the bites and especially the singing drone as
the mosquitoes celebrated bloodthirsty rites.

No responsive stir from Master; I approached him cautiously. He was
not breathing. This was my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> observation of him in the yogic
trance; it filled me with fright.

"His <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t16 t19 t22 t23 t25 t26 hoverable">heart</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> have failed!" I placed a mirror under his nose;

no breath-vapor appeared. To <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> doubly certain, for minutes I
closed his mouth and nostrils with my fingers. His <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> was cold
and motionless. In a daze, I turned toward the door to summon help.

"So! A budding experimentalist! My poor nose!" Master's voice was
shaky with laughter. "Why don't you go to bed? Is the <span class="t3 t5 t7 t9 t20 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span>
going to change for you? Change yourself: be rid of the mosquito
consciousness."

Meekly I returned to my bed. Not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> insect ventured near. I realized
that my guru had previously agreed to the curtains only to please
me; he had no fear of mosquitoes. His yogic <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> was such that
he either <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> will them not to bite, or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> escape to an inner
invulnerability.

"He was giving me a demonstration," I thought. "That is the yogic
state I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> strive to attain." A yogi <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> be able to <span class="t5 hoverable">pass</span> into,
and continue in, the superconsciousness, regardless of multitudinous
distractions <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> absent from this earth. Whether in the buzz of
insects or the pervasive glare of daylight, the testimony of the
senses <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> be barred.

worlds fairer than the banished Eden. {FN12-7}

The instructive mosquitoes served for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">another</span> early lesson at the
ashram. It was the gentle hour of dusk. My guru was matchlessly

interpreting the ancient texts. At his feet, I was in perfect peace.
A rude mosquito entered the idyl and competed for my attention. As
it dug a poisonous hypodermic needle into my thigh, I automatically
raised an avenging hand. Reprieve from impending execution! An
opportune memory <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> to me of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of Patanjali's yoga aphorisms-that

"I don't understand."

"Patanjali's <span class="t6 t13 t14 t25 t27 hoverable">meaning</span> was the removal of DESIRE to kill." Sri
Yukteswar had <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> my mental processes an open book. "This <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span>

similar compulsion to feel anger or animosity. All forms of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span>

secret of <span class="t14 hoverable">creation</span> will be in harmony with its countless bewildering
expressions. All <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> approach that understanding who curb the
inner passion for destruction."

"Guruji, should <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> offer himself a <span class="t27 hoverable">sacrifice</span> rather than kill a
wild beast?"

"No; man's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> is precious. It has the <span class="t6 t9 t22 t29 hoverable">highest</span> evolutionary
value because of unique brain and spinal centers. These enable the
advanced devotee to fully grasp and express the loftiest aspects
of divinity. No lower <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> is so equipped. It is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span>
incurs the debt of a minor <span class="t26 hoverable">sin</span> if he is forced to kill an animal or
any living thing. But the VEDAS teach that wanton loss of a <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span>
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> is a serious transgression against the karmic law."

I sighed in relief; scriptural reinforcement of one's natural
instincts is not always forthcoming.

It so happened that I <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> saw <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> at close quarters with a
leopard or a tiger. But a deadly cobra once confronted him, only
to be conquered by my guru's love. This variety of snake is <span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">much</span>
feared in India, where it causes more than five thousand deaths
annually. The dangerous encounter <span class="t4 hoverable">took</span> <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> at Puri, where Sri
Yukteswar had a <span class="t6 hoverable">second</span> hermitage, charmingly situated near the Bay
of Bengal. Prafulla, a young disciple of later years, was with
<span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> on this occasion.

"We were seated outdoors near the ashram," Prafulla told me. "A
cobra appeared near-by, a four-foot length of sheer terror. Its

hood was angrily expanded as it raced toward us. My guru gave a
welcoming chuckle, as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> to a child. I was beside myself with
consternation to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> engage in a rhythmical clapping of
hands. {FN12-8} He was entertaining the dread visitor! I remained
absolutely quiet, inwardly ejaculating what fervent prayers I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span>
muster. The serpent, very close to my guru, was now motionless,
seemingly magnetized by his caressing attitude. The frightful hood
gradually contracted; the snake slithered between Master's feet
and disappeared into the bushes.

"Why my guru <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> move his hands, and why the cobra <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> not
strike them, were inexplicable to me then," Prafulla concluded. "I
have since <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> to realize that my <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">master</span> is beyond fear of
hurt from any living creature."

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">One</span> afternoon during my early months at the ashram, <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> Sri
Yukteswar's eyes fixed on me piercingly.

"You are too thin, Mukunda."

His remark struck a sensitive point. That my sunken eyes and
emaciated appearance were <span class="t6 t9 t18 t26 hoverable">far</span> from my liking was testified to by
rows of tonics in my room at Calcutta. <span class="t15 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">Nothing</span> availed; chronic
dyspepsia had pursued me since childhood. My despair reached an
occasional zenith when I asked myself if it were worth-while to

carry on this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> with a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> so unsound.

"Medicines have limitations; the creative life-force has none.
Believe that: you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> be <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t8 t10 t12 t13 t14 t17 t19 t23 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> and strong."

Sri Yukteswar's <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">words</span> aroused a conviction of personally-applicable
<span class="t3 t7 t9 t10 t15 t19 t22 hoverable">truth</span> which no other healer-and I had tried many!-had been able to
summon <span class="t5 t7 hoverable">within</span> me.

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Day</span> by day, behold! I waxed. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Two</span> weeks after Master's hidden
blessing, I had accumulated the invigorating weight which eluded
me in the past. My persistent stomach ailments vanished with
a lifelong permanency. On later occasions I witnessed my guru's
instantaneous <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> healings of persons suffering from ominous
disease-tuberculosis, diabetes, epilepsy, or paralysis. Not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span>

freedom from my cadaverous aspect.

"Years ago, I too was anxious to <span class="t0 t2 t16 t18 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">put</span> on weight," Sri Yukteswar told
me. "During convalescence after a severe illness, I visited Lahiri
Mahasaya in Benares.

"'Sir, I have been very sick and lost <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> pounds.'

"'I see, Yukteswar, {FN12-9} you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> yourself unwell, and now you

think you are thin.'

"This reply was <span class="t6 t9 t18 t26 hoverable">far</span> from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> I had expected; my guru, however,
added encouragingly:

"'Let me see; I am sure you ought to feel better tomorrow.'

"Taking his <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">words</span> as a gesture of secret healing toward my receptive
mind, I was not surprised the next morning at a welcome accession
of strength. I sought out my <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">master</span> and exclaimed exultingly, 'Sir,
I feel <span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">much</span> better today.'

"'Indeed! Today you invigorate yourself.'

"'No, master!' I protested. 'It was you who helped me; this is the

"'O yes! Your malady has been quite serious. Your <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> is frail

"The <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> of possible return of my weakness <span class="t2 t4 t5 t22 t23 hoverable">brought</span> me a shudder
of cold fear. The following morning I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> hardly drag myself to
Lahiri Mahasaya's home.

"'Sir, I am ailing again.'

"My guru's glance was quizzical. 'So! Once more you indispose
yourself.'

"'Gurudeva, I realize now that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> you have been ridiculing

"'Really, it has been your thoughts that have <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> you feel

"Knowing that Lahiri Mahasaya <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> spoke idly, I addressed him
with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> awe and gratitude: 'Master, if I think I am <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t8 t10 t12 t13 t14 t17 t19 t23 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> and

concentrated on my eyes.

"Lo! I felt an increase not alone of strength but of weight. Lahiri
Mahasaya retreated into silence. After a few hours at his feet, I

returned to my mother's home, where I stayed during my visits to
Benares.

"'My son! What is the matter? Are you swelling with dropsy?' Mother

dimensions it had possessed before my illness.

"I weighed myself and <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> that in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> I had gained fifty

Mahasaya as a result of this miracle.

"My guru, awake in God, knew this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> to be <span class="t15 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">nothing</span> but an objectivized

"All <span class="t14 hoverable">creation</span> is governed by law," Sri Yukteswar concluded. "The ones
which manifest in the outer universe, discoverable by scientists,
are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> natural laws. But there are subtler laws ruling the

Sri Yukteswar was a peerless interpreter of the scriptures. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Many</span> of
my happiest memories are centered in his discourses. But his jeweled

restless movement of my body, or my slight lapse into absent-mindedness,
sufficed to <span class="t0 t2 t16 t18 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">put</span> an abrupt period to Master's exposition.

"You are not here." <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> interrupted himself <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> afternoon with
this disclosure. As usual, he was keeping track of my attention
with a devastating immediacy.

"Guruji!" My tone was a protest. "I have not stirred; my eyelids
have not moved; I can repeat each <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">word</span> you have uttered!"

"Nevertheless you were not fully with me. Your objection forces me
to remark that in your mental background you were creating <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span>

hilltop, a third by the ocean."

Those vaguely formulated thoughts had indeed been present almost
subconsciously. I glanced at him apologetically.

"What can I do with such a master, who penetrates my random musings?"

glimpses of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> buildings, each in a <span class="t1 t2 t18 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">different</span> setting. In the
exact sequence Sri Yukteswar had indicated, these visions <span class="t4 hoverable">took</span>
ultimate form. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">First</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> my founding of a boys' yoga school on a

Ranchi plain, then my American headquarters on a Los Angeles hilltop,
finally a hermitage in southern California by the vast Pacific.

<span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> arrogantly asserted: "I prophesy that such and such
an event <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> occur!" He <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> rather hint: "Don't you think it

recanting; <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> did his slightly veiled <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">words</span> prove false.

Sri Yukteswar was reserved and matter-of-fact in demeanor. There
was naught of the vague or daft visionary about him. His feet
were firm on the earth, his head in the haven of heaven. Practical
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> aroused his admiration. "Saintliness is not dumbness! <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span>
perceptions are not incapacitating!" he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> say. "The active
expression of virtue gives rise to the keenest intelligence."

In Master's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> I fully discovered the cleavage between <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span>
realism and the obscure mysticism that spuriously passes as
a counterpart. My guru was reluctant to discuss the superphysical
realms. His only "marvelous" aura was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of perfect simplicity.
In conversation he avoided startling references; in action he was
freely expressive. <span class="t1 t7 t13 hoverable">Others</span> talked of miracles but <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> manifest
nothing; Sri Yukteswar seldom mentioned the subtle laws but secretly
operated them at will.

"A <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> of realization does not perform any miracle until he

receives an inward sanction," <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> explained. "God does not wish
the secrets of His <span class="t14 hoverable">creation</span> revealed promiscuously. {FN12-12} Also,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> individual in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> has inalienable <span class="t27 hoverable">right</span> to his free

The silence habitual to Sri Yukteswar was caused by his deep
perceptions of the Infinite. No <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> remained for the interminable
"revelations" that occupy the <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t11 t20 t26 t27 hoverable">days</span> of teachers <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> self-realization.
"In shallow <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> the fish of little thoughts <span class="t1 t3 t9 t15 t20 t21 t26 t29 hoverable">cause</span> <span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">much</span> commotion.
In oceanic minds the whales of inspiration <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> hardly a ruffle."
This observation from the Hindu scriptures is not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> discerning
humor.

Because of my guru's unspectacular guise, only a few of his
contemporaries recognized him as a superman. The popular adage: "He
is a fool that <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">cannot</span> conceal his wisdom," <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> be applied
to Sri Yukteswar. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Though</span> born a mortal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> all others, <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> had
achieved identity with the Ruler of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> and space.

perceived a godlike unity. He had not <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> any insuperable obstacle
to mergence of <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> with Divine. No such barrier exists, I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span>
to understand, save in man's <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> unadventurousness.

I always thrilled at the touch of Sri Yukteswar's <span class="t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t12 t15 t19 t20 t23 t25 hoverable">holy</span> feet.
Yogis teach that a disciple is spiritually magnetized by reverent
contact with a master; a subtle current is generated. The devotee's

undesirable habit-mechanisms in the brain are often cauterized; the
groove of his worldly tendencies beneficially disturbed. Momentarily
at least he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> find the secret veils of MAYA lifting, and glimpse
the reality of bliss. My <span class="t3 t5 t7 t9 t20 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> responded with a liberating
glow whenever I knelt in the Indian fashion before my guru.

"Even when Lahiri Mahasaya was silent," <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> told me, "or when
he conversed on other than strictly religious topics, I discovered
that nonetheless he had transmitted to me ineffable knowledge."

Sri Yukteswar affected me similarly. If I entered the hermitage in
a worried or indifferent frame of mind, my attitude imperceptibly
changed. A healing calm descended at mere sight of my guru. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Every</span>

did I find him deluded or intoxicated with greed or emotion or
anger or any <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> attachment.

"The darkness of MAYA is silently approaching. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Let</span> us hie homeward

disciples of their need for KRIYA YOGA. A <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> student occasionally
expressed doubts regarding his own worthiness to engage in yoga
practice.

"Forget the past," Sri Yukteswar <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> console him. "The vanished

improve if you are making a <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> effort now."

<span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> always had young CHELAS {FN12-13} in his hermitage. Their
<span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> and intellectual education was his lifelong interest:
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> shortly before he passed on, he accepted for training <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span>
six-year-old boys and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> youth of sixteen. He directed their minds
and lives with that careful discipline in which the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">word</span> "disciple"
is etymologically rooted. The ashram residents loved and revered
their guru; a slight clap of his hands sufficed to <span class="t22 hoverable">bring</span> them
eagerly to his side. When his mood was silent and withdrawn, no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span>
ventured to speak; when his laugh rang jovially, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">children</span> looked
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> him as their own.

<span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> seldom asked <span class="t1 t7 t13 hoverable">others</span> to render him a personal service, nor <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span>
he accept help from a student unless the willingness were sincere.
My guru quietly washed his clothes if the disciples overlooked that
privileged task. Sri Yukteswar wore the traditional ocher-colored
swami robe; his laceless shoes, in accordance with yogi custom,
were of tiger or deer skin.

<span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> spoke fluent English, French, Hindi, and Bengali; his
Sanskrit was fair. He patiently instructed his young disciples by
<span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> short cuts which he had ingeniously devised for the study
of English and Sanskrit.

Master was cautious of his body, while withholding solicitous
attachment. The Infinite, he pointed out, properly manifests through
physical and mental soundness. He discountenanced any extremes. A
disciple once started a <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> fast. My guru only laughed: "Why not
throw the dog a bone?"

Sri Yukteswar's health was excellent; I <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> saw him unwell.
{FN12-14} He permitted students to consult doctors if it seemed
advisable. His purpose was to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> respect to the worldly custom:
"Physicians <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> carry on their <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t7 t10 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> of healing through God's laws
as applied to matter." But he extolled the superiority of mental
therapy, and often repeated: "Wisdom is the greatest cleanser."

"The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> is a treacherous friend. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Give</span> it its due; no more,"
he said. "Pain and pleasure are transitory; endure all dualities
with calmness, while trying at the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> to remove their hold.
Imagination is the door through which disease as <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t8 t10 t12 t13 t14 t17 t19 t23 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> as healing
enters. Disbelieve in the reality of sickness <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> when you are
ill; an unrecognized visitor will flee!"

<span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> numbered <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> doctors <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span> his disciples. "Those who have
ferreted out the physical laws can easily investigate the science
of the soul," he told them. "A subtle <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> mechanism is hidden
just behind the bodily structure." {FN12-15}

Sri Yukteswar counseled his students to be living liaisons of
Western and Eastern virtues. Himself an executive Occidental in
outer habits, inwardly he was the <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> Oriental. He praised
the progressive, resourceful and hygienic habits of the West, and
the religious ideals which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> a centuried halo to the East.

Discipline had not been unknown to me: at home <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t28 hoverable">Father</span> was strict,
Ananta often severe. But Sri Yukteswar's training <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">cannot</span> be described
as other than drastic. A perfectionist, my guru was hypercritical
of his disciples, whether in matters of moment or in the subtle
nuances of behavior.

"Good manners <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> sincerity are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> a beautiful dead lady,"
he remarked on suitable occasion. "Straightforwardness <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span>
civility is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> a surgeon's knife, effective but unpleasant. Candor
with courtesy is helpful and admirable."

<span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> was apparently satisfied with my <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> progress, for he
seldom referred to it; in other matters my ears were no strangers
to reproof. My chief offenses were absentmindedness, intermittent
indulgence in sad moods, non-observance of <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> rules of etiquette,
and occasional unmethodical ways.

"Observe how the activities of your <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t28 hoverable">father</span> Bhagabati are well-organized

and balanced in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> way," my guru pointed out. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> disciples
of Lahiri Mahasaya had met, soon after I began my pilgrimages
to Serampore. <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t28 hoverable">Father</span> and Sri Yukteswar admiringly evaluated the
other's worth. Both had built an inner <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> granite,
insoluble against the ages.

From transient teachers of my earlier <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> I had imbibed a few
erroneous lessons. A CHELA, I was told, need not concern himself
strenuously over worldly duties; when I had neglected or carelessly
performed my tasks, I was not chastised. <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Human</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> finds such
instruction very easy of assimilation. Under Master's unsparing
rod, however, I soon recovered from the agreeable delusions of
irresponsibility.

"Those who are too <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> for this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> are adorning some other,"
Sri Yukteswar remarked. "So <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> as you breathe the free air of
earth, you are under obligation to render grateful service. He alone
who has fully mastered the breathless state {FN12-16} is freed from
cosmic imperatives. I will not fail to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">let</span> you <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">know</span> when you have
attained the final perfection."

My guru <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> be bribed, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> by love. He showed no leniency
to anyone who, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> myself, willingly offered to be his disciple.
Whether <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> and I were surrounded by his students or by strangers,
or were alone together, he always spoke plainly and upbraided

sharply. No trifling lapse into shallowness or inconsistency escaped
his rebuke. This flattening treatment was hard to endure, but my
resolve was to allow Sri Yukteswar to iron out each of my psychological
kinks. As he labored at this titanic transformation, I shook <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span>
times under the weight of his disciplinary hammer.

"If you don't <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> my words, you are at liberty to leave at any
time," <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> assured me. "I want <span class="t15 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">nothing</span> from you but your own
improvement. Stay only if you feel benefited."

For <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> humbling blow he dealt my vanity, for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> tooth in my
metaphorical jaw he knocked loose with stunning aim, I am grateful
beyond any facility of expression. The hard core of <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> egotism
is hardly to be dislodged except rudely. With its departure, the
<span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> finds at last an unobstructed channel. In vain It seeks to
percolate through flinty hearts of selfishness.

Sri Yukteswar's wisdom was so penetrating that, heedless of remarks,
he often replied to one's unspoken observation. "What a <span class="t9 hoverable">person</span>
imagines he hears, and what the speaker has really implied, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span>
be poles apart," he said. "Try to feel the thoughts behind the
confusion of men's verbiage."

But <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> insight is painful to worldly ears; <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> was not popular
with superficial students. The wise, always few in number, deeply

revered him. I daresay Sri Yukteswar <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have been the most
soughtafter guru in India had his <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">words</span> not been so candid and so
censorious.

"I am hard on those who <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> for my training," he admitted to me.
"That is my way; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">take</span> it or leave it. I will <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> compromise. But
you will be <span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">much</span> kinder to your disciples; that is your way. I try
to purify only in the fires of severity, searing beyond the average
toleration. The gentle approach of <span class="t7 hoverable">love</span> is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> transfiguring. The
inflexible and the yielding methods are equally effective if applied
with wisdom. You will go to foreign lands, where blunt assaults
on the ego are not appreciated. A teacher <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> not spread India's

and forbearance." I refuse to state the amount of <span class="t3 t7 t9 t10 t15 t19 t22 hoverable">truth</span> I later
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> to find in Master's words!

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Though</span> Sri Yukteswar's undissembling speech prevented a large
following during his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span> on earth, nevertheless his living <span class="t0 t1 t3 t5 t7 t8 t13 t16 t18 t20 t21 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">spirit</span>
manifests today over the world, through sincere students of his
KRIYA YOGA and other teachings. He has further dominion in men's
souls than <span class="t29 hoverable">ever</span> Alexander dreamed of in the soil.

<span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t28 hoverable">Father</span> arrived <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> to pay his respects to Sri Yukteswar. My
parent expected, very likely, to hear some <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">words</span> in my praise. He
was shocked to be <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> a <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> account of my imperfections. It was

Master's practice to recount simple, negligible shortcomings with
an air of portentous gravity. <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t28 hoverable">Father</span> rushed to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> me. "From your
guru's remarks I <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> to find you a complete wreck!" My parent
was between tears and laughter.

The only <span class="t1 t3 t9 t15 t20 t21 t26 t29 hoverable">cause</span> of Sri Yukteswar's displeasure at the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> was that
I had been trying, against his gentle hint, to convert a <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span>

With indignant speed I sought out my guru. He received me with
downcast eyes, as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> conscious of guilt.

I <span class="t29 hoverable">ever</span> saw the <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> lion meek before me. The unique moment was
savored to the full.

"Sir, why did you judge me so mercilessly before my astounded
father? Was that just?"

"I will not do it again." Master's tone was apologetic.

Instantly I was disarmed. How readily the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> admitted his
fault! <span class="t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Though</span> he <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> again upset Father's peace of mind, <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span>
relentlessly continued to dissect me whenever and wherever he chose.

<span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">New</span> disciples often joined Sri Yukteswar in exhaustive criticism
of others. Wise <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> the guru! Models of flawless discrimination!

But he who takes the offensive <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> not be defenseless. The same
carping students fled precipitantly as soon as <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> publicly
unloosed in their direction a few shafts from his analytical quiver.

"Tender inner weaknesses, revolting at mild touches of censure,
are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> diseased parts of the body, recoiling before <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> delicate
handling." This was Sri Yukteswar's amused comment on the flighty
ones.

There are disciples who seek a guru <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> in their own image. Such
students often complained that they did not understand Sri Yukteswar.

"Neither do you comprehend God!" I retorted on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> occasion. "When
a saint is clear to you, you will be one." <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Among</span> the trillion
mysteries, breathing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> <span class="t6 hoverable">second</span> the inexplicable air, who <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span>
venture to ask that the fathomless <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of a <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">master</span> be instantly
grasped?

Students came, and generally went. Those who craved a path of
oily sympathy and comfortable recognitions did not find it at the
hermitage. <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> offered shelter and shepherding for the aeons,
but <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> disciples miserly demanded ego-balm as well. They departed,
preferring life's countless humiliations before any humility.
Master's blazing rays, the open penetrating sunshine of his wisdom,
were too powerful for their <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> sickness. They sought some

lesser teacher who, shading them with flattery, permitted the fitful
sleep of ignorance.

During my early months with Master, I had experienced a sensitive
fear of his reprimands. These were reserved, I soon saw, for disciples
who had asked for his verbal vivisection. If any writhing student
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> a protest, Sri Yukteswar <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> <span class="t8 t13 hoverable">become</span> unoffendedly silent.
His <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">words</span> were <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> wrathful, but impersonal with wisdom.

Master's insight was not for the unprepared ears of casual visitors; he
seldom remarked on their defects, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> if conspicuous. But toward
students who sought his counsel, Sri Yukteswar felt a serious
responsibility. Brave indeed is the guru who undertakes to transform
the crude ore of ego-permeated humanity! A saint's courage roots
in his compassion for the stumbling eyeless of this world.

When I had abandoned underlying resentment, I <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> a marked decrease
in my chastisement. In a very subtle way, <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> melted into
comparative clemency. In <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> I demolished <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> wall of rationalization
and subconscious reservation behind which the <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> personality
generally shields itself. {FN12-17} The reward was an effortless
harmony with my guru. I discovered him then to be trusting, considerate,
and silently loving. Undemonstrative, however, he bestowed no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">word</span>
of affection.

My own temperament is principally devotional. It was disconcerting
at <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> to find that my guru, saturated with JNANA but seemingly
dry of BHAKTI, {FN12-18} expressed himself only in terms of
cold <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> mathematics. But as I tuned myself to his nature,
I discovered no diminution but rather increase in my devotional
approach to God. A self-realized <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">master</span> is fully able to guide his
various disciples along natural lines of their essential bias.

My relationship with Sri Yukteswar, somewhat inarticulate, nonetheless
possessed all eloquence. Often I <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> his silent signature on my
thoughts, rendering speech inutile. Quietly sitting beside him, I
felt his bounty pouring peacefully over my being.

Sri Yukteswar's impartial justice was notably demonstrated during
the summer vacation of my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> college year. I welcomed the opportunity
to spend uninterrupted months at Serampore with my guru.

"You <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be in charge of the hermitage." <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> was pleased over
my enthusiastic arrival. "Your duties will be the reception of
guests, and supervision of the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t7 t10 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> of the other disciples."

Kumar, a young villager from east Bengal, was accepted a fortnight
later for hermitage training. Remarkably intelligent, he quickly
won Sri Yukteswar's affection. For some unfathomable reason, <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span>
was very lenient to the <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> resident.

"Mukunda, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">let</span> Kumar assume your duties. Employ your own <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> in
sweeping and cooking." <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> issued these instructions after the
<span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> boy had been with us for a month.

Exalted to leadership, Kumar exercised a petty household tyranny.
In silent mutiny, the other disciples continued to seek me out for
daily counsel.

"Mukunda is impossible! You <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> me supervisor, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> the <span class="t1 t7 t13 hoverable">others</span> go
to him and obey him." <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Three</span> weeks later Kumar was complaining to
our guru. I overheard him from an adjoining room.

"That's why I assigned him to the kitchen and you to the parlor."
Sri Yukteswar's withering tones were <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> to Kumar. "In this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> you

and not to dominate. You wanted Mukunda's position, but <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> not
maintain it by merit. Return now to your earlier <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t7 t10 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> as cook's
assistant."

After this humbling incident, <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> resumed toward Kumar a former
attitude of unwonted indulgence. Who can solve the mystery of
attraction? In Kumar our guru discovered a charming fount which
did not spurt for the fellow disciples. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Though</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> boy was
obviously Sri Yukteswar's favorite, I felt no dismay. Personal

idiosyncrasies, possessed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> by masters, lend a rich complexity
to the pattern of life. My <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> is seldom commandeered by a detail;
I was seeking from Sri Yukteswar a more inaccessible benefit than
an outward praise.

Kumar spoke venomously to me <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> reason; I was deeply
hurt.

"Your head is swelling to the bursting point!" I added a warning
<span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whose</span> <span class="t3 t7 t9 t10 t15 t19 t22 hoverable">truth</span> I felt intuitively: "Unless you mend your ways, someday
you will be asked to leave this ashram."

Laughing sarcastically, Kumar repeated my remark to our guru, who
had just entered the room. Fully expecting to be scolded, I retired
meekly to a corner.

"Maybe Mukunda is right." Master's reply to the boy <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> with
unusual coldness. I escaped <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> castigation.

A year later, Kumar <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t15 t17 t18 t19 hoverable">set</span> out for a visit to his childhood home.
He ignored the quiet disapproval of Sri Yukteswar, who <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span>
authoritatively controlled his disciples' movements. On the boy's
return to Serampore in a few months, a change was unpleasantly
apparent. Gone was the stately Kumar with serenely glowing face.
Only an undistinguished peasant stood before us, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> who had lately

acquired a number of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> habits.

<span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> summoned me and brokenheartedly discussed the fact that the
boy was now unsuited to the monastic hermitage life.

"Mukunda, I will leave it to you to instruct Kumar to leave the
ashram tomorrow; I can't do it!" Tears stood in Sri Yukteswar's
eyes, but he controlled himself quickly. "The boy <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> have
fallen to these depths had he listened to me and not gone <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">away</span> to
mix with undesirable companions. He has rejected my protection;
the callous <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> be his guru still."

Kumar's departure <span class="t2 t4 t5 t22 t23 hoverable">brought</span> me no elation; sadly I wondered how <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span>

allures. Enjoyment of wine and sex are rooted in the natural man,
and require no delicacies of perception for their appreciation.
Sense wiles are comparable to the evergreen oleander, fragrant with
its multicolored flowers: <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of the plant is poisonous.

sought in a thousand misdirections. {FN12-19}

"Keen <span class="t20 hoverable">intelligence</span> is two-edged," <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> once remarked in reference
to Kumar's brilliant mind. "It <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be <span class="t27 hoverable">used</span> constructively or

law."

My guru mixed freely with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> and women disciples, treating

distinction or partiality.

"In sleep, you do not <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">know</span> whether you are a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> or a woman," he
said. "Just as a man, impersonating a woman, does not <span class="t8 t13 hoverable">become</span> one,
so the soul, impersonating both <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> and woman, has no sex. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span>
is the pure, changeless image of God."

Sri Yukteswar <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> avoided or blamed women as objects of seduction.
Men, he said, were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> a temptation to women. I once inquired of
my guru why a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> ancient saint had <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> women "the door to
hell."

"A girl <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> have proved very troublesome to his peace of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> in
his early life," my guru answered causticly. "Otherwise he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have
denounced, not woman, but some imperfection in his own self-control."

If a visitor dared to relate a suggestive story in the hermitage,
<span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> maintain an unresponsive silence. "Do not allow yourself
to be thrashed by the provoking whip of a beautiful face," he told
the disciples. "How can sense slaves enjoy the world? Its subtle

flavors escape them while they grovel in primal mud. All nice
discriminations are lost to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> of elemental lusts."

Students seeking to escape from the dualistic MAYA delusion received
from Sri Yukteswar patient and understanding counsel.

"Just as the purpose of eating is to satisfy hunger, not greed,
so the sex instinct is designed for the propagation of the species
<span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">according</span> to natural law, <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> for the kindling of insatiable
longings," he said. "Destroy wrong desires now; otherwise they
will follow you after the astral <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> is torn from its physical

resistant. If temptation assails you with cruel force, overcome it
by impersonal analysis and indomitable will. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Every</span> natural passion

openings in the reservoir of your inner peace, permitting healing
waters to be wasted in the desert soil of materialism. The forceful
activating impulse of wrong desire is the greatest enemy to the
happiness of man. Roam in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> as a lion of self-control;

The devotee is finally freed from all instinctive compulsions. He

transforms his need for <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> affection into aspiration for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span>
alone, a <span class="t7 hoverable">love</span> solitary because omnipresent.

Sri Yukteswar's mother lived in the Rana Mahal district of Benares
where I had <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> visited my guru. Gracious and kindly, she was

I stood on her balcony <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span>

In his quiet,
sensible way, <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> was trying to convince her about something.
He was apparently unsuccessful, for she shook her head with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>
vigor.

"Nay, nay, my son, go <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">away</span> now!

am not your disciple!"

Sri Yukteswar backed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">away</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> further argument, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> a scolded

I was touched at his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> respect for his mother <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> in
her unreasonable moods. She saw him only as her little boy, not as a
sage. There was a charm about the trifling incident; it supplied
a sidelight on my guru's unusual nature, inwardly humble and
outwardly unbendable.

The monastic regulations do not allow a swami to retain connection
with worldly ties after their formal severance. He <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">cannot</span> perform
the ceremonial family rites which are obligatory on the householder.

the injunctions. At the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> of his beloved mother, he cremated her
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> with heavenly <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> which he caused to spurt from his upraised
hand.

Sri Yukteswar <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> ignored the restrictions, in a fashion less
spectacular. When his mother passed on, he arranged the crematory
services by the <span class="t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t12 t15 t19 t20 t23 t25 hoverable">holy</span> Ganges in Benares, and fed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> Brahmins in
conformance with age-old custom.

The SHASTRIC prohibitions were intended to help swamis overcome
narrow identifications. Shankara and Sri Yukteswar had wholly merged
their beings in the Impersonal Spirit; they needed no rescue by
rule. Sometimes, too, a <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">master</span> purposely ignores a canon in <span class="t0 t6 t7 t8 t11 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">order</span>
to uphold its principle as superior to and independent of form. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span>
<span class="t4 t17 t22 hoverable">Jesus</span> plucked ears of corn on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> of rest. To the inevitable
critics he said: "The sabbath was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> for man, and not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> for
the sabbath." {FN12-20}

Outside of the scriptures, seldom was a <span class="t25 hoverable">book</span> honored by Sri
Yukteswar's perusal. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> he was invariably acquainted with the
latest scientific discoveries and other advancements of knowledge.
A brilliant conversationalist, he enjoyed an exchange of views on
countless topics with his guests. My guru's ready wit and rollicking
laugh enlivened <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> discussion. Often grave, <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> was <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span>
gloomy. "To seek the Lord, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> need not disfigure his face," he

would remark. "Remember that finding <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> will mean the funeral of

to the hermitage, a number arrived for their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> visit with the
expectation of meeting an orthodox religionist. A supercilious
smile or a glance of amused tolerance occasionally betrayed that
the newcomers anticipated <span class="t15 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">nothing</span> more than a few pious platitudes.
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> their reluctant departure <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> <span class="t22 hoverable">bring</span> an expressed conviction
that Sri Yukteswar had shown precise insight into their specialized
fields.

My guru ordinarily was gentle and affable to guests; his welcome was
<span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> with charming cordiality. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> inveterate egotists sometimes
suffered an invigorating shock. They confronted in <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> either
a frigid indifference or a formidable opposition: ice or iron!

A noted chemist once crossed swords with Sri Yukteswar. The
visitor <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> not admit the existence of God, inasmuch as science
has devised no <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t14 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">means</span> of detecting Him.

"So you have inexplicably failed to isolate the Supreme <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Power</span> in
your test tubes!" Master's gaze was stern. "I recommend an unheard-of
experiment. Examine your thoughts unremittingly for twenty-four
hours. Then wonder no longer at God's absence."

A celebrated pundit received a similar jolt. With ostentatious
zeal, the scholar shook the ashram rafters with scriptural lore.
Resounding passages poured from the MAHABHARATA, the UPANISHADS,
{FN12-21} the BHASYAS {FN12-22} of Shankara.

"I am waiting to hear you." Sri Yukteswar's tone was inquiring, as
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> utter silence had reigned. The pundit was puzzled.

"Quotations there have been, in superabundance." Master's <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">words</span>
convulsed me with mirth, as I squatted in my corner, at a respectful
distance from the visitor. "But what original commentary can you
supply, from the uniqueness of your particular life? What <span class="t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t12 t15 t19 t20 t23 t25 hoverable">holy</span>
<span class="t2 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t20 t24 t29 hoverable">text</span> have you absorbed and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> your own? In what ways have these
timeless truths renovated your nature? Are you content to be a
hollow victrola, mechanically repeating the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">words</span> of other men?"

"I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> up!" The scholar's chagrin was comical. "I have no inner
realization."

For the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> time, perhaps, he understood that discerning placement
of the comma does not atone for a <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> coma.

"These bloodless pedants smell unduly of the lamp," my guru remarked
after the departure of the chastened one. "They prefer philosophy

to be a gentle intellectual setting-up exercise. Their elevated
thoughts are carefully unrelated either to the crudity of outward
action or to any scourging inner discipline!"

<span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> stressed on other occasions the futility of mere <span class="t25 hoverable">book</span>
learning.

"Do not confuse understanding with a larger vocabulary," he remarked.
"Sacred writings are beneficial in stimulating desire for inward
realization, if <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> stanza at a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> is slowly assimilated. Continual
intellectual study results in vanity and the false satisfaction of
an undigested knowledge."

Sri Yukteswar related <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of his own experiences in scriptural
edification. The scene was a forest hermitage in eastern Bengal,
where he observed the procedure of a renowned teacher, Dabru Ballav.
His method, at once simple and difficult, was common in ancient
India.

Dabru Ballav had gathered his disciples around him in the sylvan
solitudes. The <span class="t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t12 t15 t19 t20 t23 t25 hoverable">holy</span> BHAGAVAD GITA was open before them. Steadfastly
they looked at <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> passage for half an hour, then closed their eyes.
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Another</span> half hour slipped away. The <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">master</span> gave a brief comment.
Motionless, they meditated again for an hour. Finally the guru
spoke.

"Have you understood?"

"Yes, sir." <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">One</span> in the group ventured this assertion.

"No; not fully. Seek the <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> vitality that has <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> these

hour disappeared in silence. The <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">master</span> dismissed the students,
and turned to Sri Yukteswar.

"Do you <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">know</span> the BHAGAVAD GITA?"

"No, sir, not really; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> my eyes and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> have run through its

"Thousands have replied to me differently!" The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> sage smiled
at <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> in blessing. "If <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> busies himself with an outer display

after the priceless pearls?"

Sri Yukteswar directed the study of his own disciples by the same
intensive method of one-pointedness. "Wisdom is not assimilated
with the eyes, but with the atoms," he said. "When your conviction
of a <span class="t3 t7 t9 t10 t15 t19 t22 hoverable">truth</span> is not merely in your brain but in your being, you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span>
diffidently vouch for its meaning." He discouraged any tendency a

student <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t18 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">might</span> have to construe book-knowledge as a necessary step
to <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> realization.

"The RISHIS wrote in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> sentence profundities that commentating
scholars busy themselves over for generations," he remarked. "Endless
literary controversy is for sluggard minds. What more liberating
<span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> than 'God is'-nay, 'God'?"

But <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> does not easily return to simplicity. It is seldom "God"
for him, but rather learned pomposities. His ego is pleased, that
he can grasp such erudition.

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Men</span> who were pridefully conscious of high worldly position were likely,
in Master's presence, to add humility to their other possessions.
A local magistrate once arrived for an interview at the seaside
hermitage in Puri. The man, who held a reputation for ruthlessness, had
it <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t8 t10 t12 t13 t14 t17 t19 t23 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> <span class="t5 t7 hoverable">within</span> his <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> to oust us from the ashram. I cautioned
my guru about the despotic possibilities. But he seated himself
with an uncompromising air, and did not rise to greet the visitor.
Slightly nervous, I squatted near the door. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> had to content
himself with a wooden box; my guru did not request me to fetch
a chair. There was no fulfillment of the magistrate's obvious
expectation that his importance <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be ceremoniously acknowledged.

A metaphysical discussion ensued. The guest blundered through

misinterpretations of the scriptures. As his accuracy sank, his
ire rose.

"Do you <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">know</span> that I stood <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> in the M. A. examination?" Reason
had forsaken him, but he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> still shout.

"Mr. Magistrate, you forget that this is not your courtroom," <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span>
replied evenly. "From your childish remarks I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have surmised
that your college career was unremarkable. A university degree,
in any case, is not remotely related to Vedic realization. Saints
are not produced in batches <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> semester <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> accountants."

After a stunned silence, the visitor laughed heartily.

"This is my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> encounter with a heavenly magistrate," he said.
Later he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> a formal request, couched in the legal terms which

"probationary" disciple.

My guru personally attended to the details connected with the
management of his property. Unscrupulous persons on various occasions
attempted to secure possession of Master's ancestral land. With
determination and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> by instigating lawsuits, Sri Yukteswar
outwitted <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> opponent. He underwent these painful experiences from
a desire <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> to be a begging guru, or a burden on his disciples.

His financial independence was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> reason why my alarmingly
outspoken <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> was innocent of the cunnings of diplomacy. Unlike
those teachers who have to flatter their supporters, my guru was
impervious to the influences, open or subtle, of others' wealth.
<span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">Never</span> did I hear him ask or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> hint for money for any purpose.
His hermitage training was <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> free and freely to all disciples.

An insolent court deputy arrived <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> at the Serampore ashram
to serve Sri Yukteswar with a legal summons. A disciple named Kanai
and myself were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> present. The officer's attitude toward <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span>
was offensive.

"It will do you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> to leave the shadows of your hermitage and breathe
the honest air of a courtroom." The deputy grinned contemptuously.
I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> not contain myself.

"Another <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">word</span> of your impudence and you will be on the floor!" I
advanced threateningly.

"You wretch!" Kanai's shout was simultaneous with my own. "Dare
you <span class="t22 hoverable">bring</span> your blasphemies into this sacred ashram?"

But <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> stood protectingly in front of his abuser. "Don't get
excited over nothing. This <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> is only doing his rightful duty."

The officer, dazed at his varying reception, respectfully offered
a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">word</span> of apology and sped away.

Amazing it was to find that a <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">master</span> with such a fiery will <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span>
be so calm within. He fitted the Vedic definition of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> of God:
"Softer than the flower, where kindness is concerned; stronger than
the thunder, where principles are at stake."

There are always those in this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> who, in Browning's words,
"endure no light, being themselves obscure." An outsider occasionally
berated Sri Yukteswar for an imaginary grievance. My imperturbable
guru listened politely, analyzing himself to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> if any shred of
<span class="t3 t7 t9 t10 t15 t19 t22 hoverable">truth</span> lay <span class="t5 t7 hoverable">within</span> the denunciation. These scenes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> <span class="t22 hoverable">bring</span> to my

be tall by cutting off the heads of others!"

The unfailing composure of a saint is impressive beyond any sermon.
"He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; and he that
ruleth his <span class="t0 t1 t3 t5 t7 t8 t13 t16 t18 t20 t21 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> than he that taketh a city." {FN12-23}

I often reflected that my majestic <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> easily have been

fame or worldly achievement. He had chosen instead to storm those

understanding it? . . . Those who have railed at metaphysics as
an occult science will be as ashamed of themselves as those who
railed at chemistry on the ground that pursuit of the philosopher's

CHAPTER: 13

THE SLEEPLESS SAINT

"Please permit me to go to the Himalayas. I hope in unbroken solitude
to achieve continuous <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> communion."

I actually once addressed these ungrateful <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">words</span> to my Master.
Seized by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of the unpredictable delusions which occasionally
assail the devotee, I felt a growing impatience with hermitage
duties and college studies. A feebly extenuating circumstance is
that my proposal was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> when I had been only six months with Sri
Yukteswar. Not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> had I fully surveyed his towering stature.

"Many hillmen live in the Himalayas, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> possess no God-perception."
My guru's answer <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> slowly and simply. "Wisdom is better sought
from a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> of realization than from an inert mountain."

Ignoring Master's plain hint that he, and not a hill, was my teacher,
I repeated my plea. Sri Yukteswar vouchsafed no reply. I <span class="t4 hoverable">took</span> his
silence for consent, a precarious interpretation readily accepted
at one's convenience.

In my Calcutta home that evening, I busied myself with travel
preparations. Tying a few articles inside a blanket, I remembered
a similar bundle, surreptitiously dropped from my attic window a
few <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span> earlier. I wondered if this were to be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">another</span> ill-starred
flight toward the Himalayas.

been high; tonight conscience smote heavily at <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> of leaving
my guru.

The following morning I sought out Behari Pundit, my Sanskrit
professor at Scottish Church College.

"Sir, you have told me of your friendship with a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> disciple of
Lahiri Mahasaya. Please <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> me his address."

"You mean Ram Gopal Muzumdar. I call him the 'sleepless saint.'

He is always awake in an ecstatic consciousness. His home is at
Ranbajpur, near Tarakeswar."

I thanked the pundit, and entrained immediately for Tarakeswar.
I hoped to silence my misgivings by wringing a sanction from the
"sleepless saint" to engage myself in lonely Himalayan meditation.
Behari's friend, I heard, had received illumination after <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span>
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span> of KRIYA YOGA practice in isolated caves.

At Tarakeswar I approached a famous shrine. Hindus regard it with
the same veneration that Catholics <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> to the Lourdes sanctuary in
France. Innumerable healing miracles have occurred at Tarakeswar,
including <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> for a member of my family.

"I sat in the temple there for a week," my eldest aunt once told
me. "Observing a complete fast, I prayed for the recovery of your
Uncle Sarada from a chronic malady. On the seventh <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> I <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> a
herb materialized in my hand! I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> a brew from the leaves, and
gave it to your uncle. His disease vanished at once, and has <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span>
reappeared."

I entered the sacred Tarakeswar shrine; the altar contains <span class="t15 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">nothing</span>
but a round stone. Its circumference, beginningless and endless,
makes it aptly significant of the Infinite. Cosmic abstractions are
not alien <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> to the humblest Indian peasant; he has been accused

by Westerners, in fact, of living on abstractions!

My own mood at the moment was so austere that I felt disinclined
to bow before the stone symbol. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> should be sought, I reflected,
only <span class="t5 t7 hoverable">within</span> the soul.

I left the temple <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> genuflection and walked briskly toward
the outlying village of Ranbajpur. My appeal to a passer-by for
guidance caused him to sink into <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> cogitation.

"When you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> to a crossroad, turn <span class="t27 hoverable">right</span> and keep going," he
finally pronounced oracularly.

Obeying the directions, I wended my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> alongside the banks of
a canal. Darkness fell; the outskirts of the jungle village were
alive with winking fireflies and the howls of near-by jackals. The
moonlight was too faint to supply any reassurance; I stumbled on
for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> hours.

Welcome clang of a cowbell! My repeated shouts eventually <span class="t2 t4 t5 t22 t23 hoverable">brought</span>
a peasant to my side.

"I am looking for Ram Gopal Babu."

"No such <span class="t9 hoverable">person</span> lives in our village." The man's tone was surly.

"You are probably a lying detective."

Hoping to allay suspicion in his politically troubled mind,
I touchingly explained my predicament. He <span class="t4 hoverable">took</span> me to his home and
offered a hospitable welcome.

"Ranbajpur is <span class="t6 t9 t18 t26 hoverable">far</span> from here," he remarked. "At the crossroad, you
should have turned left, not right."

My earlier informant, I <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> sadly, was a distinct menace to
travelers. After a relishable meal of coarse rice, lentil-DHAL,
and curry of potatoes with raw bananas, I retired to a small hut
adjoining the courtyard. In the distance, villagers were singing
to the loud accompaniment of MRIDANGAS {FN13-1} and cymbals. Sleep
was inconsiderable that night; I prayed deeply to be directed to
the secret yogi, Ram Gopal.

As the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> streaks of dawn penetrated the fissures of my dark
room, I <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t15 t17 t18 t19 hoverable">set</span> out for Ranbajpur. Crossing rough paddy fields, I trudged
over sickled stumps of the prickly plant and mounds of dried clay.
An occasionally-met peasant <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> inform me, invariably, that my
destination was "only a KROSHA (two miles)." In six hours the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t14 t23 t25 t28 hoverable">sun</span>
traveled victoriously from horizon to meridian, but I began to feel
that I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> <span class="t29 hoverable">ever</span> be distant from Ranbajpur by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> KROSHA.

At midafternoon my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> was still an endless paddy field. Heat
pouring from the avoidless sky was bringing me to near-collapse. As
a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> approached at leisurely pace, I hardly dared utter my usual
question, lest it summon the monotonous: "Just a KROSHA."

The stranger halted beside me. Short and slight, he was physically
unimpressive save for an extraordinary pair of piercing dark eyes.

"I was planning to leave Ranbajpur, but your purpose was good, so
I awaited you." He shook his finger in my astounded face. "Aren't
you clever to think that, unannounced, you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> pounce on me? That
professor Behari had no <span class="t27 hoverable">right</span> to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> you my address."

Considering that introduction of myself <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be mere verbosity in
the presence of this master, I stood speechless, somewhat hurt at
my reception. His next remark was abruptly put.

"Tell me; where do you think <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> is?"

"Why, He is <span class="t5 t7 hoverable">within</span> me and everywhere." I doubtless looked as
bewildered as I felt.

"All-pervading, eh?" The saint chuckled. "Then why, young sir,
did you fail to bow before the Infinite in the stone symbol at the
Tarakeswar temple yesterday? {FN13-2} Your pride caused you the

punishment of being misdirected by the passer-by who was not bothered
by fine distinctions of left and right. Today, too, you have had
a fairly uncomfortable <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of it!"

I agreed wholeheartedly, wonder-struck that an omniscient eye hid
<span class="t5 t7 hoverable">within</span> the unremarkable <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> before me. Healing strength emanated
from the yogi; I was instantly refreshed in the scorching field.

"The devotee inclines to think his path to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> is the only way," he
said. "Yoga, through which divinity is <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> within, is doubtless
the <span class="t6 t9 t22 t29 hoverable">highest</span> road: so Lahiri Mahasaya has told us. But discovering
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> within, we soon perceive Him without. <span class="t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t12 t15 t19 t20 t23 t25 hoverable">Holy</span> shrines at
Tarakeswar and elsewhere are rightly venerated as nuclear centers
of <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> power."

The saint's censorious attitude vanished; his eyes became
compassionately soft. He patted my shoulder.

"Young yogi, I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> you are running <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">away</span> from your master. He
has everything you need; you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> return to him. Mountains <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">cannot</span>
be your guru." Ram Gopal was repeating the same <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> which Sri
Yukteswar had expressed at our last meeting.

"Masters are under no cosmic compulsion to limit their residence."
My companion glanced at me quizzically. "The Himalayas in India

and Tibet have no monopoly on saints. What <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> does not trouble to
find <span class="t5 t7 hoverable">within</span> will not be discovered by transporting the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> hither
and yon. As soon as the devotee is WILLING to go <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> to the ends
of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> for <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> enlightenment, his guru appears near-by."

I silently agreed, recalling my prayer in the Benares hermitage,
followed by the meeting with Sri Yukteswar in a crowded lane.

"Are you able to have a little room where you can close the door
and be alone?"

"Yes." I reflected that this saint descended from the general to
the particular with disconcerting speed.

"That is your cave." The yogi bestowed on me a gaze of illumination
which I have <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> forgotten. "That is your sacred mountain. That
is where you will find the kingdom of God."

His simple <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">words</span> instantaneously banished my lifelong obsession for
the Himalayas. In a burning paddy field I awoke from the monticolous
dreams of eternal snows.

"Young sir, your <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> thirst is laudable. I feel <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> <span class="t7 hoverable">love</span> for
you." Ram Gopal <span class="t4 hoverable">took</span> my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t29 hoverable">hand</span> and led me to a quaint hamlet. The
adobe houses were covered with coconut leaves and adorned with

rustic entrances.

The saint seated me on the umbrageous bamboo platform of his small
cottage. After giving me sweetened lime juice and a piece of rock
candy, he entered his patio and assumed the lotus posture. In about
four hours I opened my meditative eyes and saw that the moonlit
figure of the yogi was still motionless. As I was sternly reminding
my stomach that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> does not live by bread alone, Ram Gopal approached
me.

"I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> you are famished; food will be ready soon."

A <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> was kindled under a clay oven on the patio; rice and DHAL
were quickly served on large banana leaves. My host courteously
refused my aid in all cooking chores. "The guest is God," a Hindu
proverb, has commanded devout observance from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> immemorial. In
my later <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> travels, I was charmed to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> that a similar respect
for visitors is manifested in rural sections of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> countries.
The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t22 t23 hoverable">city</span> dweller finds the keen edge of hospitality blunted by
superabundance of strange faces.

The marts of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> seemed remotely dim as I squatted by the yogi
in the isolation of the tiny jungle village. The cottage room
was mysterious with a mellow light. Ram Gopal arranged some torn
blankets on the floor for my bed, and seated himself on a straw

mat. Overwhelmed by his <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> magnetism, I ventured a request.

"Sir, why don't you grant me a SAMADHI?"

"Dear one, I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be glad to convey the <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> contact, but it
is not my <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> to do so." The saint looked at me with half-closed
eyes. "Your <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">master</span> will bestow that experience shortly. Your <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span>
is not tuned just yet. As a small lamp <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">cannot</span> withstand excessive
electrical voltage, so your nerves are unready for the cosmic
current. If I gave you the infinite ecstasy <span class="t27 hoverable">right</span> now, you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span>
burn as if <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> cell were on fire.

"You are asking illumination from me," the yogi continued musingly,
"while I am wondering-inconsiderable as I am, and with the little
meditation I have done-if I have succeeded in pleasing God, and
what worth I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> find in His eyes at the final reckoning."

"Sir, have you not been singleheartedly seeking <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> for a <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span>
time?"

"I have not done much. Behari <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> have told you something of
my life. For twenty <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span> I occupied a secret grotto, meditating
eighteen hours a day. Then I moved to a more inaccessible cave
and remained there for twenty-five years, entering the yoga union
for twenty hours daily. I did not need sleep, for I was <span class="t29 hoverable">ever</span>

with God. My <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> was more rested in the complete calmness of the
superconsciousness than it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> be by the partial peace of the
ordinary subconscious state.

"The muscles relax during sleep, but the heart, lungs, and
circulatory system are constantly at work; they get no rest. In
superconsciousness, the internal organs remain in a state of suspended
animation, electrified by the cosmic energy. By such <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t14 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">means</span> I have
<span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> it unnecessary to sleep for years. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> will <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> when
you too will dispense with sleep."

"My goodness, you have meditated for so <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> are unsure
of the Lord's favor!" I gazed at him in astonishment. "Then what
about us poor mortals?"

"Well, don't you see, my dear boy, that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> is Eternity Itself? To

is rather a preposterous expectation. Babaji assures us, however,
that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> a little meditation saves <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> from the dire fear of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span>
and after-death states. Do not fix your <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> ideal on a small
mountain, but hitch it to the star of unqualified <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> attainment.

Enthralled by the prospect, I asked him for further enlightening
words. He related a wondrous story of his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> meeting with Lahiri

Mahasaya's guru, Babaji. {FN13-3} Around midnight Ram Gopal fell
into silence, and I lay down on my blankets. Closing my eyes, I
saw flashes of lightning; the vast space <span class="t5 t7 hoverable">within</span> me was a chamber
of molten light. I opened my eyes and observed the same dazzling
radiance. The room became a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of that infinite vault which I
beheld with interior vision.

"Why don't you go to sleep?"

"Sir, how can I sleep in the presence of lightning, blazing whether
my eyes are shut or open?"

"You are blessed to have this experience; the <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> radiations
are not easily seen." The saint added a few <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">words</span> of affection.

At dawn Ram Gopal gave me rock candies and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> depart. I
felt such reluctance to bid him farewell that tears coursed down
my cheeks.

"I will not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">let</span> you go empty-handed." The yogi spoke tenderly. "I
will do something for you."

He smiled and looked at me steadfastly. I stood rooted to the
ground, peace rushing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> a mighty flood through the gates of my
eyes. I was instantaneously healed of a pain in my back, which had

troubled me intermittently for years. Renewed, bathed in a sea of
luminous joy, I wept no more. After touching the saint's feet, I
sauntered into the jungle, making my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> through its tropical tangle
until I reached Tarakeswar.

myself fully before the altar. The round stone enlarged before
my inner vision until it became the cosmical spheres, ring <span class="t5 t7 hoverable">within</span>
ring, zone after zone, all dowered with divinity.

I entrained happily an hour later for Calcutta. My travels ended,
not in the lofty mountains, but in the Himalayan presence of my
Master.

CHAPTER: 14

AN EXPERIENCE IN COSMIC CONSCIOUSNESS

"I am here, Guruji." My shamefacedness spoke more eloquently for
me.

"Let us go to the kitchen and find something to eat." Sri Yukteswar's
manner was as natural as if hours and not <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t11 t20 t26 t27 hoverable">days</span> had separated us.

"Master, I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> have disappointed you by my abrupt departure from
my duties here; I <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> you <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t18 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">might</span> be angry with me."

"No, of course not! Wrath springs only from thwarted desires. I
do not expect anything from others, so their actions <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">cannot</span> be in
opposition to wishes of mine. I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> not use you for my own ends;

"Sir, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> hears of <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> <span class="t7 hoverable">love</span> in a vague way, but for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span>

We looked into each other's eyes, where tears were shining. A
blissful wave engulfed me; I was conscious that the Lord, in the

form of my guru, was expanding the small ardors of my <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t16 t19 t22 t23 t25 t26 hoverable">heart</span> into
the incompressible reaches of cosmic love.

A few mornings later I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> to Master's empty sitting room.
I planned to meditate, but my laudable purpose was unshared by
disobedient thoughts. They scattered <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> birds before the hunter.

"Mukunda!" Sri Yukteswar's voice sounded from a distant inner
balcony.

I felt as rebellious as my thoughts. "Master always urges me to
meditate," I muttered to myself. "He should not disturb me when he
knows why I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> to his room."

He summoned me again; I remained obstinately silent. The third <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span>
his tone held rebuke.

"Sir, I am meditating," I shouted protestingly.

"I <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">know</span> how you are meditating," my guru <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> out, "with your

Snubbed and exposed, I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> sadly to his side.

"Poor boy, the mountains couldn't <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> what you wanted." <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span>

spoke caressively, comfortingly. His calm gaze was unfathomable.
"Your heart's desire <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> be fulfilled."

Sri Yukteswar seldom indulged in riddles; I was bewildered. He
struck gently on my chest above the heart.

My <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> became immovably rooted; breath was drawn out of my lungs
as if by some huge magnet. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Soul</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> instantly lost their
physical bondage, and streamed out <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> a fluid piercing <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span>

awareness I knew that <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> before had I been fully alive. My sense
of identity was no longer narrowly confined to a body, but embraced
the circumambient atoms. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">People</span> on distant streets seemed to be
moving gently over my own remote periphery. The roots of plants and
trees appeared through a dim transparency of the soil; I discerned
the inward flow of their sap.

The <span class="t3 t5 t7 t9 t20 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> vicinity lay bare before me. My ordinary frontal
vision was now changed to a vast spherical sight, simultaneously
all-perceptive. Through the back of my head I saw <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> strolling <span class="t6 t9 t18 t26 hoverable">far</span>
down Rai Ghat Road, and noticed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> a white cow who was leisurely
approaching. When she reached the space in front of the open ashram
gate, I observed her with my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> physical eyes. As she passed by,
behind the brick wall, I saw her clearly still.

All objects <span class="t5 t7 hoverable">within</span> my panoramic gaze trembled and vibrated <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span>
quick motion pictures. My body, Master's, the pillared courtyard,
the furniture and floor, the trees and sunshine, occasionally became
violently agitated, until all melted into a luminescent sea; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span>
as sugar crystals, thrown into a glass of water, dissolve after
being shaken. The unifying <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> alternated with materializations

in creation.

An oceanic joy broke <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> calm endless shores of my soul. The <span class="t0 t1 t3 t5 t7 t8 t13 t16 t18 t20 t21 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">Spirit</span>
of God, I realized, is exhaustless Bliss; His <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> is countless
tissues of light. A swelling glory <span class="t5 t7 hoverable">within</span> me began to envelop towns,
continents, the earth, solar and stellar systems, tenuous nebulae,
and floating universes. The entire cosmos, gently luminous, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span>
a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t22 t23 hoverable">city</span> seen afar at night, glimmered <span class="t5 t7 hoverable">within</span> the infinitude of
my being. The sharply etched global outlines faded somewhat at the
farthest edges; there I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> a mellow radiance, ever-undiminished.
It was indescribably subtle; the planetary pictures were formed of
a grosser light.

The <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> dispersion of rays poured from an Eternal Source, blazing
into galaxies, transfigured with ineffable auras. Again and again
I saw the creative beams condense into constellations, then resolve
into sheets of transparent flame. By rhythmic reversion, sextillion
worlds passed into diaphanous luster; <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> became firmament.

I cognized the center of the empyrean as a point of intuitive
perception in my heart. Irradiating splendor issued from my nucleus
to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of the universal structure. Blissful AMRITA, the
nectar of immortality, pulsed through me with a quicksilverlike
fluidity. The creative voice of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> I heard resounding as AUM,
{FN14-1} the vibration of the Cosmic Motor.

Suddenly the breath returned to my lungs. With a disappointment
almost unbearable, I realized that my infinite immensity was lost.
Once more I was limited to the humiliating cage of a body, not
easily accommodative to the Spirit. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Like</span> a prodigal child, I had

microcosm.

My guru was standing motionless before me; I started to drop at his
<span class="t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t12 t15 t19 t20 t23 t25 hoverable">holy</span> feet in gratitude for the experience in cosmic consciousness
which I had <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> passionately sought. He held me upright, and spoke
calmly, unpretentiously.

"You <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> not get overdrunk with ecstasy. <span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">Much</span> <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t7 t10 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> remains

I fetched a broom; Master, I knew, was teaching me the secret of

balanced living. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> stretch over the cosmogonic abysses,

for a stroll, I was still entranced in unspeakable rapture. I saw
our bodies as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> astral pictures, moving over a road by the river

A <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">master</span> bestows the <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> experience of cosmic consciousness when
his disciple, by meditation, has strengthened his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> to a degree

an irresistible force. The Lord, as the Cosmic Vision, is drawn by
the seeker's magnetic ardor into his range of consciousness.

I wrote, in my later years, the following poem, "Samadhi," endeavoring
to convey the glory of its cosmic state:

Vanished the veils of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> and shade,

Gone the dim sensory mirage.
Love, hate, health, disease, life, death,
Perished these false shadows on the screen of duality.
Waves of laughter, scyllas of sarcasm, melancholic whirlpools,

Melting in the vast sea of bliss.
The storm of MAYA stilled
By magic wand of intuition deep.
The universe, forgotten dream, subconsciously lurks,
Ready to invade my newly-wakened memory divine.
I live <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> the cosmic shadow,

Dreams, wakings, states of deep TURIA sleep,
Present, past, future, no more for me,
But ever-present, all-flowing I, I, everywhere.
Planets, stars, stardust, earth,
Volcanic bursts of doomsday cataclysms,
Creation's molding furnace,
Glaciers of silent x-rays, burning electron floods,
Thoughts of all men, past, present, to come,

Each particle of universal dust,
Anger, greed, good, bad, salvation, lust,

Smoldering joy, oft-puffed by meditation
Blinding my tearful eyes,

Tranquilled, unbroken thrill, eternally living, ever-new peace!
Enjoyable beyond imagination of expectancy, SAMADHI bliss!
Not an unconscious state

Beyond limits of the mortal frame

By deeper, longer, thirsty, guru-given meditation
Comes this celestial SAMADHI.
Mobile murmurs of atoms are heard,
The dark earth, mountains, vales, lo! molten liquid!
Flowing seas change into vapors of nebulae!
AUM blows <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> vapors, opening wondrously their veils,
Oceans stand revealed, shining electrons,
Till, at last sound of the cosmic drum,
Vanish the grosser lights into eternal rays
Of all-pervading bliss.

From joy I came, for joy I live, in sacred joy I melt.
Ocean of mind, I drink all creation's waves.
Four veils of solid, liquid, vapor, light,
Lift aright.

Gone forever, fitful, flickering shadows of mortal memory.
Spotless is my mental sky, below, ahead, and high above.
Eternity and I, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> united ray.
A tiny bubble of laughter, I

"O no, sir, I don't think so!"

My guru was smiling. "I am sure you aren't expecting a venerable

CHAPTER: 15

THE CAULIFLOWER ROBBERY

"Master, a gift for you! These six huge cauliflowers were planted

with my hands; I have watched over their growth with the tender
care of a mother nursing her child." I presented the basket of
vegetables with a ceremonial flourish.

"Thank you!" Sri Yukteswar's smile was warm with appreciation.
"Please keep them in your room; I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> need them tomorrow for a
special dinner."

I had just arrived in Puri {FN15-1} to spend my college summer
vacation with my guru at his seaside hermitage. Built by <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span>
and his disciples, the cheerful little two-storied retreat fronts
on the Bay of Bengal.

I awoke early the following morning, refreshed by the salty sea
breezes and the charm of my surroundings. Sri Yukteswar's melodious
voice was calling; I <span class="t4 hoverable">took</span> a look at my cherished cauliflowers and
stowed them neatly under my bed.

"Come, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">let</span> us go to the beach." <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> led the way; several young
disciples and myself followed in a scattered group. Our guru surveyed
us in mild criticism.

"When our Western brothers walk, they usually <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">take</span> pride in unison.
Now, please march in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> rows; keep rhythmic step with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> another."
Sri Yukteswar watched as we obeyed; he began to sing: "Boys go to

and fro, in a pretty little row." I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> not but admire the ease
with which <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> was able to match the brisk pace of his young
students.

"Halt!" My guru's eyes sought mine. "Did you remember to lock the
back door of the hermitage?"

[Illustration: MY GURU'S SEASIDE HERMITAGE AT PURI A steady stream
of visitors poured from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> into the hermitage tranquillity.

orthodox religionist. A supercilious smile or a glance of amused
tolerance occasionally betreayed that the newcomers anticipated
<span class="t15 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">nothing</span> more than a few pious platitudes. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> their reluctant

shown precise insight into their specialized fields of knowledge.
My guru always had young resident disciples in his hermitage.
He directed their minds and lives with that careful discipline in
which the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">word</span> "disciple" is etymologically rooted.--see puri.jpg]

"I think so, sir."

Sri Yukteswar was silent for a few minutes, a half-suppressed smile
on his lips. "No, you forgot," he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> finally. "Divine contemplation

I <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> he was obscurely joking when he added: "Your six cauliflowers
will soon be only five."

We turned around at Master's orders and marched back until we were
close to the hermitage.

"Rest awhile. Mukunda, look across the compound on our left; observe
the road beyond. A <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> will arrive there presently; he will
be the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t14 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">means</span> of your chastisement."

I concealed my vexation at these incomprehensible remarks. A peasant
soon appeared on the road; he was dancing grotesquely and flinging
his arms about with meaningless gestures. Almost paralyzed with
curiosity, I glued my eyes on the hilarious spectacle. As the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span>
reached a point in the road where he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> vanish from our view,
Sri Yukteswar said, "Now, he will return."

The peasant at once changed his direction and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> for the rear
of the ashram. Crossing a sandy tract, he entered the building by
the back door. I had left it unlocked, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> as my guru had said.
The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> emerged shortly, holding <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of my prized cauliflowers. He
now strode along respectably, invested with the dignity of possession.

The unfolding farce, in which my role appeared to be that of bewildered

victim, was not so disconcerting that I failed in indignant pursuit.
I was halfway to the road when <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> recalled me. He was shaking
from head to foot with laughter.

"That poor crazy <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> has been longing for a cauliflower," he explained
between outbursts of mirth. "I <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> idea if
he got <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of yours, so ill-guarded!"

I dashed to my room, where I <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> that the thief, evidently <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span>
with a vegetable fixation, had left untouched my gold rings, watch,
and money, all lying openly on the blanket. He had crawled instead
under the bed where, completely hidden from casual sight, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of
my cauliflowers had aroused his singlehearted desire.

I asked Sri Yukteswar that evening to explain the incident which
had, I thought, a few baffling features.

My guru shook his head slowly. "You will understand it someday.
Science will soon discover a few of these hidden laws."

When the wonders of radio burst some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span> later on an astounded
world, I remembered Master's prediction. Age-old concepts of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span>
and space were annihilated; no peasant's home so narrow that London
or Calcutta <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> not enter! The dullest <span class="t20 hoverable">intelligence</span> enlarged
before indisputable proof of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> aspect of man's omnipresence.

The "plot" of the cauliflower comedy can be best understood by a
radio analogy. Sri Yukteswar was a perfect <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> radio. Thoughts
are no more than very gentle vibrations moving in the ether. Just
as a sensitized radio picks up a desired musical number out of
thousands of other programs from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> direction, so my guru had
been able to catch the <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> of the half-witted <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> who hankered
for a cauliflower, out of the countless thoughts of broadcasting
<span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> wills in the world. {FN15-2} By his powerful will, <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> was
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> a <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> broadcasting station, and had successfully directed
the peasant to reverse his steps and go to a <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> room for a
single cauliflower.

Intuition {FN15-3} is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> guidance, appearing naturally in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> during
those instants when his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> is calm. Nearly everyone has had the
experience of an inexplicably correct "hunch," or has transferred
his thoughts effectively to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">another</span> person.

The <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> mind, free from the static of restlessness, can perform
through its antenna of intuition all the functions of complicated
radio mechanisms-sending and receiving thoughts, and tuning out
undesirable ones. As the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of a radio depends on the amount of
electrical current it can utilize, so the <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> radio is energized
<span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">according</span> to the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of will possessed by each individual.

All thoughts vibrate eternally in the cosmos. By deep concentration, a
<span class="t6 t18 hoverable">master</span> is able to detect the thoughts of any mind, living or dead.
Thoughts are universally and not individually rooted; a <span class="t3 t7 t9 t10 t15 t19 t22 hoverable">truth</span>
<span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">cannot</span> be created, but only perceived. The erroneous thoughts of
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> result from imperfections in his discernment. The goal of yoga
science is to calm the mind, that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> distortion it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> mirror
the <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> vision in the universe.

Radio and television have <span class="t2 t4 t5 t22 t23 hoverable">brought</span> the instantaneous sound and sight
of remote persons to the firesides of millions: the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> faint

ego in most barbaric modes conspires in vain to cramp.

"Very strange, very wonderful, seemingly very improbable phenomena

more than we are now astonished at all that science has taught us
during the last century," Charles Robert Richet, Nobel Prizeman in
physiology, has declared. "It is assumed that the phenomena which
we now accept <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> surprise, do not excite our astonishment
because they are understood. But this is not the case. If they do
not surprise us it is not because they are understood, it is because
they are familiar; for if that which is not understood ought to
surprise us, we should be surprised at everything-the fall of a
stone thrown into the air, the acorn which becomes an oak, mercury

which expands when it is heated, iron attracted by a magnet,
phosphorus which burns when it is rubbed. . . . The science of
today is a <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> matter; the revolutions and evolutions which it
will experience in a hundred thousand <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span> will <span class="t6 t9 t18 t26 hoverable">far</span> exceed the
most daring anticipations. The truths-those surprising, amazing,
unforeseen truths-which our descendants will discover, are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span>
now all around us, staring us in the eyes, so to speak, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span>
we do not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> them. But it is not enough to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">say</span> that we do not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span>

unfamiliar fact appears, we try to fit it into the framework of
the commonplaces of acquired knowledge, and we are indignant that
anyone should dare to experiment further."

A humorous occurrence <span class="t4 hoverable">took</span> <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> a few <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t11 t20 t26 t27 hoverable">days</span> after I had been so
implausibly robbed of a cauliflower. A <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> kerosene lamp <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span>
not be found. Having so lately witnessed my guru's omniscient
insight, I <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> demonstrate that it was child's play
to locate the lamp.

<span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> perceived my expectation. With exaggerated gravity he
questioned all ashram residents. A young disciple confessed that
he had <span class="t27 hoverable">used</span> the lamp to go to the <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t8 t10 t12 t13 t14 t17 t19 t23 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> in the back yard.

Sri Yukteswar gave the solemn counsel: "Seek the lamp near the
well."

I rushed there; no lamp! Crestfallen, I returned to my guru. He
was now laughing heartily, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> compunction for my disillusionment.

"Too bad I couldn't direct you to the vanished lamp; I am not a
fortune teller!" With twinkling eyes, he added, "I am not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> a
satisfactory Sherlock Holmes!"

I realized that <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> display his powers when challenged,
or for a triviality.

Delightful weeks sped by. Sri Yukteswar was planning a religious
procession. He asked me to lead the disciples over the town and
beach of Puri. The festive <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> dawned as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of the hottest of the
summer.

"Guruji, how can I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">take</span> the barefooted students over the fiery
sands?" I spoke despairingly.

"I will tell you a secret," <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> responded. "The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> will send
an umbrella of clouds; you all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> walk in comfort."

I happily organized the procession; our group started from the
ashram with a SAT-SANGA banner. {FN15-4} Designed by Sri Yukteswar,
it bore the symbol of the single {FN15-5} eye, the telescopic gaze

of intuition.

No sooner had we left the hermitage than the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of the sky which
was overhead became filled with clouds as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> by magic. To the
accompaniment of astonished ejaculations from all sides, a very
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> shower fell, cooling the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t22 t23 hoverable">city</span> streets and the burning seashore.
The soothing drops descended during the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> hours of the parade.
The exact instant at which our group returned to the ashram, the
clouds and rain passed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">away</span> tracelessly.

"You <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> how <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> feels for us," <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> replied after I had expressed
my gratitude. "The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> responds to all and <span class="t9 t16 t26 hoverable">works</span> for all. Just as
He sent rain at my plea, so He fulfills any sincere desire of the
devotee.

He is not partial to a few, but listens to everyone who approaches
Him trustingly. His <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">children</span> should <span class="t29 hoverable">ever</span> have implicit faith in
the loving-kindness of their Omnipresent Father." {FN15-6}

Sri Yukteswar sponsored four yearly festivals, at the equinoxes
and solstices, when his students gathered from <span class="t6 t9 t18 t26 hoverable">far</span> and near. The
winter solstice celebration was held in Serampore; the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span>
I attended left me with a permanent blessing.

The festivities started in the morning with a barefoot procession
along the streets. The voices of a hundred students rang out with

sweet religious songs; a few musicians played the flute and KHOL
KARTAL (drums and cymbals). Enthusiastic townspeople strewed the
path with flowers, glad to be summoned from prosaic tasks by our
resounding praise of the Lord's blessed name. The <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> tour ended
in the courtyard of the hermitage. There we encircled our guru,
while students on upper balconies showered us with marigold blossoms.

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Many</span> guests <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> upstairs to receive a pudding of CHANNA and
oranges. I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> to a group of brother disciples who were
serving today as cooks. Food for such large gatherings had to
be cooked outdoors in huge cauldrons. The improvised wood-burning
brick stoves were smoky and tear-provoking, but we laughed merrily
at our work. Religious festivals in India are <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> considered
troublesome; each <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> does his part, supplying money, rice,
vegetables, or his personal services.

<span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> was soon in our midst, supervising the details of the feast.
Busy <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> moment, he kept pace with the most energetic young
student.

A SANKIRTAN (group chanting), accompanied by the harmonium and
hand-played Indian drums, was in progress on the <span class="t6 hoverable">second</span> floor. Sri
Yukteswar listened appreciatively; his musical sense was acutely
perfect.

"They are off key!" <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> left the cooks and joined the artists.
The melody was heard again, this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> correctly rendered.

In India, music as <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t8 t10 t12 t13 t14 t17 t19 t23 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> as painting and the drama is considered a
<span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> art. Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva-the Eternal Trinity-were the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> musicians. The <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Dancer Shiva is scripturally represented
as having worked out the infinite modes of rhythm in His cosmic
dance of universal creation, preservation, and dissolution, while
Brahma accentuated the time-beat with the clanging cymbals, and
Vishnu sounded the <span class="t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t12 t15 t19 t20 t23 t25 hoverable">holy</span> MRIDANGA or drum. Krishna, an incarnation
of Vishnu, is always shown in Hindu art with a flute, on which
he plays the enrapturing song that recalls to their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> home the
<span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> souls wandering in MAYA-delusion. Saraswati, goddess of wisdom,
is symbolized as performing on the VINA, mother of all stringed
instruments. The SAMA VEDA of India contains the world's earliest
writings on musical science.

The foundation stone of Hindu music is the RAGAS or fixed melodic
scales. The six basic RAGAS branch out into 126 derivative RAGINIS
(wives) and PUTRAS (sons). Each RAGA has a minimum of five notes:
a leading <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t9 t12 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">note</span> (VADI or king), a secondary <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t9 t12 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">note</span> (SAMAVADI or prime
minister), helping notes (ANUVADI, attendants), and a dissonant
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t9 t12 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">note</span> (VIVADI, the enemy).

Each <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of the six basic RAGAS has a natural correspondence with

a <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> hour of the day, season of the year, and a presiding
deity who bestows a particular potency. Thus, (1) the HINDOLE RAGA
is heard only at dawn in the spring, to evoke the mood of universal
love; (2) DEEPAKA RAGA is played during the evening in summer, to
arouse compassion; (3) MEGHA RAGA is a melody for midday in the
rainy season, to summon courage; (4) BHAIRAVA RAGA is played in the
mornings of August, September, October, to achieve tranquillity;
(5) SRI RAGA is reserved for autumn twilights, to attain pure love;
(6) MALKOUNSA RAGA is heard at midnights in winter, for valor.

The ancient rishis discovered these laws of sound alliance between
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> and man. Because <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> is an objectification of AUM,
the Primal Sound or Vibratory Word, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> can obtain control over
all natural manifestations through the use of <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> MANTRAS or
chants. {FN15-7} Historical documents tell of the remarkable powers
possessed by Miyan Tan Sen, sixteenth century court musician for
Akbar the Great. Commanded by the Emperor to sing a night RAGA
while the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t14 t23 t25 t28 hoverable">sun</span> was overhead, Tan Sen intoned a MANTRA which instantly
caused the <span class="t3 t5 t7 t9 t20 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> palace precincts to <span class="t8 t13 hoverable">become</span> enveloped in darkness.

Indian music divides the octave into 22 SRUTIS or demi-semitones.
These microtonal intervals permit fine shades of musical expression
unattainable by the Western chromatic scale of 12 semitones. Each
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of the seven basic notes of the octave is associated in Hindu
mythology with a color, and the natural cry of a bird or beast-DO

with green, and the peacock; RE with red, and the skylark; MI with
golden, and the goat; FA with yellowish white, and the heron; SOL
with black, and the nightingale; LA with yellow, and the horse; SI
with a combination of all colors, and the elephant.

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Three</span> scales-major, harmonic minor, melodic minor-are the only
ones which Occidental music employs, but Indian music outlines 72
THATAS or scales. The musician has a creative scope for endless
improvisation around the fixed traditional melody or RAGA; he
concentrates on the sentiment or definitive mood of the structural
theme and then embroiders it to the limits of his own originality.
The Hindu musician does not read <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t15 t17 t18 t19 hoverable">set</span> notes; he clothes anew at each
playing the bare skeleton of the RAGA, often confining himself to
a single melodic sequence, stressing by repetition all its subtle
microtonal and rhythmic variations. Bach, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span> Western composers,
had an understanding of the charm and <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of repetitious sound
slightly differentiated in a hundred complex ways.

Ancient Sanskrit literature describes 120 TALAS or time-measures.
The traditional founder of Hindu music, Bharata, is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to have
isolated 32 kinds of TALA in the song of a lark. The origin of TALA
or rhythm is rooted in <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> movements-the double <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of walking,
and the triple <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of respiration in sleep, when inhalation is
twice the length of exhalation. India has always recognized the
<span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> voice as the most perfect instrument of sound. Hindu music

therefore largely confines itself to the voice range of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span>
octaves. For the same reason, melody (relation of successive notes)
is stressed, rather than harmony (relation of simultaneous notes).

The deeper aim of the early rishi-musicians was to blend the singer
with the Cosmic Song which can be heard through awakening of man's
occult spinal centers. Indian music is a subjective, spiritual,
and individualistic art, aiming not at symphonic brilliance but at
personal harmony with the Oversoul. The Sanskrit <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">word</span> for musician
is BHAGAVATHAR, "he who sings the praises of God." The SANKIRTANS
or musical gatherings are an effective <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of yoga or <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span>
discipline, necessitating deep concentration, intense absorption
in the seed <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> and sound. Because <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> himself is an expression
of the Creative Word, sound has the most potent and immediate effect
on him, offering a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> to remembrance of his <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> origin.

The SANKIRTAN issuing from Sri Yukteswar's second-story sitting
room on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> of the festival was inspiring to the cooks amidst
the steaming pots. My brother disciples and I joyously sang the
refrains, beating <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> with our hands.

By sunset we had served our hundreds of visitors with KHICHURI (rice
and lentils), vegetable curry, and rice pudding. We laid cotton
blankets over the courtyard; soon the assemblage was squatting
under the starry vault, quietly attentive to the wisdom pouring from

Sri Yukteswar's lips. His public speeches emphasized the value of
KRIYA YOGA, and a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of self-respect, calmness, determination,
simple diet, and regular exercise.

A group of very young disciples then chanted a few sacred hymns; the
meeting concluded with SANKIRTAN. From ten o'clock until midnight,
the ashram residents washed pots and pans, and cleared the courtyard.
My guru <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> me to his side.

"I am pleased over your cheerful labors today and during the past
week of preparations. I want you with me; you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> sleep in my bed
tonight."

This was a privilege I had <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> fall to my lot. We
sat awhile in a state of intense <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> tranquillity. Hardly ten
minutes after we had gotten into bed, <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> rose and began to
dress.

"What is the matter, sir?" I felt a tinge of unreality in the
unexpected joy of sleeping beside my guru.

"I think that a few students who missed their proper train connections
will be here soon. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Let</span> us have some food ready."

"Guruji, no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> at <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> o'clock in the morning!"

"Stay in bed; you have been working very hard. But I am going to
cook."

At Sri Yukteswar's resolute tone, I jumped up and followed him to
the small daily-used kitchen adjacent to the second-floor inner
balcony. Rice and DHAL were soon boiling.

My guru smiled affectionately. "Tonight you have conquered fatigue
and fear of hard work; you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> be bothered by them in the
future."

As he uttered these <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">words</span> of lifelong blessing, footsteps sounded
in the courtyard. I ran downstairs and admitted a group of students.

"Dear brother, how reluctant we are to disturb <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> at this hour!"
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">One</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> addressed me apologetically. "We <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> a mistake about train
schedules, but felt we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> not return home <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> a glimpse of
our guru."

"He has been expecting you and is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> now preparing your food."

"Astrology is the study of man's response to planetary stimuli.
The stars have no conscious benevolence or animosity; they merely

and evil-but to arouse man's will to escape from his universal
thralldom. What he has done, he can undo. None other than himself
was the instigator of the causes of whatever effects are now

with Spirit, the less he can be dominated by matter. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> is
ever-free; it is deathless because birthless. It <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">cannot</span> be regimented
by stars.

"Man IS a soul, and HAS a body. When he properly places his sense
of identity, he leaves behind all compulsive patterns. So <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> as
he remains confused in his ordinary state of <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> amnesia, he
will <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">know</span> the subtle fetters of environmental law.

"God is harmony; the devotee who attunes himself will <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> perform
any action amiss. His activities will be correctly and naturally timed
to accord with astrological law. After deep prayer and meditation
he is in touch with his <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> consciousness; there is no greater

"Then, dear Master, why do you want me to wear an astrological
bangle?" I ventured this question after a <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> silence, during
which I had tried to assimilate Sri Yukteswar's noble exposition.

"It is only when a traveler has reached his goal that he is justified

in discarding his maps. During the journey, he takes advantage of
any convenient short cut. The ancient rishis discovered <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> ways
to curtail the period of man's exile in delusion. There are <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span>
mechanical features in the <span class="t0 t8 t12 t15 t19 t23 t25 hoverable">law</span> of karma which can be skillfully
adjusted by the fingers of wisdom.

"All <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> ills arise from some transgression of universal law.
The scriptures point out that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> satisfy the laws of nature,

I trust in Thee, and <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">know</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thou</span> canst help me, but I too will do
my best to undo any wrong I have done.' By a number of means-by
prayer, by will power, by yoga meditation, by consultation with
saints, by use of astrological bangles-the adverse effects of past
wrongs can be minimized or nullified.

"Just as a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> can be fitted with a copper rod to absorb the
shock of lightning, so the bodily temple can be benefited by various
protective measures. Ages ago our yogis discovered that pure metals
emit an astral <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> which is powerfully counteractive to negative
pulls of the planets. Subtle electrical and magnetic radiations
are constantly circulating in the universe; when a man's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> is

he is still in ignorance. Can he do anything about it?

"This problem received attention from our rishis; they <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> helpful

not only a combination of metals, but <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> of plants and-most

preventive uses of astrology have seldom been seriously studied
outside of India. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">One</span> little-known fact is that the proper jewels,
metals, or plant preparations are valueless unless the required
weight is secured, and unless these remedial agents are worn next
to the skin."

"Sir, of course I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">take</span> your advice and get a bangle. I am
intrigued at the <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> of outwitting a planet!"

"For general purposes I counsel the use of an armlet <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> of gold,
silver, and copper. But for a specific purpose I want you to get
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of silver and lead." Sri Yukteswar added careful directions.

"Guruji, what 'specific purpose' do you mean?"

"The stars are about to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">take</span> an unfriendly interest in you, Mukunda.
Fear not; you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> be protected. In about a month your liver will
<span class="t1 t3 t9 t15 t20 t21 t26 t29 hoverable">cause</span> you <span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">much</span> trouble. The illness is scheduled to last for six
months, but your use of an astrological armlet will shorten the
period to twenty-four days."

I sought out a jeweler the next day, and was soon wearing the
bangle. My health was excellent; Master's prediction slipped from

my mind. He left Serampore to visit Benares. Thirty <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t11 t20 t26 t27 hoverable">days</span> after our
conversation, I felt a sudden pain in the region of my liver. The
following weeks were a nightmare of excruciating pain. Reluctant
to disturb my guru, I <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> bravely endure my trial alone.

But twenty-three <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t11 t20 t26 t27 hoverable">days</span> of torture weakened my resolution; I entrained
for Benares. There Sri Yukteswar greeted me with unusual warmth,
but gave me no opportunity to tell him my woes in private. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Many</span>
devotees visited <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> that day, just for a DARSHAN. {FN16-2}
Ill and neglected, I sat in a corner. It was not until after the
evening meal that all guests had departed. My guru summoned me to
the octagonal balcony of the house.

"You <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> have <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> about your liver disorder." Sri Yukteswar's
gaze was averted; he walked to and fro, occasionally intercepting
the moonlight. "Let me see; you have been ailing for twenty-four
days, haven't you?"

"Yes, sir."

"Please do the stomach exercise I have taught you."

"If you knew the extent of my suffering, Master, you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> not ask
me to exercise." Nevertheless I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> a feeble attempt to obey him.

"You <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">say</span> you have pain; I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">say</span> you have none. How can such contradictions
exist?" My guru looked at me inquiringly.

I was dazed and then overcome with joyful relief. No longer <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span>
I feel the continuous torment that had kept me nearly sleepless
for weeks; at Sri Yukteswar's <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">words</span> the agony vanished as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span>
it had <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> been.

I started to kneel at his feet in gratitude, but he quickly prevented
me.

"Don't be childish. Get up and enjoy the beauty of the moon over
the Ganges." But Master's eyes were twinkling happily as I stood
in silence beside him. I understood by his attitude that he wanted
me to feel that not he, but God, had been the Healer.

I wear <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> now the heavy silver and lead bangle, a memento of that
day-long-past, ever-cherished-when I <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> anew that I was living
with a personage indeed superhuman. On later occasions, when
I <span class="t2 t4 t5 t22 t23 hoverable">brought</span> my friends to Sri Yukteswar for healing, he invariably
recommended jewels or the bangle, extolling their use as an act of
astrological wisdom.

I had been prejudiced against astrology from my childhood, partly
because I observed that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> are sequaciously attached to it,

and partly because of a prediction <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> by our family astrologer:
"You will marry <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> times, being twice a widower." I brooded
over the matter, feeling <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> a goat awaiting <span class="t27 hoverable">sacrifice</span> before the
temple of triple matrimony.

"You <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> as <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t8 t10 t12 t13 t14 t17 t19 t23 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> be resigned to your fate," my brother Ananta had
remarked. "Your <span class="t23 hoverable">written</span> horoscope has correctly stated that you
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> fly from home toward the Himalayas during your early years,
but <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be forcibly returned. The forecast of your marriages is

A clear intuition <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> to me <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> night that the prophecy was wholly
false. I <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t15 t17 t18 t19 hoverable">set</span> <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> to the horoscope scroll, placing the ashes in a
paper bag on which I wrote: "Seeds of past karma <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">cannot</span> germinate
if they are roasted in the <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> fires of wisdom." I <span class="t0 t2 t16 t18 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">put</span> the bag
in a conspicuous spot; Ananta immediately read my defiant comment.

"You <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">cannot</span> destroy <span class="t3 t7 t9 t10 t15 t19 t22 hoverable">truth</span> as easily as you have burnt this paper
scroll." My brother laughed scornfully.

It is a fact that on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> occasions before I reached manhood, my
family tried to arrange my betrothal. Each <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> I refused to fall
in with the plans, {FN16-3} knowing that my <span class="t7 hoverable">love</span> for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> was more
overwhelming than any astrological persuasion from the past.

"The deeper the self-realization of a man, the more he influences
the <span class="t3 t5 t7 t9 t20 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> universe by his subtle <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> vibrations, and the
less he himself is affected by the phenomenal flux." These <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">words</span>
of Master's often returned inspiringly to my mind.

Occasionally I told astrologers to select my worst periods, <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">according</span>
to planetary indications, and I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> still accomplish whatever
task I <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t15 t17 t18 t19 hoverable">set</span> myself. It is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> that my success at such times has
been accompanied by extraordinary difficulties. But my conviction
has always been justified: faith in the <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> protection, and the
<span class="t27 hoverable">right</span> use of man's God-given will, are forces formidable beyond
any the "inverted bowl" can muster.

The starry inscription at one's birth, I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> to understand, is not
that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> is a puppet of his past. Its message is rather a prod to
pride; the very heavens seek to arouse man's determination to be
free from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> limitation. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> created each <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> as a soul, dowered
with individuality, hence essential to the universal structure,
whether in the temporary role of pillar or parasite. His freedom

Sri Yukteswar discovered the mathematical application of a 24,000-year
equinoctial cycle to our present age. {FN16-4} The cycle is divided
into an Ascending Arc and a Descending Arc, each of 12,000 years.

Within each Arc fall four YUGAS or Ages, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> KALI, DWAPARA,
TRETA, and SATYA, corresponding to the Greek ideas of Iron, Bronze,
Silver, and Golden Ages.

My guru determined by various calculations that the last KALI YUGA
or Iron Age, of the Ascending Arc, started about A.D. 500. The Iron
Age, 1200 <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span> in duration, is a span of materialism; it ended
about A.D. 1700. That year ushered in DWAPARA YUGA, a 2400-year
period of electrical and atomic-energy developments, the age of
telegraph, radio, airplanes, and other space-annihilators.

The 3600-year period of TRETA YUGA will start in A.D. 4100; its
age will be marked by common <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of telepathic communications
and other time-annihilators. During the 4800 <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span> of SATYA YUGA,

A descending arc of 12,000 years, starting with a descending
Golden Age of 4800 years, then begins {FN16-5} for the world; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span>

of MAYA, the contrasts and relativities of the phenomenal universe.

world's scriptures. Placing the <span class="t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t12 t15 t19 t20 t23 t25 hoverable">holy</span> texts on the spotless table of
his mind, he was able to dissect them with the scalpel of intuitive
reasoning, and to separate errors and interpolations of scholars
from the truths as originally expressed by the prophets.

"Fix one's vision on the <span class="t7 t10 t15 t25 hoverable">end</span> of the nose." This inaccurate

Chunder Roy implied that he was humoring the whim of half-wits. I
concealed my indignation, in the best traditions of the proselyter.

My companion, a veterinary surgeon, was a confirmed agnostic. His
young <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> Santosh had implored me to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">take</span> an interest in his father.
So <span class="t6 t9 t18 t26 hoverable">far</span> my invaluable aid had been a bit on the invisible side.

Dr. Roy accompanied me the following <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> to the Serampore hermitage.
After <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> had granted him a brief interview, marked for the most
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> by stoic silence on both sides, the visitor brusquely departed.

"Why <span class="t22 hoverable">bring</span> a dead <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> to the ashram?" Sri Yukteswar looked at me
inquiringly as soon as the door had closed on the Calcutta skeptic.

"Sir! The doctor is very <span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">much</span> alive!"

"But in a short <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> he will be dead."

After a silence, during which I wondered how Santosh and I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span>

"As soon as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> gets well, advise him not to eat meat. He will

not heed this counsel, however, and in six months, just as he is

The following <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> I suggested to Santosh that he <span class="t0 t6 t7 t8 t11 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">order</span> an armlet
at the jeweler's. It was ready in a week, but Dr. Roy refused to
<span class="t0 t2 t16 t18 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">put</span> it on.

"I am in the best of health. You will <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> impress me with these
astrological superstitions." The doctor glanced at me belligerently.

I recalled with amusement that <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> had justifiably compared
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> to a balky horse. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Another</span> seven <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t11 t20 t26 t27 hoverable">days</span> passed; the doctor,

the physician in attendance told me that his patient's case was
hopeless. He supplied harrowing details of the ravages inflicted
by diabetes.

I shook my head. "My guru has <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> that, after a sickness lasting

The physician stared at me incredulously. But he sought me out a
fortnight later, with an apologetic air.

"Dr. Roy has <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> a complete recovery!" he exclaimed. "It is the

on the piazza of my family home on Gurpar Road.

"Tell your teacher that by eating meat frequently, I have wholly
regained my strength. His unscientific ideas on diet have not
influenced me." It was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> that Dr. Roy looked a picture of health.

But the next <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> Santosh <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> running to me from his home on the

This case was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of my strangest experiences with Master. He

his kindness when confronted by the urgent prayer of a devotee.

It was my proudest privilege to <span class="t22 hoverable">bring</span> college friends to meet my
guru. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Many</span> of them <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> lay aside-at least in the ashram!-their
fashionable academic cloak of religious skepticism.

One of my friends, Sasi, spent a number of happy week ends in
Serampore. <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> became immensely fond of the boy, and lamented
that his private <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> was wild and disorderly.

"Sasi, unless you reform, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> year hence you will be dangerously
ill." Sri Yukteswar gazed at my friend with affectionate exasperation.
"Mukunda is the witness: don't <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">say</span> later that I didn't warn you."

Sasi laughed. "Master, I will leave it to you to interest a sweet
charity of cosmos in my own sad case! My <span class="t0 t1 t3 t5 t7 t8 t13 t16 t18 t20 t21 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> is willing but my
will is weak. You are my only savior on earth; I believe in <span class="t15 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">nothing</span>
else."

"At least you should wear a two-carat blue sapphire. It will help
you."

"I can't afford one. Anyhow, dear guruji, if trouble comes, I fully
believe you will protect me."

"In a year you will <span class="t22 hoverable">bring</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> sapphires," Sri Yukteswar replied
cryptically. "They will be of no use then."

Variations on this conversation <span class="t4 hoverable">took</span> <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> regularly. "I can't
reform!" Sasi <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">say</span> in comical despair. "And my trust in you,

Master, is more precious to me than any stone!"

A year later I was visiting my guru at the Calcutta home of his
disciple, Naren Babu. About ten o'clock in the morning, as Sri
Yukteswar and I were sitting quietly in the second-floor parlor,
I heard the front door open. <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> straightened stiffly.

"It is that Sasi," he remarked gravely. "The year is now up; both
his lungs are gone. He has ignored my counsel; tell him I don't
want to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> him."

Half stunned by Sri Yukteswar's sternness, I raced down the stairway.
Sasi was ascending.

"O Mukunda! I do hope <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> is here; I had a hunch he <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t18 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">might</span> be."

"Yes, but he doesn't wish to be disturbed."

Sasi burst into tears and brushed past me. He threw himself at Sri
Yukteswar's feet, placing there <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> beautiful sapphires.

"Omniscient guru, the doctors <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">say</span> I have galloping tuberculosis!
They <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> me no longer than <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> more months! I humbly implore
your aid; I <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">know</span> you can heal me!"

"Isn't it a bit late now to be worrying over your life? Depart
with your jewels; their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of usefulness is past." <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> then
sat sphinxlike in an unrelenting silence, punctuated by the boy's
sobs for mercy.

An intuitive conviction <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> to me that Sri Yukteswar was merely
testing the depth of Sasi's faith in the <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> healing power. I was
not surprised a tense hour later when <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> turned a sympathetic
gaze on my prostrate friend.

"Get up, Sasi; what a commotion you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> in other people's houses!
Return your sapphires to the jeweler's; they are an unnecessary
expense now. But get an astrological bangle and wear it. Fear not;
in a few weeks you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> be well."

Sasi's smile illumined his tear-marred face <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> sudden <span class="t0 t8 t11 t14 t23 t25 t28 hoverable">sun</span> over
a sodden landscape. "Beloved guru, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">take</span> the medicines
prescribed by the doctors?"

Sri Yukteswar's glance was longanimous. "Just as you wish-drink
them or discard them; it does not matter. It is more possible for
the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t14 t23 t25 t28 hoverable">sun</span> and moon to interchange their positions than for you to
die of tuberculosis." He added abruptly, "Go now, before I change
my mind!"

With an agitated bow, my friend hastily departed. I visited him
several times during the next few weeks, and was aghast to find
his condition increasingly worse.

"Sasi <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">cannot</span> last through the night." These <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">words</span> from his physician,
and the spectacle of my friend, now reduced almost to a skeleton,
sent me posthaste to Serampore. My guru listened coldly to my
tearful report.

"Why do you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> here to bother me? You have already heard me assure
Sasi of his recovery."

I bowed before him in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> awe, and retreated to the door. Sri
Yukteswar <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> no parting word, but sank into silence, his unwinking
eyes half-open, their vision fled to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">another</span> world.

I returned at once to Sasi's home in Calcutta. With astonishment
I <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> my friend sitting up, drinking milk.

"O Mukunda! What a miracle! Four hours ago I felt Master's presence
in the room; my terrible symptoms immediately disappeared. I feel
that through his grace I am entirely well."

In a few weeks Sasi was stouter and in better health than <span class="t29 hoverable">ever</span>
before. {FN17-1} But his singular reaction to his healing had an

ungrateful tinge: he seldom visited Sri Yukteswar again! My friend
told me <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> that he so deeply regretted his previous mode of
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> that he was ashamed to face Master.

I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> only conclude that Sasi's illness had had the contrasting
effect of stiffening his will and impairing his manners.

The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span> of my course at Scottish Church College were
drawing to a close. My classroom attendance had been very spasmodic;
what little studying I did was only to keep peace with my family.
My <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> private tutors <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> regularly to my house; I was regularly
absent: I can discern at least this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> regularity in my scholastic
career!

In India <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> successful <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span> of college <span class="t22 hoverable">bring</span> an Intermediate Arts
diploma; the student <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> then look forward to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">another</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span>
and his A.B. degree.

The Intermediate Arts final examinations loomed ominously ahead.
I fled to Puri, where my guru was spending a few weeks. Vaguely
hoping that he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> sanction my nonappearance at the finals, I
related my embarrassing unpreparedness.

But <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> smiled consolingly. "You have wholeheartedly pursued
your <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> duties, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> not help neglecting your college

work. Apply yourself diligently to your books for the next week:
you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> get through your ordeal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> failure."

I returned to Calcutta, firmly suppressing all reasonable doubts
that occasionally arose with unnerving ridicule. Surveying the
mountain of books on my table, I felt <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> a traveler lost in a
wilderness. A <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> period of meditation <span class="t2 t4 t5 t22 t23 hoverable">brought</span> me a labor-saving
inspiration. Opening each <span class="t25 hoverable">book</span> at random, I studied only those
pages which lay <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> exposed. Pursuing this course during eighteen
hours a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> for a week, I considered myself entitled to advise all
succeeding generations on the art of cramming.

The following <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t11 t20 t26 t27 hoverable">days</span> in the examination halls were a justification
of my seemingly haphazard procedure. I passed all the tests, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span>
by a hairbreadth. The congratulations of my friends and family were
ludicrously mixed with ejaculations betraying their astonishment.

On his return from Puri, Sri Yukteswar gave me a pleasant surprise.
"Your Calcutta studies are now over. I will <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> that you pursue

I was puzzled. "Sir, there is no Bachelor of Arts course in this
town." Serampore College, the sole institution of higher learning,
offered only a two-year course in Intermediate Arts.

Master smiled mischievously. "I am too <span class="t25 hoverable">old</span> to go about collecting
donations to establish an A.B. college for you. I guess I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span>
have to arrange the matter through someone else."

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Two</span> months later Professor Howells, president of Serampore College,
publicly announced that he had succeeded in raising sufficient
funds to offer a four-year course. Serampore College became a branch
affiliation of the University of Calcutta. I was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span>
students to enroll in Serampore as an A.B. candidate.

"Guruji, how kind you are to me! I have been longing to leave
Calcutta and be near you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> in Serampore. Professor Howells
does not dream how <span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">much</span> he owes to your silent help!"

Sri Yukteswar gazed at me with mock severity. "Now you won't have
to spend so <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> hours on trains; what a lot of free <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> for your
studies! Perhaps you will <span class="t8 t13 hoverable">become</span> less of a last-minute crammer and
more of a scholar." But somehow his tone lacked conviction.

{FN17-1} In 1936 I heard from a friend that Sasi was still in
excellent health.

A MOHAMMEDAN WONDER-WORKER

"Years ago, <span class="t27 hoverable">right</span> in this very room you now occupy, a Mohammedan
wonder-worker performed four miracles before me!"

Sri Yukteswar <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> this surprising statement during his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> visit
to my <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> quarters. Immediately after entering Serampore College,
I had <span class="t19 hoverable">taken</span> a room in a near-by boardinghouse, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> PANTHI. It
was an old-fashioned brick mansion, fronting the Ganges.

"Master, what a coincidence! Are these newly decorated walls really
ancient with memories?" I looked around my simply furnished room
with awakened interest.

"It is a <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> story." My guru smiled reminiscently. "The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> of
the FAKIR {FN18-1} was Afzal Khan. He had acquired his extraordinary
powers through a chance encounter with a Hindu yogi.

"'Son, I am thirsty; fetch me some water.' A dust-covered SANNYASI

small village of eastern Bengal.

"'Master, I am a Mohammedan. How <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> you, a Hindu, accept a drink

"'Your truthfulness pleases me, my child. I do not observe
the ostracizing rules of ungodly sectarianism. Go; <span class="t22 hoverable">bring</span> me <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span>
quickly.'

"Afzal's reverent obedience was rewarded by a loving glance from
the yogi.

"'You possess <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> karma from former lives,' he observed solemnly.

of your previous karma is such that you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> use this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> to

goals.'

"After instructing the amazed boy in a complicated technique, the
<span class="t6 t18 hoverable">master</span> vanished.

"Afzal faithfully followed his yoga exercise for twenty years. His
miraculous feats began to attract widespread attention. It seems that
he was always accompanied by a disembodied <span class="t0 t1 t3 t5 t7 t8 t13 t16 t18 t20 t21 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> whom he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span>

'Hazrat.' This invisible entity was able to fulfill the FAKIR'S
slightest wish.

"Ignoring his master's warning, Afzal began to misuse his powers.
Whatever object he touched and then replaced <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> soon disappear
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> a trace. This disconcerting eventuality usually <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> the
Mohammedan an objectionable guest!

"He visited large jewelry stores in Calcutta from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> to time,
representing himself as a possible purchaser. Any jewel he handled
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> vanish shortly after he had left the shop.

"Afzal was often surrounded by several hundred students, attracted
by the hope of learning his secrets. The FAKIR occasionally invited
them to travel with him. At the railway station he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> manage
to touch a roll of tickets. These he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> return to the clerk,
remarking: 'I have changed my mind, and won't buy them now.'
But when he boarded the train with his retinue, Afzal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be in
possession of the required tickets. {FN18-2}

"These exploits created an indignant uproar; Bengali jewelers and
ticket-sellers were succumbing to nervous breakdowns! The police
who sought to arrest Afzal <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> themselves helpless; the FAKIR
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> remove incriminating evidence merely by saying: 'Hazrat, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">take</span>
this away.'"

Sri Yukteswar rose from his seat and walked to the balcony of my
room which overlooked the Ganges. I followed him, eager to hear
more of the baffling Mohammedan Raffles.

"This PANTHI <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> formerly belonged to a friend of mine. He became
acquainted with Afzal and asked him here. My friend <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> invited
about twenty neighbors, including myself. I was only a youth then,
and felt a lively curiosity about the notorious FAKIR." <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span>
laughed. "I <span class="t4 hoverable">took</span> the precaution of not wearing anything valuable!
Afzal looked me over inquisitively, then remarked:

"'You have powerful hands. Go downstairs to the garden; get a
smooth stone and write your <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> on it with chalk; then throw the
stone as <span class="t6 t9 t18 t26 hoverable">far</span> as possible into the Ganges.'

"I obeyed. As soon as the stone had vanished under distant waves,
the Mohammedan addressed me again:

"'Fill a pot with Ganges <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> near the front of this house.'

"After I had returned with a vessel of water, the FAKIR cried,
'Hazrat, <span class="t0 t2 t16 t18 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">put</span> the stone in the pot!'

"The stone appeared at once. I pulled it from the vessel and <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span>

my signature as legible as when I had <span class="t23 hoverable">written</span> it.

"Babu, {FN18-3} <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of my friends in the room, was wearing a heavy
antique gold watch and chain. The FAKIR examined them with ominous
admiration. Soon they were missing!

"'Afzal, please return my prized heirloom!' Babu was nearly in
tears.

"The Mohammedan was stoically silent for awhile, then said, 'You
have five hundred rupees in an iron safe. <span class="t22 hoverable">Bring</span> them to me, and I
will tell you where to locate your timepiece.'

"The distraught Babu left immediately for his home. He <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> back
shortly and handed Afzal the required sum.

"'Go to the little bridge near your house,' the FAKIR instructed
Babu. 'Call on Hazrat to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> you the watch and chain.'

"Babu rushed away. On his return, he was wearing a smile of relief
and no jewelry whatever.

"'When I commanded Hazrat as directed,' he announced, 'my watch
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> tumbling down from the air into my <span class="t27 hoverable">right</span> hand! You <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be sure
I locked the heirloom in my safe before rejoining the group here!'

"Babu's friends, witnesses of the comicotragedy of the ransom for a
watch, were staring with resentment at Afzal. He now spoke placatingly.

"'Please <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> any drink you want; Hazrat will produce it.'

"A number asked for milk, <span class="t1 t7 t13 hoverable">others</span> for fruit juices. I was not too
<span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">much</span> shocked when the unnerved Babu requested whisky! The Mohammedan
gave an order; the obliging Hazrat sent sealed containers sailing
down the air and thudding to the floor. Each <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> his desired
beverage.

"The promise of the fourth spectacular feat of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> was doubtless
gratifying to our host: Afzal offered to supply an instantaneous
lunch!

"'Let us <span class="t0 t6 t7 t8 t11 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">order</span> the most expensive dishes,' Babu suggested gloomily.
'I want an elaborate meal for my five hundred rupees! Everything
should be served on gold plates!'

"As soon as each <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> had expressed his preferences, the FAKIR addressed
himself to the inexhaustible Hazrat. A <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> rattle ensued; gold
platters filled with intricately-prepared curries, hot LUCHIS, and
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> out-of-season fruits, landed from nowhere at our feet. All
the food was delicious. After feasting for an hour, we started to

leave the room. A tremendous noise, as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> dishes were being
piled up, caused us to turn around. Lo! there was no sign of the
glittering plates or the remnants of the meal."

"Guruji," I interrupted, "if Afzal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> easily secure such <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span>
as gold dishes, why did he covet the property of others?"

"The FAKIR was not highly developed spiritually," Sri Yukteswar
explained. "His mastery of a <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> yoga technique gave him access
to an astral plane where any desire is immediately materialized.
Through the agency of an astral being, Hazrat, the Mohammedan <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span>
summon the atoms of any object from etheric energy by an act of
powerful will. But such astrally-produced objects are structurally
evanescent; they <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">cannot</span> be <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> retained. Afzal still yearned for
worldly wealth which, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> more hardly earned, has a more dependable
durability."

I laughed. "It too sometimes vanishes most unaccountably!"

"Afzal was not a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> of God-realization," <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> on.

because they have attuned themselves to the omnipotent Creator.
Afzal was merely an ordinary <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> with an extraordinary <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of
penetrating a subtle realm not usually entered by mortals until
death."

"I understand now, Guruji. The after-world appears to have some
charming features."

<span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> agreed. "I <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> saw Afzal after that day, but a few <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span>
later Babu <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> to my home to show me a newspaper account of the
Mohammedan's public confession. From it I learned the facts I have
just told you about Afzal's early initiation from a Hindu guru."

The gist of the latter <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of the published document, as recalled
by Sri Yukteswar, was as follows: "I, Afzal Khan, am writing these

possession of miraculous powers. For <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span> I have been misusing the
wondrous abilities imparted to me through the grace of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> and my
master. I became drunk with egotism, feeling that I was beyond the
ordinary laws of morality. My <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> of reckoning finally arrived.

"Recently I met an <span class="t25 hoverable">old</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> on a road outside Calcutta. He limped
along painfully, carrying a shining object which looked <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> gold.
I addressed him with greed in my heart.

"'I am Afzal Khan, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> FAKIR. What have you there?'

"'This ball of gold is my sole material wealth; it can be of no
interest to a FAKIR. I implore you, sir, to heal my limp.'

"I touched the ball and walked <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">away</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> reply.

hobbled after me. He soon raised an outcry: 'My gold is gone!'

"As I paid no attention, he suddenly spoke in a stentorian voice
that issued oddly from his frail body:

"'Do you not recognize me?'

"I stood speechless, aghast at the belated discovery that this
unimpressive <span class="t25 hoverable">old</span> cripple was none other than the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> saint who,
long, <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> ago, had initiated me into yoga. He straightened himself;
his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> instantly became strong and youthful.

"'So!' My guru's glance was fiery. 'I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> with my own eyes that
you use your powers, not to help suffering humanity, but to prey
on it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> a common thief! I withdraw your occult gifts; Hazrat is

"I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> on Hazrat in anguished tones; for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> time, he did
not appear to my inner sight. But some dark veil suddenly lifted
<span class="t5 t7 hoverable">within</span> me; I saw clearly the blasphemy of my life.

"'My guru, I thank you for coming to banish my <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> delusion.' I
was sobbing at his feet. 'I promise to forsake my worldly ambitions.

I will retire to the mountains for lonely meditation on God, hoping
to atone for my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> past.'

"My <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">master</span> regarded me with silent compassion. 'I feel your
sincerity,' he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> finally. 'Because of your earlier <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span> of

"My guru then vanished; I was left to my tears and reflections.
Farewell, world! I go to seek the forgiveness of the Cosmic Beloved."

CHAPTER: 19

MY MASTER, IN CALCUTTA, APPEARS IN SERAMPORE

"I am often beset by atheistic doubts. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> a torturing surmise
sometimes haunts me: <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> not untapped <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> possibilities exist? Is
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> not missing his real destiny if he fails to explore them?"

These remarks of Dijen Babu, my roommate at the PANTHI boardinghouse,
were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> <span class="t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t9 t10 t11 t13 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">forth</span> by my invitation that he meet my guru.

"Sri Yukteswarji will initiate you into KRIYA YOGA," I replied.
"It calms the dualistic turmoil by a <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> inner certainty."

That evening Dijen accompanied me to the hermitage. In Master's
presence my friend received such <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> peace that he was soon
a constant visitor. The trivial preoccupations of daily <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> are not
enough for man; wisdom too is a native hunger. In Sri Yukteswar's
<span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">words</span> Dijen <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> an incentive to those attempts-first painful,
then effortlessly liberating-to locate a realer <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">self</span> <span class="t5 t7 hoverable">within</span> his
bosom than the humiliating ego of a temporary birth, seldom ample
enough for the Spirit.

As Dijen and I were both pursuing the A.B. course at Serampore
College, we got into the habit of walking <span class="t16 t21 hoverable">together</span> to the ashram

as soon as classes were over. We <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> often <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> Sri Yukteswar
standing on his second-floor balcony, welcoming our approach with
a smile.

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">One</span> afternoon Kanai, a young hermitage resident, met Dijen and me
at the door with disappointing news.

"Master is not here; he was summoned to Calcutta by an urgent note."

The following <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> I received a post card from my guru. "I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span>
leave Calcutta Wednesday morning," he had written. "You and Dijen
meet the nine o'clock train at Serampore station."

About eight-thirty on Wednesday morning, a telepathic message from
Sri Yukteswar flashed insistently to my mind: "I am delayed; don't
meet the nine o'clock train."

I conveyed the latest instructions to Dijen, who was already dressed
for departure.

"You and your intuition!" My friend's voice was edged in scorn. "I
prefer to trust Master's <span class="t23 hoverable">written</span> word."

I shrugged my shoulders and seated myself with quiet finality.
Muttering angrily, Dijen <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> for the door and closed it noisily

behind him.

As the room was rather dark, I moved nearer to the window overlooking
the street. The scant sunlight suddenly increased to an intense
brilliancy in which the iron-barred window completely vanished.
Against this dazzling background appeared the clearly materialized
figure of Sri Yukteswar!

Bewildered to the point of shock, I rose from my chair and knelt
before him. With my customary gesture of respectful greeting at
my guru's feet, I touched his shoes. These were a pair familiar to
me, of orange-dyed canvas, soled with rope. His ocher swami cloth
brushed against me; I distinctly felt not only the texture of his
robe, but <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> the gritty surface of the shoes, and the pressure of
his toes <span class="t5 t7 hoverable">within</span> them. Too <span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">much</span> astounded to utter a word, I stood
up and gazed at him questioningly.

"I was pleased that you got my telepathic message." Master's voice
was calm, entirely normal. "I have now finished my business in
Calcutta, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> arrive in Serampore by the ten o'clock train."

As I still stared mutely, Sri Yukteswar <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> on, "This is not
an apparition, but my flesh and blood form. I have been divinely
commanded to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> you this experience, rare to achieve on earth.
Meet me at the station; you and Dijen will <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> me coming toward you,

dressed as I am now. I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> be preceded by a fellow passenger-a
little boy carrying a silver jug."

My guru placed both hands on my head, with a murmured blessing. As
he concluded with the words, "TABA ASI," {FN19-1} I heard a peculiar
rumbling sound. {FN19-2} His <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> began to melt gradually <span class="t5 t7 hoverable">within</span>
the piercing light. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">First</span> his feet and legs vanished, then his
torso and head, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> a scroll being rolled up. To the very last, I
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> feel his fingers resting lightly on my hair. The effulgence
faded; <span class="t15 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">nothing</span> remained before me but the barred window and a pale
stream of sunlight.

I remained in a half-stupor of confusion, questioning whether I had
not been the victim of a hallucination. A crestfallen Dijen soon
entered the room.

"Master was not on the nine o'clock train, nor <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> the nine-thirty."
My friend <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> his announcement with a slightly apologetic air.

"Come then; I <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">know</span> he will arrive at ten o'clock." I <span class="t4 hoverable">took</span> Dijen's
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t29 hoverable">hand</span> and rushed him forcibly along with me, heedless of his protests.
In about ten minutes we entered the station, where the train was
already puffing to a halt.

"The <span class="t3 t5 t7 t9 t20 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> train is filled with the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> of Master's aura! He is

there!" I exclaimed joyfully.

"You dream so?" Dijen laughed mockingly.

"Let us wait here." I told my friend details of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> in which our
guru <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> approach us. As I finished my description, Sri Yukteswar
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> into view, wearing the same clothes I had seen a short <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span>
earlier. He walked slowly in the wake of a small lad bearing a
silver jug.

For a moment a wave of cold fear passed through me, at the
unprecedented strangeness of my experience. I felt the materialistic,
twentieth-century <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> slipping from me; was I back in the ancient
<span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t11 t20 t26 t27 hoverable">days</span> when <span class="t4 t17 t22 hoverable">Jesus</span> appeared before Peter on the sea?

As Sri Yukteswar, a modern Yogi-Christ, reached the spot where
Dijen and I were speechlessly rooted, <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> smiled at my friend
and remarked:

"I sent you a message too, but you were unable to grasp it."

Dijen was silent, but glared at me suspiciously. After we
had escorted our guru to his hermitage, my friend and I proceeded
toward Serampore College. Dijen halted in the street, indignation
streaming from his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> pore.

"So! <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> sent me a message! <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> you concealed it! I demand an
explanation!"

"Can I help it if your mental mirror oscillates with such restlessness
that you <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">cannot</span> register our guru's instructions?" I retorted.

The anger vanished from Dijen's face. "I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> what you mean," he

WE DO NOT VISIT KASHMIR

"Father, I want to invite <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> and four friends to accompany me
to the Himalayan foothills during my summer vacation. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">May</span> I have
six train passes to Kashmir and enough money to cover our travel
expenses?"

As I had expected, <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t28 hoverable">Father</span> laughed heartily. "This is the third <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span>

similar request last summer, and the year before that? At the last
moment, Sri Yukteswarji refuses to go."

"It is true, Father; I don't <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">know</span> why my guru will not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> me his

already secured the passes from you, somehow I think that this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span>

<span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t28 hoverable">Father</span> was unconvinced at the moment, but the following day, after
some good-humored gibes, he handed me six passes and a roll of
ten-rupee bills.

"I hardly think your theoretical trip needs such practical props,"
he remarked, "but here they are."

That afternoon I exhibited my booty to Sri Yukteswar. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Though</span> he

hermitage disciple, Kanai, to accompany us. I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> invited <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span>
other friends--Rajendra Nath Mitra, Jotin Auddy, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> other boy.
Our date of departure was <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t15 t17 t18 t19 hoverable">set</span> for the following Monday.

On Saturday and Sunday I stayed in Calcutta, where marriage rites
for a cousin were being celebrated at my family home. I arrived in
Serampore with my luggage early Monday morning. Rajendra met me at
the hermitage door.

"Master is out, walking. He has refused to go."

I was equally grieved and obdurate. "I will not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t28 hoverable">Father</span> a third
chance to ridicule my chimerical plans for Kashmir. Come; the rest
of us will go anyhow."

Rajendra agreed; I left the ashram to find a servant. Kanai, I knew,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">take</span> the trip <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> Master, and someone was needed to
look after the luggage. I bethought myself of Behari, previously

a servant in my family home, who was now employed by a Serampore
schoolmaster. As I walked along briskly, I met my guru in front
of the Christian church near Serampore Courthouse.

"Where are you going?" Sri Yukteswar's face was unsmiling.

"Sir, I hear that you and Kanai will not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">take</span> the trip we have been
planning. I am seeking Behari. You will recall that last year he
was so anxious to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> Kashmir that he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> offered to serve <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span>
pay."

"I remember. Nevertheless, I don't think Behari will be willing to
go."

I was exasperated. "He is just eagerly waiting for this opportunity!"

My guru silently resumed his walk; I soon reached the schoolmaster's
house. Behari, in the courtyard, greeted me with a friendly warmth
that abruptly vanished as soon as I mentioned Kashmir. With a murmured
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">word</span> of apology, the servant left me and entered his employer's
house. I waited half an hour, nervously assuring myself that
Behari's delay was being caused by preparations for his trip.
Finally I knocked at the front door.

"Behari left by the back stairs about thirty minutes ago," a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span>

informed me. A slight smile hovered about his lips.

I departed sadly, wondering whether my invitation had been too
coercive or whether Master's unseen influence were at work. Passing
the Christian church, again I saw my guru walking slowly toward
me. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Without</span> waiting to hear my report, he exclaimed:

"So Behari <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> not go! Now, what are your plans?"

I felt <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> a recalcitrant child who is determined to defy his
masterful father. "Sir, I am going to ask my uncle to lend me his
servant, Lal Dhari."

"See your uncle if you want to," Sri Yukteswar replied with a
chuckle. "But I hardly think you will enjoy the visit."

Apprehensive but rebellious, I left my guru and entered Serampore
Courthouse. My paternal uncle, Sarada Ghosh, a government attorney,
welcomed me affectionately.

"I am leaving today with some friends for Kashmir," I told him.
"For <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span> I have been looking forward to this Himalayan trip."

"I am happy for you, Mukunda. Is there anything I can do to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span>
your journey more comfortable?"

These kind <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">words</span> gave me a lift of encouragement. "Dear uncle," I
said, "could you possibly spare me your servant, Lal Dhari?"

My simple request had the effect of an earthquake. Uncle jumped so
violently that his chair overturned, the papers on the desk flew in
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> direction, and his pipe, a long, coconut-stemmed hubble-bubble,
fell to the floor with a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> clatter.

"You selfish young man," he shouted, quivering with wrath, "what a
preposterous idea! Who will look after me, if you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">take</span> my servant
on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of your pleasure jaunts?"

I concealed my surprise, reflecting that my amiable uncle's sudden
change of front was only <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> more enigma in a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> fully devoted
to incomprehensibility. My retreat from the courthouse office was
more alacritous than dignified.

I returned to the hermitage, where my friends were expectantly
gathered. Conviction was growing on me that some sufficient if
exceedingly recondite motive was behind Master's attitude. Remorse
seized me that I had been trying to thwart my guru's will.

"Mukunda, wouldn't you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> to stay awhile longer with me?" Sri
Yukteswar inquired. "Rajendra and the <span class="t1 t7 t13 hoverable">others</span> can go ahead now, and

wait for you at Calcutta. There will be plenty of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> to catch
the last evening train leaving Calcutta for Kashmir."

"Sir, I don't care to go <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> you," I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> mournfully.

My friends paid not the slightest attention to my remark. They
summoned a hackney carriage and departed with all the luggage.
Kanai and I sat quietly at our guru's feet. After a half hour of
complete silence, <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> rose and walked toward the second-floor
dining patio.

"Kanai, please serve Mukunda's food. His train leaves soon."

Getting up from my blanket seat, I staggered suddenly with nausea
and a ghastly churning sensation in my stomach. The stabbing pain
was so intense that I felt I had been abruptly hurled into some
violent hell. Groping blindly toward my guru, I collapsed before
him, attacked by all symptoms of the dread Asiatic cholera. Sri
Yukteswar and Kanai carried me to the sitting room.

Racked with agony, I cried, "Master, I surrender my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> to you;"
for I believed it was indeed fast ebbing from the shores of my
body.

Sri Yukteswar <span class="t0 t2 t16 t18 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">put</span> my head on his lap, stroking my forehead with

angelic tenderness.

"You <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> now what <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have happened if you were at the station
with your friends," he said. "I had to look after you in this strange
way, because you chose to doubt my judgment about taking the trip
at this particular time."

I understood at last. Inasmuch as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> masters seldom <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> fit to
display their powers openly, a casual observer of the day's events
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have imagined that their sequence was quite natural. My guru's
intervention had been too subtle to be suspected. He had worked
his will through Behari and my Uncle Sarada and Rajendra and the
<span class="t1 t7 t13 hoverable">others</span> in such an inconspicuous manner that probably everyone but
myself <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> the situations had been logically normal.

As Sri Yukteswar <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> failed to observe his social obligations,
he instructed Kanai to go for a specialist, and to notify my uncle.

"Master," I protested, "only you can heal me. I am too <span class="t6 t9 t18 t26 hoverable">far</span> gone
for any doctor."

"Child, you are protected by the <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Mercy. Don't worry about
the doctor; he will not find you in this state. You are already
healed."

With my guru's words, the excruciating suffering left me. I sat up
feebly. A doctor soon arrived and examined me carefully.

"You appear to have passed through the worst," he said. "I will
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">take</span> some specimens with me for laboratory tests."

The following morning the physician arrived hurriedly. I was sitting
up, in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> spirits.

"Well, well, here you are, smiling and chatting as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> you had
had no close call with death." He patted my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t29 hoverable">hand</span> gently. "I hardly
expected to find you alive, after I had discovered from the specimens
that your disease was Asiatic cholera. You are fortunate, young
man, to have a guru with <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> healing powers! I am convinced of
it!"

I agreed wholeheartedly. As the doctor was preparing to leave,
Rajendra and Auddy appeared at the door. The resentment in their
faces changed into sympathy as they glanced at the physician and
then at my somewhat wan countenance.

"We were angry when you didn't turn up as agreed at the Calcutta
train. You have been sick?"

"Yes." I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> not help laughing as my friends placed the luggage

in the same corner it had occupied yesterday. I quoted: "There was
a ship that <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> to Spain; when it arrived, it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> back again!"

<span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> entered the room. I permitted myself a convalescent's liberty,
and captured his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t29 hoverable">hand</span> lovingly.

"Guruji," I said, "from my twelfth year on, I have <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span>

that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> your blessings the Goddess Parvati {FN20-2} will not

{FN20-1} Although <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> failed to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> any explanation, his

CHAPTER: 21

WE VISIT KASHMIR

"You are strong enough now to travel. I will accompany you to
Kashmir," Sri Yukteswar informed me <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t11 t20 t26 t27 hoverable">days</span> after my miraculous
recovery from Asiatic cholera.

That evening our party of six entrained for the north. Our <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span>
leisurely stop was at Simla, a queenly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t22 t23 hoverable">city</span> resting on the throne
of Himalayan hills. We strolled over the steep streets, admiring
the magnificent views.

"English strawberries for sale," cried an <span class="t25 hoverable">old</span> woman, squatting in
a picturesque open market place.

<span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> was curious about the strange little red fruits. He bought
a basketful and offered it to Kanai and myself, who were near-by.
I tasted <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> berry but spat it hastily on the ground.

"Sir, what a sour fruit! I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> strawberries!"

My guru laughed. "Oh, you will <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> them-in America. At a dinner
there, your hostess will serve them with sugar and cream. After she
has mashed the berries with a fork, you will taste them and say:
'What delicious strawberries!' Then you will remember this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> in
Simla."

Sri Yukteswar's forecast vanished from my mind, but reappeared
there <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span> later, shortly after my arrival in America. I was
a dinner guest at the home of Mrs. Alice T. Hasey (Sister Yogmata)
in West Somerville, Massachusetts. When a dessert of strawberries
was <span class="t0 t2 t16 t18 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">put</span> on the table, my hostess picked up her fork and mashed my
berries, adding cream and sugar. "The fruit is rather tart; I think
you will <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> it fixed this way," she remarked.

I <span class="t4 hoverable">took</span> a mouthful. "What delicious strawberries!" I exclaimed.
At once my guru's prediction in Simla emerged from the fathomless
cave of memory. It was staggering to realize that <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> ago Sri
Yukteswar's God-tuned <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> had sensitively detected the program of
karmic events wandering in the ether of futurity.

Our party soon left Simla and entrained for Rawalpindi. There
we hired a large landau, drawn by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> horses, in which we started
a seven-day trip to Srinagar, capital <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t22 t23 hoverable">city</span> of Kashmir. The <span class="t6 hoverable">second</span>
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> of our northbound journey <span class="t2 t4 t5 t22 t23 hoverable">brought</span> into view the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> Himalayan
vastness. As the iron wheels of our carriage creaked along the hot,
stony roads, we were enraptured with changing vistas of mountainous
grandeur.

"Sir," Auddy <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to Master, "I am greatly enjoying these glorious
scenes in your <span class="t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t12 t15 t19 t20 t23 t25 hoverable">holy</span> company."

I felt a throb of pleasure at Auddy's appreciation, for I was acting
as host on this trip. Sri Yukteswar caught my thought; he turned
to me and whispered:

"Don't flatter yourself; Auddy is not nearly as entranced with the
scenery as he is with the prospect of leaving us <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> enough to
have a cigaret."

I was shocked. "Sir," I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> in an undertone, "please do not break
our harmony by these unpleasant words. I can hardly believe that
Auddy is hankering for a smoke." {FN21-1} I looked apprehensively
at my usually irrepressible guru.

"Very well; I won't <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">say</span> anything to Auddy." <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> chuckled. "But
you will soon see, when the landau halts, that Auddy is quick to
seize his opportunity."

The carriage arrived at a small caravanserai. As our horses were led
to be watered, Auddy inquired, "Sir, do you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> if I ride awhile
with the driver? I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> to get a little outside air."

Sri Yukteswar gave permission, but remarked to me, "He wants fresh
smoke and not fresh air."

The landau resumed its noisy progress over the dusty roads. Master's

eyes were twinkling; he instructed me, "Crane up your neck through
the carriage door and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> what Auddy is doing with the air."

I obeyed, and was astounded to observe Auddy in the act of exhaling
rings of cigaret smoke. My glance toward Sri Yukteswar was apologetic.

"You are right, as always, sir. Auddy is enjoying a puff along with
a panorama." I surmised that my friend had received a gift from the
cab driver; I knew Auddy had not carried any cigarets from Calcutta.

We continued on the labyrinthine way, adorned by views of rivers,
valleys, precipitous crags, and multitudinous mountain tiers.
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Every</span> night we stopped at rustic inns, and prepared our own food.
Sri Yukteswar <span class="t4 hoverable">took</span> special care of my diet, insisting that I have
lime juice at all meals. I was still weak, but daily improving,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> the rattling carriage was strictly designed for discomfort.

Joyous anticipations filled our hearts as we neared central Kashmir,
paradise <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">land</span> of lotus lakes, floating gardens, gaily canopied
houseboats, the many-bridged Jhelum River, and flower-strewn
pastures, all ringed round by the Himalayan majesty. Our approach
to Srinagar was through an avenue of tall, welcoming trees. We
engaged rooms at a double-storied inn overlooking the noble hills.
No running <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> was available; we drew our supply from a near-by
well. The summer weather was ideal, with warm <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t11 t20 t26 t27 hoverable">days</span> and slightly

cold nights.

We <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> a pilgrimage to the ancient Srinagar temple of Swami
Shankara. As I gazed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the mountain-peak hermitage, standing
bold against the sky, I fell into an ecstatic trance. A vision
appeared of a hilltop mansion in a distant land. The lofty Shankara
ashram before me was transformed into the structure where, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span>
later, I established the Self-Realization Fellowship headquarters
in America. When I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> visited Los Angeles, and saw the large
building on the crest of Mount Washington, I recognized it at once
from my long-past visions in Kashmir and elsewhere.

A few <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t11 t20 t26 t27 hoverable">days</span> at Srinagar; then on to Gulmarg ("mountain paths of
flowers"), elevated by six thousand feet. There I had my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> ride
on a large horse. Rajendra mounted a small trotter, <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whose</span> <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t16 t19 t22 t23 t25 t26 hoverable">heart</span>
was fired with ambition for speed. We ventured onto the very steep
Khilanmarg; the path led through a dense forest, abounding in
tree-mushrooms, where the mist-shrouded trails were often precarious.
But Rajendra's little animal <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> permitted my oversized steed a
moment's rest, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> at the most perilous turns. On, on, untiringly
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> Rajendra's horse, oblivious to all but the joy of competition.

Our strenuous race was rewarded by a breath-taking view. For
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> in this life, I gazed in all directions at sublime
snow-capped Himalayas, lying tier <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> tier <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> silhouettes of

huge polar bears. My eyes feasted exultingly on endless reaches
of icy mountains against sunny blue skies.

I rolled merrily with my young companions, all wearing overcoats,
on the sparkling white slopes. On our downward trip we saw afar a
vast carpet of yellow flowers, wholly transfiguring the bleak hills.

Our next excursions were to the famous royal "pleasure gardens"
of the Emperor Jehangir, at Shalimar and Nishat Bagh. The ancient
palace at Nishat Bagh is built directly over a natural waterfall.
Rushing down from the mountains, the torrent has been regulated
through ingenious contrivances to flow over colorful terraces and
to gush into fountains amidst the dazzling flower-beds. The stream
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> enters several of the palace rooms, ultimately dropping fairy
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> into the lake below. The immense gardens are riotous with
color--roses of a dozen hues, snapdragons, lavender, pansies,
poppies. An emerald enclosing outline is <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> by symmetrical rows
of CHINARS, {FN21-2} cypresses, cherry trees; beyond them tower
the white austerities of the Himalayas.

Kashmir grapes are considered a rare delicacy in Calcutta. Rajendra,
who had been promising himself a veritable feast on reaching Kashmir,
was disappointed to find there no large vineyards. Now and then I
chaffed him jocosely over his baseless anticipation.

"Oh, I have <span class="t8 t13 hoverable">become</span> so <span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">much</span> gorged with grapes I can't walk!" I
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> say. "The invisible grapes are brewing <span class="t5 t7 hoverable">within</span> me!" Later I
heard that sweet grapes grow abundantly in Kabul, west of Kashmir.
We consoled ourselves with ice cream <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> of RABRI, a heavily
condensed milk, and flavored with <span class="t3 t5 t7 t9 t20 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> pistachio nuts.

We <span class="t4 hoverable">took</span> several trips in the SHIKARAS or houseboats, shaded by
red-embroidered canopies, coursing along the intricate channels of
Dal Lake, a network of canals <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> a watery spider web. Here the
numerous floating gardens, crudely improvised with logs and earth,
strike <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> with amazement, so incongruous is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> sight of
vegetables and melons growing in the midst of vast waters. Occasionally
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> sees a peasant, disdaining to be "rooted to the soil," towing
his square plot of "land" to a <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> location in the many-fingered

beauties. The Lady of Kashmir is mountain-crowned, lake-garlanded,
and flower-shod. In later years, after I had toured <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> distant

The ancient majestic redwoods of Yosemite, stretching their huge

After spending happy weeks in Kashmir, I was forced to return to
Bengal for the fall term of Serampore College. Sri Yukteswar remained
in Srinagar, with Kanai and Auddy. Before I departed, <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> hinted
that his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be subject to suffering in Kashmir.

"Sir, you look a picture of health," I protested.

"There is a chance that I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> leave this earth."

"Guruji!" I fell at his feet with an imploring gesture. "Please

Sri Yukteswar was silent, but smiled at me so compassionately that
I felt reassured. Reluctantly I left him.

"Master dangerously ill." This telegram from Auddy reached me
shortly after my return to Serampore.

"Sir," I wired my guru frantically, "I asked for your promise not
to leave me. Please keep your body; otherwise, I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> die."

"Be it as you wish." This was Sri Yukteswar's reply from Kashmir.

A letter from Auddy arrived in a few days, informing me that
<span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> had recovered. On his return to Serampore during the next
fortnight, I was grieved to find my guru's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> reduced to half

Fortunately for his disciples, Sri Yukteswar burned <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> of their

method of physical transfer of disease is <span class="t6 t10 t15 hoverable">known</span> to highly advanced
yogis. A strong <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> can assist a weaker <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> by helping to carry his

Just as a rich <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> loses some money when he pays off a large debt

By a secret method, the yogi unites his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> and astral vehicle

Escaping to the superconsciousness whenever he so desires, a <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">master</span>
can remain oblivious of physical suffering; sometimes he chooses to
bear bodily pain stoically, as an example to disciples. By putting
on the ailments of others, a yogi can satisfy, for them, the karmic

operative; its workings can be scientifically manipulated by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span>

The <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t0 t8 t12 t15 t19 t23 t25 hoverable">law</span> does not require a <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">master</span> to <span class="t8 t13 hoverable">become</span> ill whenever

fell sick and died of the same disease which had stricken his son.

CHAPTER: 22

THE <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t16 t19 t22 t23 t25 t26 hoverable">HEART</span> OF A STONE IMAGE

"As a loyal Hindu wife, I do not wish to complain of my husband. But
I yearn to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> him turn from his materialistic views. He delights
in ridiculing the pictures of saints in my meditation room. Dear
brother, I have deep faith that you can help him. Will you?"

My eldest sister Roma gazed beseechingly at me. I was paying
a short visit at her Calcutta home on Girish Vidyaratna Lane. Her
plea touched me, for she had exercised a profound <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> influence
over my early life, and had lovingly tried to fill the void left

in the family circle by Mother's death.

"Beloved sister, of course I will do anything I can." I smiled,
eager to lift the gloom plainly visible on her face, in contrast
to her usual calm and cheerful expression.

Roma and I sat awhile in silent prayer for guidance. A year earlier,
my sister had asked me to initiate her into KRIYA YOGA, in which
she was making notable progress.

An inspiration seized me. "Tomorrow," I said, "I am going to the
Dakshineswar temple. Please <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> with me, and persuade your husband
to accompany us. I feel that in the vibrations of that <span class="t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t12 t15 t19 t20 t23 t25 hoverable">holy</span> place,
<span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Mother will touch his heart. But don't disclose our object
in wanting him to go."

Sister agreed hopefully. Very early the next morning I was pleased
to find that Roma and her husband were in readiness for the trip.
As our hackney carriage rattled along Upper Circular Road toward
Dakshineswar, my brother-in-law, Satish Chandra Bose, amused himself
by deriding <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> gurus of the past, present, and future. I
noticed that Roma was quietly weeping.

"Sister, cheer up!" I whispered. "Don't <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> your husband the

"Mukunda, how can you admire worthless humbugs?" Satish was saying.
"A SADHU'S very appearance is repulsive. He is either as thin as
a skeleton, or as unholily fat as an elephant!"

I shouted with laughter. My good-natured reaction was annoying
to Satish; he retired into sullen silence. As our cab entered the
Dakshineswar grounds, he grinned sarcastically.

"This excursion, I suppose, is a scheme to reform me?"

As I turned <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">away</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> reply, he caught my arm. "Young Mr. Monk,"
he said, "don't forget to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> proper arrangements with the temple
authorities to provide for our noon meal."

"I am going to meditate now. Do not worry about your lunch," I
replied sharply. "Divine Mother will look after it."

"I don't trust <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Mother to do a single thing for me. But I do
hold you responsible for my food." Satish's tones were threatening.

I proceeded alone to the colonnaded hall which fronts the large
temple of Kali, or Mother Nature. Selecting a shady spot near <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span>
of the pillars, I arranged my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> in the lotus posture. Although
it was only about seven o'clock, the morning <span class="t0 t8 t11 t14 t23 t25 t28 hoverable">sun</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> soon be

The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> receded as I became devotionally entranced. My <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> was
concentrated on Goddess Kali, <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whose</span> image at Dakshineswar had been
the special object of adoration by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> master, Sri Ramakrishna
Paramhansa. In answer to his anguished demands, the stone image of
this very temple had often <span class="t19 hoverable">taken</span> a living <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> and conversed with
him.

"Silent Mother with stony heart," I prayed, "Thou becamest filled
with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> at the request of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thy</span> beloved devotee Ramakrishna; why

My aspiring zeal increased boundlessly, accompanied by a <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span>
peace. Yet, when five hours had passed, and the Goddess whom
I was inwardly visualizing had <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> no response, I felt slightly
disheartened. Sometimes it is a test by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> to delay the fulfillment

of prayers. But He eventually appears to the persistent devotee
in whatever <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> he holds dear. A devout Christian sees Jesus; a
Hindu beholds Krishna, or the Goddess Kali, or an expanding <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Light</span>
if his worship takes an impersonal turn.

Reluctantly I opened my eyes, and saw that the temple doors were
being locked by a priest, in conformance with a noon-hour custom.
I rose from my secluded seat under the open, roofed hall, and stepped
into the courtyard. Its stone floor was scorching under the midday
sun; my bare feet were painfully burned.

"Divine Mother," I silently remonstrated, "Thou didst not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> to
me in vision, and now <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thou</span> art hidden in the temple behind closed
doors. I wanted to offer a special prayer to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thee</span> today on behalf
of my brother-in-law."

My inward petition was instantly acknowledged. First, a delightful
cold wave descended over my back and under my feet, banishing
all discomfort. Then, to my amazement, the temple became greatly
magnified. Its large door slowly opened, revealing the stone figure
of Goddess Kali. Gradually it changed into a living form, smilingly
nodding in greeting, thrilling me with joy indescribable. As if by
a mystic syringe, the breath was withdrawn from my lungs; my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span>
became very still, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> not inert.

An ecstatic enlargement of consciousness followed. I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span>
clearly for several miles over the Ganges River to my left, and
beyond the temple into the entire Dakshineswar precincts. The walls
of all buildings glimmered transparently; through them I observed
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> walking to and fro over distant acres.

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Though</span> I was breathless and my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> in a strangely quiet state, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span>
I was able to move my hands and feet freely. For several minutes
I experimented in closing and opening my eyes; in either state I
saw distinctly the <span class="t3 t5 t7 t9 t20 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> Dakshineswar panorama.

<span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">Spiritual</span> sight, x-raylike, penetrates into all matter; the <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span>
eye is center everywhere, circumference nowhere. I realized anew,
standing there in the sunny courtyard, that when <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> ceases to be a
prodigal child of God, engrossed in a physical <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> indeed dream,
baseless as a bubble, he reinherits his eternal realms. If "escapism"
be a need of man, cramped in his narrow personality, can any escape
compare with the majesty of omnipresence?

In my sacred experience at Dakshineswar, the only extraordinarily-enlarged
objects were the temple and the <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of the Goddess. Everything
else appeared in its normal dimensions, although each was enclosed
in a halo of mellow light-white, blue, and pastel rainbow hues. My
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> seemed to be of ethereal substance, ready to levitate. Fully
conscious of my material surroundings, I was looking about me and

taking a few steps <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> disturbing the continuity of the blissful
vision.

Behind the temple walls I suddenly glimpsed my brother-in-law
as he sat under the thorny branches of a sacred BEL tree. I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span>
effortlessly discern the course of his thoughts. Somewhat uplifted
under the <span class="t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t12 t15 t19 t20 t23 t25 hoverable">holy</span> influence of Dakshineswar, his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> held unkind
reflections about me. I turned directly to the gracious <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of
the Goddess.

"Divine Mother," I prayed, "wilt <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thou</span> not spiritually change my
sister's husband?"

The beautiful figure, hitherto silent, spoke at last: "Thy wish is
granted!"

I looked happily at Satish. As <span class="t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> instinctively aware that some
<span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> was at work, he rose resentfully from his seat on
the ground. I saw him running behind the temple; he approached me,
shaking his fist.

The all-embracing vision disappeared. No longer <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> the
glorious Goddess; the towering temple was reduced to its ordinary
size, minus its transparency. Again my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> sweltered under the

fierce rays of the sun. I jumped to the shelter of the pillared
hall, where Satish pursued me angrily. I looked at my watch. It
was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> o'clock; the <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> vision had lasted an hour.

"You little fool," my brother-in-law blurted out, "you have been
sitting there cross-legged and cross-eyed for six hours. I have
gone back and <span class="t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t9 t10 t11 t13 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">forth</span> watching you. Where is my food? Now the temple
is closed; you failed to notify the authorities; we are left <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span>
lunch!"

The exaltation I had felt at the Goddess' presence was still vibrant
<span class="t5 t7 hoverable">within</span> my heart. I was emboldened to exclaim, "Divine Mother will
feed us!"

Satish was beside himself with rage. "Once and for all," he shouted,
"I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> your <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Mother giving us food here <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span>
prior arrangements!"

His <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">words</span> were hardly uttered when a temple priest crossed the
courtyard and joined us.

"Son," he addressed me, "I have been observing your face serenely
glowing during hours of meditation. I saw the arrival of your party
this morning, and felt a desire to <span class="t0 t2 t16 t18 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">put</span> aside ample food for your
lunch. It is against the temple rules to feed those who do not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span>

a request beforehand, but I have <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> an exception for you."

I thanked him, and gazed straight into Satish's eyes. He flushed
with emotion, lowering his gaze in silent repentance. When we were
served a lavish meal, including out-of-season mangoes, I noticed
that my brother-in-law's appetite was meager. He was bewildered,
diving deep into the ocean of thought. On the return journey to
Calcutta, Satish, with softened expression, occasionally glanced at
me pleadingly. But he did not speak a single <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">word</span> after the moment
the priest had appeared to invite us to lunch, as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> in direct
answer to Satish's challenge.

The following afternoon I visited my sister at her home. She greeted
me affectionately.

"Dear brother," she cried, "what a miracle! Last evening my husband
wept openly before me.

"'Beloved DEVI,' {FN22-1} he said, 'I am happy beyond expression
that this reforming scheme of your brother's has wrought a
transformation. I am going to undo <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> wrong I have done you. From

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">Years</span> later, I visited my brother-in-law in Delhi. I was overjoyed
to perceive that he had developed highly in self-realization, and
had been blessed by the vision of <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Mother. During my stay
with him, I noticed that Satish secretly spent the greater <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span>

"Dear brother," she said, "I am well, and my husband is sick.
Nevertheless, I want you to <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">know</span> that, as a devoted Hindu wife, I

<span class="t19 hoverable">Taken</span> aback at her ominous words, I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> realized their sting of
truth. I was in America when my sister died, about a year after
her prediction. My youngest brother Bishnu later gave me the details.

"Roma and Satish were in Calcutta at the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of her death," Bishnu
told me. "That morning she dressed herself in her bridal finery.

"'Why this special costume?' Satish inquired.

"'This is my last <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> of service to you on earth,' Roma replied.

out for aid, she said:

"'Son, do not leave me. It is no use; I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> be gone before a

"Satish became very reclusive after his wife's death," Bishnu
continued. "One <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> he and I were looking at a large smiling

"'Why do you smile?' Satish suddenly exclaimed, as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> his wife

"Although at this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> Satish had fully recovered from his sickness,

CHAPTER: 23

I RECEIVE MY UNIVERSITY DEGREE

"You ignore your textbook assignments in philosophy. No doubt you
are depending on an unlaborious 'intuition' to get you through the
examinations. But unless you apply yourself in a more scholarly
manner, I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> to it that you don't <span class="t5 hoverable">pass</span> this course."

Professor D. C. Ghoshal of Serampore College was addressing me
sternly. If I failed to <span class="t5 hoverable">pass</span> his final <span class="t23 hoverable">written</span> classroom test, I
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be ineligible to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">take</span> the conclusive examinations. These are
formulated by the faculty of Calcutta University, which numbers

Serampore College <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span> its affiliated branches. A student in Indian
universities who is unsuccessful in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> subject in the A.B. finals
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> be examined anew in ALL his subjects the following year.

My instructors at Serampore College usually treated me with kindness,
not untinged by an amused tolerance. "Mukunda is a bit over-drunk
with religion." <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> summing me up, they tactfully spared me the
embarrassment of answering classroom questions; they trusted the
final <span class="t23 hoverable">written</span> tests to eliminate me from the list of A.B. candidates.
The judgment passed by my fellow students was expressed in their
nickname for me-"Mad Monk."

I <span class="t4 hoverable">took</span> an ingenious step to nullify Professor Ghoshal's threat to
me of failure in philosophy. When the results of the final tests
were about to be publicly announced, I asked a classmate to accompany
me to the professor's study.

"Come along; I want a witness," I told my companion. "I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> be
very <span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">much</span> disappointed if I have not succeeded in outwitting the
instructor."

Professor Ghoshal shook his head after I had inquired what rating
he had <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> my paper.

"You are not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span> those who have passed," he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> in triumph. He

hunted through a large pile on his desk. "Your paper isn't here at
all; you have failed, in any case, through non-appearance at the
examination."

I chuckled. "Sir, I was there. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">May</span> I look through the stack myself?"

The professor, nonplused, gave his permission; I quickly <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> my
paper, where I had carefully omitted any identification mark except
my roll call number. Unwarned by the "red flag" of my name, the
instructor had <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> a high rating to my answers <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> they
were unembellished by textbook quotations. {FN23-1}

Seeing through my trick, he now thundered, "Sheer brazen luck!" He
added hopefully, "You are sure to fail in the A.B. finals."

For the tests in my other subjects, I received some coaching,
particularly from my dear friend and cousin, Prabhas Chandra
Ghose, {FN23-2} <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> of my Uncle Sarada. I staggered painfully but
successfully-with the lowest possible passing marks-through all my
final tests.

Now, after four <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span> of college, I was eligible to sit for the
A.B. examinations. Nevertheless, I hardly expected to avail myself
of the privilege. The Serampore College finals were child's play
compared to the stiff ones which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t15 t17 t18 t19 hoverable">set</span> by Calcutta University

for the A.B. degree. My almost daily visits to Sri Yukteswar had
left me little <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> to enter the college halls. There it was my
presence rather than my absence that <span class="t2 t4 t5 t22 t23 hoverable">brought</span> <span class="t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t9 t10 t11 t13 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">forth</span> ejaculations of
amazement from my classmates!

My customary routine was to <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t15 t17 t18 t19 hoverable">set</span> out on my bicycle about nine-thirty
in the morning. In <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t29 hoverable">hand</span> I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> carry an offering for my guru-a
few flowers from the garden of my PANTHI boardinghouse. Greeting
me affably, <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> invite me to lunch. I invariably accepted
with alacrity, glad to banish the <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> of college for the day.
After hours with Sri Yukteswar, listening to his incomparable flow of
wisdom, or helping with ashram duties, I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> reluctantly depart
around midnight for the PANTHI. Occasionally I stayed all night with
my guru, so happily engrossed in his conversation that I scarcely
noticed when darkness changed into dawn.

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">One</span> night about eleven o'clock, as I was putting on my shoes
{FN23-3} in preparation for the ride to the boardinghouse, <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span>
questioned me gravely.

"When do your A.B. examinations start?"

"Five <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t11 t20 t26 t27 hoverable">days</span> hence, sir."

"I hope you are in readiness for them."

Transfixed with alarm, I held <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> shoe in the air. "Sir," I
protested, "you <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">know</span> how my <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t11 t20 t26 t27 hoverable">days</span> have been passed with you rather
than with the professors. How can I enact a farce by appearing for
those difficult finals?"

Sri Yukteswar's eyes were turned piercingly on mine. "You <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span>
appear." His tone was coldly peremptory. "We should not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> <span class="t1 t3 t9 t15 t20 t21 t26 t29 hoverable">cause</span>
for your <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t28 hoverable">father</span> and other relatives to criticize your preference
for ashram life. Just promise me that you will be present for the
examinations; answer them the best <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> you can."

Uncontrollable tears were coursing down my face. I felt that
Master's command was unreasonable, and that his interest was, to
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">say</span> the least, belated.

"I will appear if you wish it," I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> amidst sobs. "But no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span>
remains for proper preparation." Under my breath I muttered, "I will
fill up the sheets with your teachings in answer to the questions!"

When I entered the hermitage the following <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> at my usual hour,
I presented my bouquet with a <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> mournful solemnity. Sri
Yukteswar laughed at my woebegone air.

"Mukunda, has the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> <span class="t29 hoverable">ever</span> failed you, at an examination or

elsewhere?"

"No, sir," I responded warmly. Grateful memories <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> in a revivifying

"Not laziness but burning zeal for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> has prevented you from

quoted, "'Seek ye <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> the kingdom of God, and His righteousness;

For the thousandth time, I felt my burdens lifted in Master's
presence. When we had finished our early lunch, he suggested that
I return to the PANTHI.

"Does your friend, Romesh Chandra Dutt, still live in your
boardinghouse?"

"Yes, sir."

"Get in touch with him; the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> will inspire him to help you with
the examinations."

"Very well, sir; but Romesh is unusually busy. He is the honor <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span>
in our class, and carries a heavier course than the others."

Master waved aside my objections. "Romesh will find <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> for you.
Now go."

I bicycled back to the PANTHI. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> <span class="t9 hoverable">person</span> I met in the
boardinghouse compound was the scholarly Romesh. As <span class="t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> his <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t11 t20 t26 t27 hoverable">days</span>
were quite free, he obligingly agreed to my diffident request.

"Of course; I am at your service." He spent several hours of that
afternoon and of succeeding <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t11 t20 t26 t27 hoverable">days</span> in coaching me in my various
subjects.

"I believe <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> questions in English literature will be centered
in the route of Childe Harold," he told me. "We <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> get an atlas
at once."

I hastened to the home of my Uncle Sarada and borrowed an atlas.
Romesh marked the European map at the places visited by Byron's
romantic traveler.

A few classmates had gathered around to listen to the tutoring.
"Romesh is advising you wrongly," <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of them commented to me at
the <span class="t7 t10 t15 t25 hoverable">end</span> of a session. "Usually only fifty per cent of the questions
are about the books; the other half will involve the authors'
lives."

When I sat for the examination in English literature the following
day, my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> glance at the questions caused tears of gratitude
to pour forth, wetting my paper. The classroom monitor <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> to my
desk and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> a sympathetic inquiry.

"My guru foretold that Romesh <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> help me," I explained. "Look;
the very questions dictated to me by Romesh are here on the examination
sheet! Fortunately for me, there are very few questions this year
on English authors, <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whose</span> lives are wrapped in deep mystery so <span class="t6 t9 t18 t26 hoverable">far</span>
as I am concerned!"

My boardinghouse was in an uproar when I returned. The boys who
had been ridiculing Romesh's method of coaching looked at me in
awe, almost deafening me with congratulations. During the week of
the examinations, I spent <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> hours with Romesh, who formulated
questions that he <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> were likely to be <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t15 t17 t18 t19 hoverable">set</span> by the professors.
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Day</span> by day, Romesh's questions appeared in almost the same <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> on
the examination sheets.

The news was widely circulated in the college that something resembling
a miracle was occurring, and that success seemed probable for the
absent-minded "Mad Monk." I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> no attempt to hide the facts of the
case. The local professors were powerless to alter the questions,
which had been arranged by Calcutta University.

Thinking over the examination in English literature, I realized
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> morning that I had <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> a serious error. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">One</span> section of the
questions had been divided into <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> parts of A or B, and C or D.
Instead of answering <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> question from each part, I had carelessly
answered both questions in Group I, and had failed to consider
anything in Group II. The best mark I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> score in that paper
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be 33, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> less than the passing mark of 36. I rushed to
<span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> and poured out my troubles.

"Sir, I have <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> an unpardonable blunder. I don't deserve the
<span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> blessings through Romesh; I am quite unworthy."

"Cheer up, Mukunda." Sri Yukteswar's tones were <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> and unconcerned.
He pointed to the blue vault of the heavens. "It is more possible
for the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t14 t23 t25 t28 hoverable">sun</span> and moon to interchange their positions in space than
it is for you to fail in getting your degree!"

I left the hermitage in a more tranquil mood, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> it seemed
mathematically inconceivable that I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> pass. I looked once or
twice apprehensively into the sky; the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Day</span> appeared to be
securely anchored in his customary orbit!

As I reached the PANTHI, I overheard a classmate's remark: "I
have just learned that this year, for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> time, the required
passing mark in English literature has been lowered."

I entered the boy's room with such speed that he looked up in alarm.
I questioned him eagerly.

"Long-haired monk," he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> laughingly, "why this sudden interest
in scholastic matters? Why cry in the eleventh hour? But it is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span>
that the passing mark has just been lowered to 33 points."

A few joyous leaps <span class="t4 hoverable">took</span> me into my own room, where I sank to my
knees and praised the mathematical perfections of my <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Father.

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Every</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> I thrilled with the consciousness of a <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> presence
that I clearly felt to be guiding me through Romesh. A significant
incident occurred in connection with the examination in Bengali.
Romesh, who had touched little on that subject, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> me back
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> morning as I was leaving the boardinghouse on my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> to the
examination hall.

"There is Romesh shouting for you," a classmate <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to me impatiently.
"Don't return; we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> be late at the hall."

Ignoring the advice, I ran back to the house.

"The Bengali examination is usually easily passed by our Bengali
boys," Romesh told me. "But I have just had a hunch that this

year the professors have planned to massacre the students by asking
questions from our ancient literature." My friend then briefly outlined
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> stories from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of Vidyasagar, a renowned philanthropist.

I thanked Romesh and quickly bicycled to the college hall.
The examination sheet in Bengali proved to contain <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> parts. The
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> instruction was: "Write <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> instances of the charities of
Vidyasagar." As I transferred to the paper the lore that I had so
recently acquired, I whispered a few <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">words</span> of thanksgiving that
I had heeded Romesh's last-minute summons. Had I been ignorant of
Vidyasagar's benefactions to mankind (including ultimately myself),
I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> not have passed the Bengali examination. Failing in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span>
subject, I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have been forced to stand examination anew in all
subjects the following year. Such a prospect was understandably
abhorrent.

The <span class="t6 hoverable">second</span> instruction on the sheet read: "Write an essay in Bengali
on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> who has most inspired you." Gentle reader,
I need not inform you what <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> I chose for my theme. As I covered
page after page with praise of my guru, I smiled to realize that
my muttered prediction was coming true: "I will fill up the sheets
with your teachings!"

I had not felt inclined to question Romesh about my course in
philosophy. Trusting my <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> training under Sri Yukteswar, I safely

disregarded the textbook explanations. The <span class="t6 t9 t22 t29 hoverable">highest</span> mark <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> to

subjects was just barely <span class="t5 t7 hoverable">within</span> the passing mark.

It is a pleasure to record that my unselfish friend Romesh received
his own degree CUM LAUDE.

<span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t28 hoverable">Father</span> was wreathed in smiles at my graduation. "I hardly <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span>

refused this same request. Today, however, he smiled graciously.

"Very well; tomorrow I will initiate you into swamiship." He <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span>
on quietly, "I am happy that you have persisted in your desire to

It
was a sunny Thursday, I remember, in July, 1914, a few weeks after
my graduation from college. On the inner balcony of his Serampore
hermitage, <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> dipped a <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> piece of white silk into a dye of
ocher, the traditional color of the Swami Order. After the cloth
had dried, my guru draped it around me as a renunciate's robe.

"Someday you will go to the West, where silk is preferred," he said.
"As a symbol, I have chosen for you this silk material instead of
the customary cotton."

In India, where monks embrace the ideal of poverty, a silk-clad
swami is an unusual sight. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Many</span> yogis, however, wear garments of
silk, which preserves <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> subtle bodily currents better than
cotton.

"I am averse to ceremonies," Sri Yukteswar remarked. "I will <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span>

you a swami in the BIDWAT (non-ceremonious) manner."

The BIBIDISA or elaborate initiation into swamiship includes a <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span>
ceremony, during which symbolical funeral rites are performed. The
physical <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> of the disciple is represented as dead, cremated in
the flame of wisdom. The newly-made swami is then <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> a chant,
such as: "This ATMA is Brahma" {FN24-2} or "Thou art That" or "I am
He." Sri Yukteswar, however, with his <span class="t7 hoverable">love</span> of simplicity, dispensed
with all formal rites and merely asked me to select a <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> name.

"I will <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> you the privilege of choosing it yourself," he said,
smiling.

"Yogananda," I replied, after a moment's thought. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> literally

"Be it so. Forsaking your family <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> of Mukunda Lal Ghosh,

The ideal of selfless service to all mankind, and of renunciation

engage actively in humanitarian and educational <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t7 t10 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> in India, or

creed, class, color, sex, or race, a swami follows the precepts of

his waking and sleeping consciousness with the thought, "I am He,"
he roams contentedly, in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> but not of it. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> only <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span>
he justify his title of swami-one who seeks to achieve union with
the SWA or Self. It is needless to add that not all formally titled
swamis are equally successful in reaching their high goal.

Sri Yukteswar was both a swami and a yogi. A swami, formally a monk

The ancient rishi Patanjali defines "yoga" as "control of the
fluctuations of the mind-stuff." {FN24-4} His very short and masterly
expositions, the YOGA SUTRAS, <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of the six systems of Hindu
philosophy. {FN24-5} In contradistinction to Western philosophies,
all six Hindu systems embody not only theoretical but practical
teachings. In addition to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> conceivable ontological inquiry,
the six systems formulate six definite disciplines aimed at the
permanent removal of suffering and the attainment of timeless bliss.

The common thread linking all six systems is the declaration that
no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> freedom for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> is possible <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of the ultimate

and cognizes in experience the veritable Essence.

The YOGA system as outlined by Patanjali is <span class="t6 t10 t15 hoverable">known</span> as the Eightfold

Path. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> steps, (1) YAMA and (2) NIYAMA, require observance
of ten negative and positive moralities-avoidance of injury to others,
of untruthfulness, of stealing, of incontinence, of gift-receiving
(which brings obligations); and purity of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> and mind, contentment,
self-discipline, study, and devotion to God.

The next steps are (3) ASANA (right posture); the spinal column

and (5) PRATYAHARA (withdrawal of the senses from external objects).

The last steps are forms of yoga proper: (6) DHARANA (concentration);
holding the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> thought; (7) DHYANA (meditation), and (8)
SAMADHI (superconscious perception). This is the Eightfold Path
of Yoga {FN24-6} which leads <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> to the final goal of KAIVALYA

paths disappear. The BHAGAVAD GITA, however, points out that the
methods of yoga are all-embracive. Its techniques are not meant only
for <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> types and temperaments, such as those few who incline
toward the monastic life; yoga requires no formal allegiance.
Because the yogic science satisfies a universal need, it has a

"When a religious method recommends itself as 'scientific,' it can
be <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> of its public in the West. Yoga fulfills this expectation,"
Dr. Jung writes. {FN24-7} "Quite apart from the charm of the new,
and the fascination of the half-understood, there is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> <span class="t1 t3 t9 t15 t20 t21 t26 t29 hoverable">cause</span>

hygiene which is superior to ordinary gymnastics and breathing

it unites them with the <span class="t3 t5 t7 t9 t20 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> of the spirit, as is quite clear,
for instance, in the PRANAYAMA exercises where PRANA is both the
breath and the universal dynamics of the cosmos.

"When the thing which the individual is doing is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> a cosmic event,

the emotion of the <span class="t0 t1 t3 t5 t7 t8 t13 t16 t18 t20 t21 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> (the universal idea), and out of this there
develops a lively unity which no technique, <span class="t27 t28 hoverable">however</span> scientific, can
produce.

without the concepts on which Yoga is based. It combines the bodily
and the <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> with each other in an extraordinarily complete
way.

"In the East, where these ideas and practices have developed, and
where for several thousand <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span> an unbroken tradition has created
the necessary <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> foundations, Yoga is, as I can readily
believe, the perfect and appropriate method of fusing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> and

CHAPTER: 25

BROTHER ANANTA AND SISTER NALINI

"Ananta <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">cannot</span> live; the sands of his karma for this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> have run

These inexorable <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">words</span> reached my inner consciousness as I sat <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span>
morning in deep meditation. Shortly after I had entered the Swami
Order, I paid a visit to my birthplace, Gorakhpur, as a guest of
my elder brother Ananta. A sudden illness confined him to his bed;
I nursed him lovingly.

The solemn inward pronouncement filled me with grief. I felt that
I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> not bear to remain longer in Gorakhpur, only to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> my
brother removed before my helpless gaze. Amidst uncomprehending
criticism from my relatives, I left India on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> available
boat. It cruised along Burma and the China Sea to Japan. I disembarked
at Kobe, where I spent only a few days. My <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t16 t19 t22 t23 t25 t26 hoverable">heart</span> was too heavy for
sightseeing.

On the return trip to India, the boat touched at Shanghai. There
Dr. Misra, the ship's physician, guided me to several curio shops,
where I selected various presents for Sri Yukteswar and my family
and friends. For Ananta I purchased a large carved bamboo piece.
No sooner had the Chinese salesman handed me the bamboo souvenir
than I dropped it on the floor, crying out, "I have bought this
for my dear dead brother!"

A clear realization had swept over me that his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> was just being
freed in the Infinite. The souvenir was sharply and symbolically
cracked by its fall; amidst sobs, I wrote on the bamboo surface:
"For my beloved Ananta, now gone."

My companion, the doctor, was observing these proceedings with a
sardonic smile.

"Save your tears," he remarked. "Why shed them until you are sure
he is dead?"

When our boat reached Calcutta, Dr. Misra again accompanied me. My
youngest brother Bishnu was waiting to greet me at the dock.

"I <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">know</span> Ananta has departed this life," I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to Bishnu, before he
had had <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> to speak. "Please tell me, and the doctor here, when
Ananta died."

Bishnu named the date, which was the very <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> that I had bought
the souvenirs in Shanghai.

"Look here!" Dr. Misra ejaculated. "Don't <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">let</span> any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">word</span> of this
get around! The professors will be adding a year's study of mental
telepathy to the medical course, which is already <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> enough!"

<span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t28 hoverable">Father</span> embraced me warmly as I entered our Gurpar Road home. "You
have come," he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> tenderly. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Two</span> large tears dropped from his
eyes. Ordinarily undemonstrative, he had <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> before shown me
these signs of affection. Outwardly the grave father, inwardly he
possessed the melting <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t16 t19 t22 t23 t25 t26 hoverable">heart</span> of a mother. In all his dealings with
the family, his dual parental role was distinctly manifest.

Soon after Ananta's passing, my younger sister Nalini was <span class="t2 t4 t5 t22 t23 hoverable">brought</span>
back from death's door by a <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> healing. Before relating the
story, I will refer to a few phases of her earlier life.

The childhood relationship between Nalini and myself had not been
of the happiest nature. I was very thin; she was thinner still.
Through an unconscious motive or "complex" which psychiatrists will
have no difficulty in identifying, I often <span class="t27 hoverable">used</span> to tease my sister
about her cadaverous appearance. Her retorts were equally permeated
with the callous frankness of extreme youth. Sometimes Mother

intervened, ending the childish quarrels, temporarily, by a gentle
box on my ear, as the elder ear.

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Time</span> passed; Nalini was betrothed to a young Calcutta physician,
Panchanon Bose. He received a generous dowry from Father, presumably
(as I remarked to Sister) to compensate the bridegroom-to-be for
his fate in allying himself with a <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> bean-pole.

Elaborate marriage rites were celebrated in due time. On the wedding
night, I joined the large and jovial group of relatives in the
living room of our Calcutta home. The bridegroom was leaning on an
immense gold-brocaded pillow, with Nalini at his side. A gorgeous
purple silk SARI {FN25-1} <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> not, alas, wholly hide her angularity.
I sheltered myself behind the pillow of my <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> brother-in-law and
grinned at him in friendly fashion. He had <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> seen Nalini until
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> of the nuptial ceremony, when he finally learned what he
was getting in the matrimonial lottery.

Feeling my sympathy, Dr. Bose pointed unobtrusively to Nalini, and
whispered in my ear, "Say, what's this?"

"Why, Doctor," I replied, "it is a skeleton for your observation!"

Convulsed with mirth, my brother-in-law and I were hard <span class="t0 t2 t16 t18 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">put</span> to it
to maintain the proper decorum before our assembled relatives.

As the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span> <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> on, Dr. Bose endeared himself to our family, who
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> on him whenever illness arose. He and I became fast friends,
often joking together, usually with Nalini as our target.

"It is a medical curiosity," my brother-in-law remarked to me <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span>
day. "I have tried everything on your lean sister-cod liver oil,
butter, malt, honey, fish, meat, eggs, tonics. Still she fails to
bulge <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> one-hundredth of an inch." We both chuckled.

A few <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t11 t20 t26 t27 hoverable">days</span> later I visited the Bose home. My errand there <span class="t4 hoverable">took</span> only
a few minutes; I was leaving, unnoticed, I thought, by Nalini. As
I reached the front door, I heard her voice, cordial but commanding.

"Brother, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> here. You are not going to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> me the slip this
time. I want to talk to you."

I mounted the stairs to her room. To my surprise, she was in tears.

"Dear brother," she said, "let us bury the <span class="t25 hoverable">old</span> hatchet. I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> that
your feet are now firmly <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t15 t17 t18 t19 hoverable">set</span> on the <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> path. I want to <span class="t8 t13 hoverable">become</span>

She added hopefully, "You are now robust
in appearance; can you help me? My husband does not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> near me,
and I <span class="t7 hoverable">love</span> him so dearly! But still more I want to progress in
God-realization, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> if I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> remain thin {FN25-2} and unattractive."

My <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t16 t19 t22 t23 t25 t26 hoverable">heart</span> was deeply touched at her plea. Our <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> friendship steadily
progressed; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> she asked to <span class="t8 t13 hoverable">become</span> my disciple.

"Train me in any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> you like. I <span class="t0 t2 t16 t18 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">put</span> my trust in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> instead of
tonics." She gathered <span class="t16 t21 hoverable">together</span> an armful of medicines and poured
them down the roof drain.

As a test of her faith, I asked her to omit from her diet all fish,
meat, and eggs.

After several months, during which Nalini had strictly followed
the various rules I had outlined, and had adhered to her vegetarian
diet in spite of numerous difficulties, I paid her a visit.

"Sis, you have been conscientiously observing the <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span>
injunctions; your reward is near." I smiled mischievously. "How
plump do you want to be-as fat as our aunt who hasn't seen her feet
in years?"

"No! But I <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> to be as stout as you are."

I replied solemnly. "By the grace of God, as I have spoken <span class="t3 t7 t9 t10 t15 t19 t22 hoverable">truth</span>
always, I speak truly now. {FN25-3} Through the <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> blessings,

have the same weight as mine."

These <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">words</span> from my <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t16 t19 t22 t23 t25 t26 hoverable">heart</span> <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> fulfillment. In thirty days, Nalini's
weight equalled mine. The <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> roundness gave her beauty; her husband
fell deeply in love. Their marriage, begun so inauspiciously, turned
out to be ideally happy.

On my return from Japan, I learned that during my absence Nalini
had been stricken with typhoid fever. I rushed to her home, and was
aghast to find her reduced to a mere skeleton. She was in a coma.

"Before her <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> became confused by illness," my brother-in-law
told me, "she often said: 'If brother Mukunda were here, I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span>
not be faring thus.'" He added despairingly, "The other doctors
and myself <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> no hope. Blood dysentery has <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t15 t17 t18 t19 hoverable">set</span> in, after her <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span>
bout with typhoid."

I began to move <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t15 t18 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heaven</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> with my prayers. Engaging
an Anglo-Indian nurse, who gave me full cooperation, I applied to
my sister various yoga techniques of healing. The blood dysentery
disappeared.

But Dr. Bose shook his head mournfully. "She simply has no more
blood left to shed."

"She will recover," I replied stoutly. "In seven <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t11 t20 t26 t27 hoverable">days</span> her fever
will be gone."

A week later I was thrilled to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> Nalini open her eyes and gaze at
me with loving recognition. From that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> her recovery was swift.
Although she regained her usual weight, she bore <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> sad scar of her
nearly fatal illness: her legs were paralyzed. Indian and English
specialists pronounced her a hopeless cripple.

The incessant war for her <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> which I had waged by prayer had
exhausted me. I <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> to Serampore to ask Sri Yukteswar's help. His
eyes expressed deep sympathy as I told him of Nalini's plight.

"Your sister's legs will be normal at the <span class="t7 t10 t15 t25 hoverable">end</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> month." He
added, "Let her wear, next to her skin, a band with an unperforated
two-carat pearl, held on by a clasp."

I prostrated myself at his feet with joyful relief.

"Sir, you are a master; your <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">word</span> of her recovery is enough But if
you insist I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> immediately get her a pearl."

My guru nodded. "Yes, do that." He <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> on to correctly describe
the physical and mental characteristics of Nalini, whom he had
<span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> seen.

"Sir," I inquired, "is this an astrological analysis? You do not
<span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">know</span> her birth <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> or hour."

Sri Yukteswar smiled. "There is a deeper astrology, not dependent
on the testimony of calendars and clocks. Each <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> is a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of

penetrates more profoundly, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> to the universal pattern of which

I returned to Calcutta and purchased a pearl for Nalini. A month
later, her paralyzed legs were completely healed.

Sister asked me to convey her heartfelt gratitude to my guru. He
listened to her message in silence. But as I was taking my leave,
he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> a pregnant comment.

CHAPTER: 26

THE SCIENCE OF KRIYA YOGA

The science of KRIYA YOGA, mentioned so often in these pages, became
widely <span class="t6 t10 t15 hoverable">known</span> in modern India through the instrumentality of Lahiri
Mahasaya, my guru's guru. The Sanskrit root of KRIYA is KRI, to
do, to act and react; the same root is <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">word</span> KARMA, the
natural principle of <span class="t1 t3 t9 t15 t20 t21 t26 t29 hoverable">cause</span> and effect. KRIYA YOGA is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> "union

(yoga) with the Infinite through a <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> action or rite." A yogi
who faithfully follows its technique is gradually freed from karma
or the universal chain of causation.

Because of <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> ancient yogic injunctions, I <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">cannot</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> a full
explanation of KRIYA YOGA in the pages of a <span class="t25 hoverable">book</span> intended for the
general public. The actual technique <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> be learned from a KRIYABAN
or KRIYA YOGI; here a broad reference <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> suffice.

KRIYA YOGA is a simple, psychophysiological method by which the
<span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> blood is decarbonized and recharged with oxygen. The atoms
of this extra oxygen are transmuted into <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> current to rejuvenate
the brain and spinal centers. {FN26-1} By stopping the accumulation
of venous blood, the yogi is able to lessen or prevent the decay of
tissues; the advanced yogi transmutes his cells into pure energy.
Elijah, Jesus, Kabir and other prophets were past masters in the
use of KRIYA or a similar technique, by which they caused their
bodies to dematerialize at will.

KRIYA is an ancient science. Lahiri Mahasaya received it from his
guru, Babaji, who rediscovered and clarified the technique after
it had been lost in the Dark Ages.

"The KRIYA YOGA which I am giving to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> through you in this
nineteenth century," Babaji told Lahiri Mahasaya, "is a revival of

the same science which Krishna gave, millenniums ago, to Arjuna,
and which was later <span class="t6 t10 t15 hoverable">known</span> to Patanjali, and to Christ, St. John,
St. Paul, and other disciples."

KRIYA YOGA is referred to by Krishna, India's greatest prophet, in
a stanza of the BHAGAVAD GITA: "Offering inhaling breath into the
outgoing breath, and offering the outgoing breath into the inhaling
breath, the yogi neutralizes both these breaths; he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> releases
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> force from the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t16 t19 t22 t23 t25 t26 hoverable">heart</span> and brings it under his control."
{FN26-2} The interpretation is: "The yogi arrests decay in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span>
by an addition of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> force, and arrests the mutations of growth
in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> by APAN (eliminating current). <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> neutralizing decay
and growth, by quieting the heart, the yogi learns <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> control."

Krishna <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> relates {FN26-3} that it was he, in a former incarnation,
who communicated the indestructible yoga to an ancient illuminato,
Vivasvat, who gave it to Manu, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> legislator. {FN26-4} He,
in turn, instructed Ikshwaku, the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t28 hoverable">father</span> of India's solar warrior
dynasty. Passing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> to another, the royal yoga was
guarded by the rishis until the coming of the materialistic ages.
{FN26-5} Then, due to priestly secrecy and man's indifference, the
sacred <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> gradually became inaccessible.

KRIYA YOGA is mentioned twice by the ancient sage Patanjali, foremost
exponent of yoga, who wrote: "KRIYA YOGA consists of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> discipline,

mental control, and meditating on AUM." {FN26-6} Patanjali speaks
of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> as the actual Cosmic Sound of AUM heard in meditation. {FN26-7}
AUM is the Creative Word, {FN26-8} the sound of the Vibratory Motor.
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Even</span> the yoga-beginner soon inwardly hears the wondrous sound of
AUM. Receiving this blissful <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> encouragement, the devotee
becomes assured that he is in actual touch with <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> realms.

Patanjali refers a <span class="t6 hoverable">second</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> to the life-control or KRIYA technique
thus: "Liberation can be accomplished by that PRANAYAMA which is
attained by disjoining the course of inspiration and expiration."
{FN26-9}

St. Paul knew KRIYA YOGA, or a technique very similar to it, by
which he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> switch <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> currents to and from the senses. He was
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> able to say: "Verily, I protest by our rejoicing which
I have in Christ, I DIE DAILY." {FN26-10} By daily withdrawing his
bodily <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> force, he united it by yoga union with the rejoicing
(eternal bliss) of the <span class="t3 t7 t12 t17 t19 t24 t26 hoverable">Christ</span> consciousness. In that felicitous
state, he was consciously aware of being dead to the delusive
sensory <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> of MAYA.

In the initial states of God-contact (SABIKALPA SAMADHI) the
devotee's consciousness merges with the Cosmic Spirit; his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span>
force is withdrawn from the body, which appears "dead," or motionless
and rigid. The yogi is fully aware of his bodily condition of

suspended animation. As he progresses to higher <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> states
(NIRBIKALPA SAMADHI), however, he communes with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> bodily
fixation, and in his ordinary waking consciousness, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> in the
midst of exacting worldly duties. {FN26-11}

"KRIYA YOGA is an instrument through which <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> evolution can be
quickened," Sri Yukteswar explained to his students. "The ancient
yogis discovered that the secret of cosmic consciousness is
intimately linked with breath mastery. This is India's unique and
deathless contribution to the world's treasury of knowledge. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span>

stilling the ceaseless demands of the breath."

The KRIYA YOGI mentally directs his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> energy to revolve, upward
and downward, around the six spinal centers (medullary, cervical,

Man. One-half minute of revolution of energy around the sensitive
spinal cord of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> effects subtle progress in his evolution; that

the guidance of a guru, such yogis have carefully prepared their
bodies and brains to receive the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> created by intensive practice.

The KRIYA beginner employs his yogic exercise only fourteen to
twenty-eight times, twice daily. A number of yogis achieve emancipation
in six or twelve or twenty-four or forty-eight years. A yogi who
dies before achieving full realization carries with him the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span>

KRIYA YOGA has <span class="t15 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">nothing</span> in common with the unscientific breathing
exercises taught by a number of misguided zealots. Their attempts
to forcibly hold breath in the lungs is not only unnatural but
decidedly unpleasant. KRIYA, on the other hand, is accompanied
from the very beginning by an accession of peace, and by soothing
sensations of regenerative effect in the spine.

The ancient yogic technique converts the breath into mind. By
<span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> advancement, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> is able to cognize the breath as an act

following some closely knit intellectual argument, or in attempting
some delicate or difficult physical feat, automatically breathes

at the rate of 32 times a minute, in contrast to man's average of
18 times. The elephant, tortoise, snake and other animals noted for
their longevity have a respiratory rate which is less than man's.
The tortoise, for instance, who <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> attain the age of 300 years,

The voluntary yogi performs a simple, natural process consciously,
not unconsciously <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> the slow-paced sleeper. The KRIYA YOGI uses

makes breath unnecessary, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> producing the states of subconscious

By such reinforcement of life, the yogi's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> and brain cells

intellectual reactions, feelings, moods, and habits are circumscribed
by effects of past causes, whether of this or a prior life. Lofty
above such influences, however, is his regal soul. Spurning the
transitory truths and freedoms, the KRIYA YOGI passes beyond all
disillusionment into his unfettered Being. All scriptures declare

was this universe born? Who is its maker? What is its material

has no answer for these questions; hence the rishis evolved yoga
as the technique of <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> inquiry.

KRIYA YOGA is the real "fire rite" often extolled in the BHAGAVAD
GITA. The purifying fires of yoga <span class="t22 hoverable">bring</span> eternal illumination, and

CHAPTER: 27

FOUNDING A YOGA SCHOOL AT RANCHI

"Why are you averse to organizational work?"

Master's question startled me a bit. It is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> that my private
conviction at the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> was that organizations were "hornets' nests."

"It is a thankless task, sir," I answered. "No matter what the
leader does or does not, he is criticized."

"Do you want the <span class="t3 t5 t7 t9 t20 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> CHANNA (milk curd) for yourself alone?"
My guru's retort was accompanied by a stern glance. "Could you or
anyone else achieve God-contact through yoga if a line of generous-hearted
masters had not been willing to convey their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> to others?"
He added, "God is the Honey, organizations are the hives; both are
necessary. Any <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">FORM</span> is useless, of course, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> the spirit, but
why should you not start busy hives full of the <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> nectar?"

His counsel moved me deeply. Although I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> no outward reply, an
adamant resolution arose in my breast: I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> share with my fellows,
so <span class="t6 t9 t18 t26 hoverable">far</span> as lay in my power, the unshackling truths I had learned at
my guru's feet. "Lord," I prayed, "may <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thy</span> <span class="t7 hoverable">Love</span> shine forever on
the sanctuary of my devotion, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> I be able to awaken that <span class="t7 hoverable">Love</span>
in other hearts."

On a previous occasion, before I had joined the monastic order,
Sri Yukteswar had <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> a most unexpected remark.

"How you will miss the companionship of a wife in your <span class="t25 hoverable">old</span> age!" he
had said. "Do you not agree that the family man, engaged in useful

in God's eyes?"

"Sir," I had protested in alarm, "you <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">know</span> that my desire in this

<span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> had laughed so merrily that I understood his observation
was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> merely as a test of my faith.

"Remember," he had <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> slowly, "that he who discards his worldly
duties can justify himself only by assuming some kind of responsibility
toward a <span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">much</span> larger family."

The ideal of an all-sided education for youth had always been close
to my heart. I saw clearly the arid results of ordinary instruction,
aimed only at the development of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> and intellect. Moral and

of manhood. My <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> step in that direction was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> with seven

A year later, in 1918, through the generosity of Sir Manindra
Chandra Nundy, the Maharaja of Kasimbazar, I was able to transfer my
fast-growing group to Ranchi. This town in Bihar, about <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> hundred

climates in India. The Kasimbazar Palace at Ranchi was transformed

into the headquarters for the <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> school, which I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> BRAHMACHARYA
VIDYALAYA {FN27-1} in accordance with the educational ideals
of the rishis. Their forest ashrams had been the ancient seats of
learning, secular and divine, for the youth of India.

At Ranchi I organized an educational program for both grammar
and high school grades. It included agricultural, industrial,
commercial, and academic subjects. The students were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> taught
yoga concentration and meditation, and a unique system of physical

Realizing that man's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> an electric battery, I reasoned
that it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> be recharged with energy through the direct agency of

In the VIDYALAYA I had to play father-mother to the little children,

interpreted these words: "The devotee who forgoes the life-experiences

<span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> withheld because I had hurt him by refusing his offer of a

"Son," he said, "I am now reconciled to your choice in life. It gives

He waved toward a group of a dozen little ones who were tagging at

eyes, "but I can feel for you!"

With a large fruit orchard and twenty-five fertile acres at our

including a young deer who was fairly idolized by the children. I
too loved the fawn so <span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">much</span> that I allowed it to sleep in my room.
At the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> of dawn, the little creature <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> toddle over to my

in the evening, sad news greeted me: "The little fawn is nearly
dead, through over feeding."

In tears, I placed the apparently lifeless pet on my lap. I prayed
piteously to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> to spare its life. Hours later, the small creature
opened its eyes, stood up, and walked feebly. The <span class="t3 t5 t7 t9 t20 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> school
shouted for joy.

But a deep lesson <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> to me that night, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> I can <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> forget.
I stayed up with the fawn until <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> o'clock, when I fell asleep.
The deer appeared in a dream, and spoke to me:

"You are holding me back.

"All right," I answered in the dream.

I awoke immediately, and cried out, "Boys, the deer is dying!" The

I ran to the corner of the room where I had placed the pet. It

to a higher form. But by my deep attachment, which I later realized
was selfish, and by my fervent prayers, I had been able to hold
it in the limitations of the animal <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> from which the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> was
struggling for release.

The Ranchi school grew from small and simple beginnings to an
institution now well-known in India. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Many</span> departments of the school
are supported by voluntary contributions from those who rejoice in
perpetuating the educational ideals of the rishis. Under the general

been established at Midnapore, Lakshmanpur, and Puri.

The Ranchi headquarters maintains a Medical Department where
medicines and the services of doctors are supplied freely to the
poor of the locality. The number treated has averaged more than
18,000 persons a year. The VIDYALAYA has <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> its mark, too, in

the Benares "saint with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> bodies."

the picturesque outdoor classes, held under the trees, and saw in
the evening that young boys were sitting motionless for hours in
yoga meditation, he was profoundly moved.

"Joy comes to my heart," he said, "to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> that Lahiri Mahasaya's

this institution. My guru's blessings be on it."

A young lad sitting by my side ventured to ask the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> yogi a

"Sir," he said, "shall I be a monk? Is my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> only for God?"

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Though</span> Swami Pranabananda smiled gently, his eyes were piercing

"Child," he replied, "when you grow up, there is a beautiful bride

Sometime after Swami Pranabananda had visited Ranchi, I accompanied
my <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t28 hoverable">father</span> to the Calcutta <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> where the yogi was temporarily

As <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t28 hoverable">Father</span> entered the swami's room, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> yogi rose from his

"Bhagabati," he said, "what are you doing about yourself? Don't you

see your <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> racing to the Infinite?" I blushed to hear his praise
before my father. The swami <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> on, "You recall how often our

"Swamiji," I inquired, looking straight into his eyes, "please tell

He smiled angelically. "The Beloved is more than <span class="t29 hoverable">ever</span> with me now."
His complete conviction overwhelmed my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> and soul. He <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> on,
"I am still enjoying the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> pensions-one from Bhagabati here, and

into an ecstasy, his face lit with a <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> glow-an ample answer

Noticing that Pranabananda's room contained <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> plants and packages

"Never again," the saint replied. "This year is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> in which

My eyes filled with tears at his words, but the swami smiled
tranquilly. He reminded me of a little heavenly child, sitting
securely on the lap of the <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Mother. The burden of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span>

Months later I met an <span class="t25 hoverable">old</span> friend, Sanandan, who was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of

"My adorable guru is gone," he told me, amidst sobs. "He established

I inquired why he wanted such a large number.

"'This is my last festival ceremony,' he said. I did not understand

"Pranabanandaji helped with the cooking of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> amounts of food.
We fed about 2000 guests. After the feast, he sat on a high platform
and gave an inspired sermon on the Infinite. At the end, before
the gaze of thousands, he turned to me, as I sat beside him on the
dais, and spoke with unusual force.

"'Sanandan, be prepared; I am going to kick the frame.' {FN27-7}

"After a stunned silence, I cried loudly, 'Master, don't do it!
Please, please, don't do it!' The crowd was tongue-tied, watching
us curiously. My guru smiled at me, but his solemn gaze was already
fixed on Eternity.

"'Be not selfish,' he said, 'nor grieve for me. I have been <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span>
cheerfully serving you all; now rejoice and wish me Godspeed. I
go to meet my Cosmic Beloved.' In a whisper, Pranabanandaji added,
'I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> be reborn shortly. After enjoying a short period of the

"He cried again, 'Sanandan, here I kick the frame by the <span class="t6 hoverable">second</span>
KRIYA YOGA.' {FN27-9}

"He looked at the sea of faces before us, and gave a blessing.
Directing his gaze inwardly to the <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> eye, he became immobile.
While the bewildered crowd <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> he was meditating in an ecstatic
state, he had already left the tabernacle of flesh and plunged
his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> into the cosmic vastness. The disciples touched his body,
seated in the lotus posture, but it was no longer the warm flesh.
Only a stiffened frame remained; the tenant had fled to the immortal
shore."

I inquired where Pranabananda was to be reborn.

"That's a sacred trust I <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">cannot</span> divulge to anyone," Sanandan replied.
"Perhaps you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> find out some other way."

CHAPTER: 28

KASHI, REBORN AND REDISCOVERED

"Please do not go into the water. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Let</span> us bathe by dipping our

buckets."

I was addressing the young Ranchi students who were accompanying
me on an eight-mile hike to a neighboring hill. The pond before
us was inviting, but a distaste for it had arisen in my mind. The
group around me followed my example of dipping buckets, but a few
lads yielded to the temptation of the cool waters. No sooner had
they dived than large <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> snakes wiggled around them. The boys
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> out of the pond with comical alacrity.

We enjoyed a picnic lunch after we reached our destination. I sat
under a tree, surrounded by a group of students. Finding me in an
inspirational mood, they plied me with questions.

"Please tell me, sir," <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> youth inquired, "if I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> always stay
with you in the path of renunciation."

"Ah, no," I replied, "you will be forcibly <span class="t19 hoverable">taken</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">away</span> to your home,
and later you will marry."

Incredulous, he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> a vehement protest. "Only if I am dead can I
be carried home." But in a few months, his parents arrived to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">take</span>
him away, in spite of his tearful resistance; some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span> later, he
did marry.

After answering <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> questions, I was addressed by a lad named
Kashi. He was about twelve <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span> old, a brilliant student, and
beloved by all.

"Sir," he said, "what will be my fate?"

"You <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> soon be dead." The reply <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> from my lips with an
irresistible force.

This unexpected disclosure shocked and grieved me as <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t8 t10 t12 t13 t14 t17 t19 t23 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> as
everyone present. Silently rebuking myself as an ENFANT TERRIBLE,
I refused to answer further questions.

On our return to the school, Kashi <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> to my room.

"If I die, will you find me when I am reborn, and <span class="t22 hoverable">bring</span> me again
to the <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> path?" He sobbed.

I felt constrained to refuse this difficult occult responsibility.
But for weeks afterward, Kashi pressed me doggedly. Seeing him
unnerved to the breaking point, I finally consoled him.

"Yes," I promised. "If the Heavenly <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t28 hoverable">Father</span> lends His aid, I will
try to find you."

During the summer vacation, I started on a short trip. Regretting
that I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">take</span> Kashi with me, I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> him to my room
before leaving, and carefully instructed him to remain, against
all persuasion, in the <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> vibrations of the school. Somehow
I felt that if he did not go home, he <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t18 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">might</span> avoid the impending
calamity.

No sooner had I left than Kashi's <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t28 hoverable">father</span> arrived in Ranchi. For
fifteen <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t11 t20 t26 t27 hoverable">days</span> he tried to break the will of his son, explaining that
if Kashi <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> go to Calcutta for only four <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t11 t20 t26 t27 hoverable">days</span> to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> his mother,
he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> then return. Kashi persistently refused. The <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t28 hoverable">father</span> finally
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">take</span> the boy <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">away</span> with the help of the police. The
threat disturbed Kashi, who was unwilling to be the <span class="t1 t3 t9 t15 t20 t21 t26 t29 hoverable">cause</span> of any
unfavorable publicity to the school. He saw no choice but to go.

I returned to Ranchi a few <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t11 t20 t26 t27 hoverable">days</span> later. When I heard how Kashi had
been removed, I entrained at once for Calcutta. There I engaged a
horse cab. Very strangely, as the vehicle passed beyond the Howrah
bridge over the Ganges, I beheld Kashi's <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t28 hoverable">father</span> and other relatives
in mourning clothes. Shouting to my driver to stop, I rushed out
and glared at the unfortunate father.

"Mr. Murderer," I cried somewhat unreasonably, "you have killed my
boy!"

The <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t28 hoverable">father</span> had already realized the wrong he had done in forcibly
bringing Kashi to Calcutta. During the few <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t11 t20 t26 t27 hoverable">days</span> the boy had been
there, he had eaten contaminated food, contracted cholera, and
passed on.

My <span class="t7 hoverable">love</span> for Kashi, and the pledge to find him after death, night and
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> haunted me. No matter where I went, his face loomed up before
me. I began a memorable search for him, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> as <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> ago I had
searched for my lost mother.

How was I to tune in with him, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span> so <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span>
vibrating lights of other souls?

Using a secret yoga technique, I broadcasted my <span class="t7 hoverable">love</span> to Kashi's
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> through the microphone of the <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> eye, the inner point
between the eyebrows. With the antenna of upraised hands and
fingers, I often turned myself round and round, trying to locate
the direction in which he had been reborn as an embryo. I hoped to
receive response from him in the concentration-tuned radio of my
heart. {FN28-1}

I intuitively felt that Kashi <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> soon return to the earth, and
that if I kept unceasingly broadcasting my call to him, his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span>
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> reply. I knew that the slightest impulse sent by Kashi <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span>
be felt in my fingers, hands, arms, spine, and nerves.

With undiminished zeal, I practiced the yoga method steadily for
about six months after Kashi's death. Walking with a few friends
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> morning in the crowded Bowbazar section of Calcutta, I lifted
my hands in the usual manner. For the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> time, there was response.

I thrilled to detect electrical impulses trickling down my fingers
and palms. These currents translated themselves into <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> overpowering
<span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> from a deep recess of my consciousness: "I am Kashi; I am
Kashi; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> to me!"

The <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> became almost audible as I concentrated on my <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t16 t19 t22 t23 t25 t26 hoverable">heart</span>
radio. In the characteristic, slightly hoarse whisper of Kashi,
{FN28-2} I heard his summons again and again. I seized the arm
of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of my companions, Prokash Das, {FN28-3} and smiled at him
joyfully.

"It looks as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> I have located Kashi!"

I began to turn round and round, to the undisguised amusement of
my friends and the passing throng. The electrical impulses tingled
through my fingers only when I faced toward a near-by path, aptly
named "Serpentine Lane." The astral currents disappeared when I
turned in other directions.

"Ah," I exclaimed, "Kashi's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> be living in the womb of some
mother <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whose</span> home is in this lane."

My companions and I approached closer to Serpentine Lane; the
vibrations in my upraised hands grew stronger, more pronounced.
As if by a magnet, I was pulled toward the <span class="t27 hoverable">right</span> side of the road.

Reaching the entrance of a <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> house, I was astounded to find
myself transfixed. I knocked at the door in a state of intense
excitement, holding my very breath. I felt that the successful <span class="t7 t10 t15 t25 hoverable">end</span>
had <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> for my long, arduous, and certainly unusual quest!

The door was opened by a servant, who told me her <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">master</span> was at
home. He descended the stairway from the <span class="t6 hoverable">second</span> floor and smiled
at me inquiringly. I hardly knew how to frame my question, at once
pertinent and impertinent.

"Please tell me, sir, if you and your wife have been expecting a
child for about six months?"

"Yes, it is so." Seeing that I was a swami, a renunciate attired
in the traditional orange cloth, he added politely, "Pray inform
me how you <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">know</span> my affairs."

When he heard about Kashi and the promise I had given, the astonished
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> believed my story.

"A male child of fair complexion will be born to you," I told him.
"He will have a broad face, with a cowlick atop his forehead. His
disposition will be notably spiritual." I felt <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> that the
coming child <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> bear these resemblances to Kashi.

Later I visited the child, <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whose</span> parents had <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> him his <span class="t25 hoverable">old</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span>
of Kashi. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Even</span> in infancy he was strikingly similar in appearance
to my dear Ranchi student. The child showed me an instantaneous
affection; the attraction of the past awoke with redoubled intensity.

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">Years</span> later the teen-age boy wrote me, during my stay in America.
He explained his deep longing to follow the path of a renunciate.
I directed him to a Himalayan <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">master</span> who, to this day, guides the
reborn Kashi.

{FN28-1} The will, projected from the point between the eyebrows,
is <span class="t6 t10 t15 hoverable">known</span> by yogis as the broadcasting apparatus of thought. When the
feeling is calmly concentrated on the heart, it acts as a mental
radio, and can receive the messages of <span class="t1 t7 t13 hoverable">others</span> from <span class="t6 t9 t18 t26 hoverable">far</span> or near.
In telepathy the fine vibrations of thoughts in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> person's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span>
are transmitted through the subtle vibrations of astral ether and
then through the grosser earthly ether, creating electrical waves
which, in turn, translate themselves into <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> waves in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span>
of the other person.

{FN28-2} <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Every</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> in its pure state is omniscient.

remembered all the characteristics of Kashi, the boy, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span>
mimicked his hoarse voice in <span class="t0 t6 t7 t8 t11 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">order</span> to stir my recognition.

CHAPTER: 29

RABINDRANATH TAGORE AND I COMPARE SCHOOLS

"Rabindranath Tagore taught us to sing, as a natural <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of
self-expression, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> the birds."

Bhola Nath, a bright fourteen-year-old lad at my Ranchi school,
gave me this explanation after I had complimented him <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> morning
on his melodious outbursts. With or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> provocation, the boy
poured <span class="t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t9 t10 t11 t13 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">forth</span> a tuneful stream. He had previously attended the famous
Tagore school of "Santiniketan" (Haven of Peace) at Bolpur.

"The songs of Rabindranath have been on my lips since early youth,"
I told my companion. "All Bengal, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> the unlettered peasants,
delights in his lofty verse."

Bhola and I sang <span class="t16 t21 hoverable">together</span> a few refrains from Tagore, who has <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t15 t17 t18 t19 hoverable">set</span>
to music thousands of Indian poems, some original and <span class="t1 t7 t13 hoverable">others</span> of
hoary antiquity.

"I met Rabindranath soon after he had received the Nobel Prize
for literature," I remarked after our vocalizing. "I was drawn to
visit him because I admired his undiplomatic courage in disposing
of his literary critics." I chuckled.

Bhola curiously inquired the story.

"The scholars severely flayed Tagore for introducing a <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> style
into Bengali poetry," I began. "He mixed colloquial and classical
expressions, ignoring all the prescribed limitations dear to
the pundits' hearts. His songs embody deep philosophic <span class="t3 t7 t9 t10 t15 t19 t22 hoverable">truth</span> in
emotionally appealing terms, with little regard for the accepted
literary forms.

"One influential critic slightingly referred to Rabindranath
as a 'pigeon-poet who sold his cooings in print for a rupee.' But
Tagore's revenge was at hand; the <span class="t3 t5 t7 t9 t20 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> Western <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> paid homage
at his feet soon after he had translated into English his GITANJALI
('Song Offerings'). A trainload of pundits, including his one-time
critics, <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> to Santiniketan to offer their congratulations.

"Rabindranath received his guests only after an intentionally <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span>
delay, and then heard their praise in stoic silence. Finally he
turned against them their own habitual weapons of criticism.

"'Gentlemen,' he said, 'the fragrant honors you here bestow are
incongruously mingled with the putrid odors of your past contempt.
Is there possibly any connection between my award of the Nobel
Prize, and your suddenly acute powers of appreciation? I am still
the same poet who displeased you when I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> offered my humble
flowers at the shrine of Bengal.'

"The newspapers published an account of the bold chastisement <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span>
by Tagore. I admired the outspoken <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">words</span> of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> unhypnotized by
flattery," I <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> on. "I was introduced to Rabindranath in Calcutta
by his secretary, Mr. C. F. Andrews, {FN29-1} who was simply attired
in a Bengali DHOTI. He referred lovingly to Tagore as his GURUDEVA.

"Rabindranath received me graciously. He emanated a soothing aura
of charm, culture, and courtliness. Replying to my question about
his literary background, Tagore told me that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> ancient source of
his inspiration, besides our religious epics, had been the classical
poet, Bidyapati."

Inspired by these memories, I began to sing Tagore's version of an
<span class="t25 hoverable">old</span> Bengali song, "Light the Lamp of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thy</span> Love." Bhola and I chanted
joyously as we strolled over the VIDYALAYA grounds.

About <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span> after founding the Ranchi school, I received an
invitation from Rabindranath to visit him at Santiniketan in <span class="t0 t6 t7 t8 t11 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">order</span>

to discuss our educational ideals. I <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> gladly. The poet was
seated in his study when I entered; I <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> then, as at our <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span>
meeting, that he was as striking a model of superb manhood as any
painter <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> desire. His beautifully chiseled face, nobly patrician,
was framed in <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> hair and flowing beard. Large, melting eyes; an
angelic smile; and a voice of flutelike quality which was literally
enchanting. Stalwart, tall, and grave, he combined an almost
womanly tenderness with the delightful spontaneity of a child. No
idealized conception of a poet <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> find more suitable embodiment
than in this gentle singer.

Tagore and I were soon deep in a comparative study of our schools,
both founded along unorthodox lines. We discovered <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> identical
features-outdoor instruction, simplicity, ample scope for the
child's creative spirit. Rabindranath, however, laid considerable
stress on the study of literature and poetry, and the self-expression
through music and song which I had already noted in the case of
Bhola. The Santiniketan <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">children</span> observed periods of silence, but
were <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> no special yoga training.

The poet listened with flattering attention to my description of the
energizing "Yogoda" exercises and the yoga concentration techniques
which are taught to all students at Ranchi.

Tagore told me of his own early educational struggles. "I fled from

school after the fifth grade," he said, laughing. I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> readily
understand how his innate poetic delicacy had been affronted by
the dreary, disciplinary atmosphere of a schoolroom.

"That is why I opened Santiniketan under the shady trees and
the glories of the sky." He motioned eloquently to a little group
studying in the beautiful garden. "A child is in his natural setting
amidst the flowers and songbirds.

I agreed. "The idealistic and hero-worshiping instincts of the young
are starved on an exclusive diet of statistics and chronological
eras."

The poet spoke lovingly of his father, Devendranath, who had inspired
the Santiniketan beginnings.

"Father presented me with this fertile land, where he had already
built a guest <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> and temple," Rabindranath told me. "I started
my educational experiment here in 1901, with only ten boys. The
eight thousand pounds which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> with the Nobel Prize all <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> for
the upkeep of the school."

The elder Tagore, Devendranath, <span class="t6 t10 t15 hoverable">known</span> <span class="t6 t9 t18 t26 hoverable">far</span> and wide as "Maharishi,"
was a very remarkable man, as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> discover from his AUTOBIOGRAPHY.

In
turn, his father, Dwarkanath Tagore, had been celebrated throughout
Bengal for his munificent public benefactions. From this illustrious
tree has sprung a family of geniuses. Not Rabindranath alone; all
his relatives have distinguished themselves in creative expression.
His brothers, Gogonendra and Abanindra, are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span> the foremost artists

respond.

Rabindranath invited me to stay overnight in the guest house. It
was indeed a charming spectacle, in the evening, to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> the poet
seated with a group in the patio. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Time</span> unfolded backward: the scene

encircled by his devotees, all aureoled in <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> love. Tagore
knitted each tie with the cords of harmony. <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">Never</span> assertive, he drew
and captured the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t16 t19 t22 t23 t25 t26 hoverable">heart</span> by an irresistible magnetism. Rare blossom
of poesy blooming in the garden of the Lord, attracting <span class="t1 t7 t13 hoverable">others</span> by
a natural fragrance!

In his melodious voice, Rabindranath read to us a few of his exquisite
poems, newly created. Most of his songs and plays, <span class="t23 hoverable">written</span> for the

delectation of his students, have been composed at Santiniketan.
The beauty of his lines, to me, lies in his art of referring to
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> in nearly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> stanza, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> seldom mentioning the sacred Name.
"Drunk with the bliss of singing," he wrote, "I forget myself and

The following day, after lunch, I bade the poet a reluctant farewell.
I rejoice that his little school has now grown to an international
university, "Viswa-Bharati," where scholars of all lands have <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span>
an ideal setting.

HERMITS. His friend Nicholas Roerich {FN30-1} has summarized the
tale, as follows:

"On an island there lived <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> <span class="t25 hoverable">old</span> hermits. They were so simple that
the only prayer they <span class="t27 hoverable">used</span> was: 'We are three; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thou</span> art Three-have

prayer.

"The local bishop {FN30-2} <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> to hear about the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> hermits

to teach them the canonical invocations. He arrived on the island,
told the hermits that their heavenly petition was undignified, and
taught them <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> of the customary prayers. The bishop then left
on a boat. He saw, following the ship, a radiant light. As it
approached, he discerned the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> hermits, who were holding hands

"'We have forgotten the prayers you taught us,' they cried as they
reached the bishop, 'and have hastened to ask you to repeat them.'
The awed bishop shook his head.

"'Dear ones,' he replied humbly, 'continue to live with your <span class="t25 hoverable">old</span>
prayer!'"

How did the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> saints walk on the water?

To surmount MAYA was the task assigned to the <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> race by the

the unity of the Creator was conceived of as man's <span class="t6 t9 t22 t29 hoverable">highest</span> goal.
Those who cling to the cosmic illusion <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> accept its essential <span class="t0 t8 t12 t15 t19 t23 t25 hoverable">law</span>

the compulsions of MAYA.

To tear the veil of MAYA is to pierce the secret of creation. The

In his famous equation outlining the equivalence of mass and energy,
Einstein proved that the energy in any particle of matter is equal
to its mass or weight multiplied by the square of the velocity of
light. The release of the atomic energies is <span class="t2 t4 t5 t22 t23 hoverable">brought</span> about through
the annihilation of the material particles. The "death" of matter
has been the "birth" of an Atomic Age.

Light-velocity is a mathematical standard or constant not because
there is an absolute value in 186,000 miles a second, but because
no material body, <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whose</span> mass increases with its velocity, can <span class="t29 hoverable">ever</span>

THIS CONCEPTION BRINGS US TO THE <span class="t0 t8 t12 t15 t19 t23 t25 hoverable">LAW</span> OF MIRACLES.

The masters who are able to materialize and dematerialize their

bodies or any other object, and to move with the velocity of light,
and to utilize the creative light-rays in bringing into instant
visibility any physical manifestation, have fulfilled the necessary
Einsteinian condition: their mass is infinite.

The consciousness of a perfected yogi is effortlessly identified,
not with a narrow body, but with the universal structure. Gravitation,
whether the "force" of Newton or the Einsteinian "manifestation of
inertia," is powerless to COMPEL a <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">master</span> to exhibit the property
of "weight" which is the distinguishing gravitational condition
of all material objects. He who knows himself as the omnipresent
<span class="t0 t1 t3 t5 t7 t8 t13 t16 t18 t20 t21 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">Spirit</span> is subject no longer to the rigidities of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span>
and space. Their imprisoning "rings-pass-not" have yielded to the
solvent: "I am He."

"Fiat lux! And there was light." God's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> command to His ordered

A yogi who through perfect meditation has merged his consciousness
with the Creator perceives the cosmical essence as light; to him

there is no difference between the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> rays composing <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> and

on the liberating <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> eye has enabled the yogi to destroy
all delusions concerning matter and its gravitational weight;
thenceforth he sees the universe as an essentially undifferentiated
mass of light.

"Optical images," Dr. L. T. Troland of Harvard tells us, "are built
up on the same principle as the ordinary 'half-tone' engravings;
that is, they are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> up of minute dottings or stripplings <span class="t6 t9 t18 t26 hoverable">far</span>

of the projection-whether it be a tree, a medicine, a <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> body-is
in conformance with a yogi's powers of will and of visualization.

In man's dream-consciousness, where he has loosened in sleep his
clutch on the egoistic limitations that daily hem him round, the
omnipotence of his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> has a nightly demonstration. Lo! there in
the dream stand the long-dead friends, the remotest continents, the

consciousness, <span class="t6 t10 t15 hoverable">known</span> to all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> in the phenomena of dreams, the
God-tuned <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">master</span> has forged a never-severed link. Innocent of all
personal motives, and employing the creative will bestowed on him
by the Creator, a yogi rearranges the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> atoms of the universe

In 1915, shortly after I had entered the Swami Order, I witnessed
a vision of violent contrasts. In it the relativity of <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span>
consciousness was vividly established; I clearly perceived the
unity of the Eternal <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Light</span> behind the painful dualities of MAYA.
The vision descended on me as I sat <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> morning in my little attic
room in Father's Gurpar Road home. For months <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">World</span> War I had been
raging in Europe; I reflected sadly on the vast toll of death.

As I closed my eyes in meditation, my consciousness was suddenly
transferred to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> of a captain in command of a battleship.
The thunder of guns split the air as shots were exchanged between

shore batteries and the ship's cannons. A huge shell hit the powder
magazine and tore my ship asunder. I jumped into the water, <span class="t16 t21 hoverable">together</span>
with the few sailors who had survived the explosion.

<span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t16 t19 t22 t23 t25 t26 hoverable">Heart</span> pounding, I reached the shore safely. But alas! a stray
bullet ended its furious flight in my chest. I fell groaning to the
ground.

"At last the mysterious footstep of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">Death</span> has caught up with me,"
I thought. With a final sigh, I was about to sink into unconsciousness
when lo! I <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> myself seated in the lotus posture in my Gurpar
Road room.

Hysterical tears poured <span class="t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t9 t10 t11 t13 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">forth</span> as I joyfully stroked and pinched my

I rocked to and fro, inhaling and exhaling to assure myself that
I was alive. Amidst these self-congratulations, again I <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> my
consciousness transferred to the captain's dead <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> by the gory

"What has <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> to do with Light?

As steps in man's awakening, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> inspires scientists to

wonders of the motion picture, of radio, of television, of radar,
of the photo-electric cell-the all-seeing "electric eye," of atomic
energies, are all based on the electromagnetic phenomenon of light.

The motion picture art can portray any miracle. From the impressive
visual standpoint, no marvel is barred to trick photography. A man's
transparent astral <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> can be seen rising from his gross physical
form, he can walk on the water, resurrect the dead, reverse the
natural sequence of developments, and play havoc with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> and

achieves optical wonders which a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">master</span> produces with actual

The lifelike images of the motion picture illustrate <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> truths
concerning creation. The Cosmic Director has <span class="t23 hoverable">written</span> His own plays,
and assembled the tremendous casts for the pageant of the centuries.

From the dark booth of eternity, He pours His creative beam through
the films of successive ages, and the pictures are thrown on the
screen of space. Just as the motion-picture images appear to be real,
but are only combinations of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> and shade, so is the universal
variety a delusive seeming. The planetary spheres, with their
countless forms of life, are naught but figures in a cosmic motion
picture, temporarily <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> to five sense perceptions as the scenes
are cast on the screen of man's consciousness by the infinite
creative beam.

A cinema audience can look up and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> that all screen images are

light. The colorful universal drama is similarly issuing from the

European battlefields. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">World</span> War I was still being waged in the
West; the newsreel recorded the carnage with such realism that I
left the theater with a troubled heart.

"Lord," I prayed, "why dost <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thou</span> permit such suffering?"

To my intense surprise, an instant answer <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> in the <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of

a vision of the actual European battlefields. The horror of the
struggle, filled with the dead and dying, <span class="t6 t9 t18 t26 hoverable">far</span> surpassed in ferocity
any representation of the newsreel.

"Look intently!" A gentle voice spoke to my inner consciousness. "You
will <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> that these scenes now being enacted in France are <span class="t15 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">nothing</span>
but a play of chiaroscuro. They are the cosmic motion picture, as
real and as unreal as the theater newsreel you have just seen-a
play <span class="t5 t7 hoverable">within</span> a play."

My <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t16 t19 t22 t23 t25 t26 hoverable">heart</span> was still not comforted. The <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> voice <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> on: "Creation

Although I had read scriptural accounts of MAYA, they had not <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span>
me the deep insight that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> with the personal visions and their

changed when he is finally convinced that <span class="t14 hoverable">creation</span> is only a vast

motion picture, and that not in it, but beyond it, lies his own
reality.

As I finished writing this chapter, I sat on my bed in the lotus
posture. My room was dimly lit by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> shaded lamps. Lifting my gaze,
I noticed that the ceiling was dotted with small mustard-colored
lights, scintillating and quivering with a radiumlike luster.
Myriads of pencilled rays, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> sheets of rain, gathered into a
transparent shaft and poured silently <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> me.

At once my physical <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> lost its grossness and became metamorphosed
into astral texture. I felt a floating sensation as, barely touching
the bed, the weightless <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> shifted slightly and alternately to
left and right. I looked around the room; the furniture and walls
were as usual, but the little mass of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> had so multiplied that
the ceiling was invisible. I was wonder-struck.

"This is the cosmic motion picture mechanism." A voice spoke
as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> from <span class="t5 t7 hoverable">within</span> the light. "Shedding its beam on the white
screen of your bed sheets, it is producing the picture of your
body. Behold, your <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> is <span class="t15 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">nothing</span> but light!"

I gazed at my arms and moved them back and forth, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> not feel
their weight. An ecstatic joy overwhelmed me. This cosmic stem of
light, blossoming as my body, seemed a <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> replica of the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span>

beams streaming out of the projection booth in a cinema <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> and
manifesting as pictures on the screen.

For a <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> I experienced this motion picture of my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> in the
dimly lighted theater of my own bedroom. Despite the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> visions
I have had, none was <span class="t29 hoverable">ever</span> more singular. As my illusion of a solid

the essence of all objects is light, I looked up to the throbbing
stream of lifetrons and spoke entreatingly.

"Divine Light, please withdraw this, my humble bodily picture, into
Thyself, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> as Elijah was drawn up to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t15 t18 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heaven</span> by a flame."

This prayer was evidently startling; the beam disappeared. My <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span>
resumed its normal weight and sank on the bed; the swarm of dazzling
ceiling lights flickered and vanished. My <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> to leave this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span>
had apparently not arrived.

"Besides," I <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> philosophically, "the prophet Elijah <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t18 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">might</span>

CHAPTER: 31

AN INTERVIEW WITH THE SACRED MOTHER

"Reverend Mother, I was baptized in infancy by your prophet-husband.
He was the guru of my parents and of my own guru Sri Yukteswarji.
Will you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> me the privilege of hearing a few incidents
in your sacred life?"

I was addressing Srimati Kashi Moni, the life-companion of Lahiri
Mahasaya. Finding myself in Benares for a short period, I was
fulfilling a long-felt desire to visit the venerable lady. She
received me graciously at the <span class="t25 hoverable">old</span> Lahiri homestead in the Garudeswar
Mohulla section of Benares. Although aged, she was blooming <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> a
lotus, silently emanating a <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> fragrance. She was of medium
build, with a slender neck and fair skin. Large, lustrous eyes
softened her motherly face.

"Son, you are welcome here. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Come</span> upstairs."

Kashi Moni led the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> to a very small room where, for a time, she
had lived with her husband. I felt honored to witness the shrine
in which the peerless <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">master</span> had condescended to play the <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span>
drama of matrimony. The gentle lady motioned me to a pillow seat
by her side.

"It was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span> before I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> to realize the <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> stature of my
husband," she began. "One night, in this very room, I had a vivid
dream. Glorious angels floated in unimaginable grace above me. So
realistic was the sight that I awoke at once; the room was strangely
enveloped in dazzling light.

"My husband, in lotus posture, was levitated in the center of
the room, surrounded by angels who were worshiping him with the
supplicating dignity of palm-folded hands. Astonished beyond measure,
I was convinced that I was still dreaming.

"'Woman,' Lahiri Mahasaya said, 'you are not dreaming. Forsake your
sleep forever and forever.' As he slowly descended to the floor,
I prostrated myself at his feet.

"'Master,' I cried, 'again and again I bow before you! Will you
pardon me for having considered you as my husband? I die with shame
to realize that I have remained asleep in ignorance by the side of
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> who is divinely awakened. From this night, you are no longer
my husband, but my guru. Will you accept my insignificant <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">self</span> as
your disciple?' {FN31-1}

"The <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">master</span> touched me gently. 'Sacred soul, arise. You are
accepted.' He motioned toward the angels. 'Please bow in turn to
each of these <span class="t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t12 t15 t19 t20 t23 t25 hoverable">holy</span> saints.'

"When I had finished my humble genuflections, the angelic voices
sounded together, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> a chorus from an ancient scripture.

"'Consort of the <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> One, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thou</span> art blessed. We salute thee.'
They bowed at my feet and lo! their refulgent forms vanished. The
room darkened.

"My guru asked me to receive initiation into KRIYA YOGA.

"'Of course,' I responded. 'I am sorry not to have had its blessing
earlier in my life.'

"'The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> was not ripe.' Lahiri Mahasaya smiled consolingly. 'Much
of your karma I have silently helped you to <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t7 t10 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> out. Now you are
willing and ready.'

"He touched my forehead. Masses of whirling <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> appeared; the
radiance gradually formed itself into the opal-blue <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> eye,
ringed in gold and centered with a white pentagonal star.

"'Penetrate your consciousness through the star into the kingdom
of the Infinite.' My guru's voice had a <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> note, soft <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> distant
music.

"Vision after vision broke as oceanic surf on the shores of
my soul. The panoramic spheres finally melted in a sea of bliss.
I lost myself in ever-surging blessedness. When I returned hours
later to awareness of this world, the <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">master</span> gave me the technique
of KRIYA YOGA.

"From that night on, Lahiri Mahasaya <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> slept in my room again.
Nor, thereafter, did he <span class="t29 hoverable">ever</span> sleep. He remained in the front room
downstairs, in the company of his disciples both by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> and by
night."

The illustrious lady fell into silence. Realizing the uniqueness
of her relationship with the sublime yogi, I finally ventured to
ask for further reminiscences.

"Son, you are greedy. Nevertheless you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> have <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> more story."
She smiled shyly. "I will confess a <span class="t26 hoverable">sin</span> which I committed against
my guru-husband. Some months after my initiation, I began to feel
forlorn and neglected. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">One</span> morning Lahiri Mahasaya entered this
little room to fetch an article; I quickly followed him. Overcome
by violent delusion, I addressed him scathingly.

"'You spend all your <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> with the disciples. What about your
responsibilities for your wife and children? I regret that you do
not interest yourself in providing more money for the family.'

"The <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">master</span> glanced at me for a moment, then lo! he was gone. Awed
and frightened, I heard a voice resounding from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of the
room:

"'It is all nothing, don't you see? How <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> a <span class="t15 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">nothing</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> me
produce riches for you?'

"'Guruji,' I cried, 'I implore pardon a million times! My sinful
eyes can <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> you no more; please appear in your sacred form.'

"'I am here.' This reply <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> from above me. I looked up and saw
the <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">master</span> materialize in the air, his head touching the ceiling.
His eyes were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> blinding flames. Beside myself with fear, I lay
sobbing at his feet after he had quietly descended to the floor.

"'Woman,' he said, 'seek <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> wealth, not the paltry tinsel of
earth. After acquiring inward treasure, you will find that outward
supply is always forthcoming.' He added, 'One of my <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t0 t3 t4 t24 hoverable">sons</span>
will <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> provision for you.'

"My guru's <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">words</span> naturally <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> true; a disciple did leave a
considerable sum for our family."

I thanked Kashi Moni for sharing with me her wondrous experiences.

{FN31-2} On the following <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> I returned to her home and enjoyed
several hours of philosophical discussion with Tincouri and Ducouri
Lahiri. These <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> saintly <span class="t0 t3 t4 t24 hoverable">sons</span> of India's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> yogi followed
closely in his ideal footsteps. Both <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> were fair, tall, stalwart,
and heavily bearded, with soft voices and an old-fashioned charm
of manner.

His wife was not the only woman disciple of Lahiri Mahasaya; there
were hundreds of others, including my mother. A woman chela once
asked the guru for his photograph. He handed her a print, remarking,
"If you deem it a protection, then it is so; otherwise it is only
a picture."

A few <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t11 t20 t26 t27 hoverable">days</span> later this woman and Lahiri Mahasaya's daughter-in-law
happened to be studying the BHAGAVAD GITA at a table behind which
hung the guru's photograph. An electrical storm broke out with
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> fury.

"Lahiri Mahasaya, protect us!" The women bowed before the picture.
Lightning struck the <span class="t25 hoverable">book</span> which they had been reading, but the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span>
devotees were unhurt.

"I felt as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> a sheet of ice had been placed around me to ward
off the scorching heat," the chela explained.

Lahiri Mahasaya performed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> miracles in connection with a woman
disciple, Abhoya. She and her husband, a Calcutta lawyer, started
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> for Benares to visit the guru. Their carriage was delayed
by heavy traffic; they reached the Howrah main station only to hear
the Benares train whistling for departure.

Abhoya, near the ticket office, stood quietly.

"Lahiri Mahasaya, I beseech <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thee</span> to stop the train!" she silently
prayed. "I <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">cannot</span> suffer the pangs of delay in waiting <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">another</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span>
to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> thee."

The wheels of the snorting train continued to move round and
round, but there was no onward progress. The engineer and passengers
descended to the platform to view the phenomenon. An English
railroad guard approached Abhoya and her husband. Contrary to all
precedent, he volunteered his services.

"Babu," he said, "give me the money. I will buy your tickets while
you get aboard."

As soon as the couple was seated and had received the tickets, the
train slowly moved forward. In panic, the engineer and passengers
clambered again to their places, knowing <span class="t4 t18 t22 hoverable">neither</span> how the train
started, nor why it had stopped in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> place.

Arriving at the home of Lahiri Mahasaya in Benares, Abhoya silently
prostrated herself before the master, and tried to touch his feet.

"Compose yourself, Abhoya," he remarked. "How you <span class="t7 hoverable">love</span> to bother
me! As if you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> not have <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> here by the next train!"

Abhoya visited Lahiri Mahasaya on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">another</span> memorable occasion. This
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> she wanted his intercession, not with a train, but with the
stork.

"I pray you to bless me that my ninth child <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> live," she said.
"Eight babies have been born to me; all died soon after birth."

The <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">master</span> smiled sympathetically. "Your coming child will live.
Please follow my instructions carefully. The baby, a girl, will be
born at night. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">See</span> that the oil lamp is kept burning until dawn.
Do not fall asleep and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> allow the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> to <span class="t8 t13 hoverable">become</span> extinguished."

Abhoya's child was a daughter, born at night, exactly as foreseen
by the omniscient guru. The mother instructed her nurse to keep
the lamp filled with oil. Both women kept the urgent vigil <span class="t6 t9 t18 t26 hoverable">far</span> into
the early morning hours, but finally fell asleep. The lamp oil was
almost gone; the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> flickered feebly.

The bedroom door unlatched and flew open with a violent sound.
The startled women awoke. Their astonished eyes beheld the <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of
Lahiri Mahasaya.

"Abhoya, behold, the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> is almost gone!" He pointed to the lamp,
which the nurse hastened to refill. As soon as it burned again
brightly, the <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">master</span> vanished. The door closed; the latch was
affixed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> visible agency.

Abhoya's ninth child survived; in 1935, when I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> inquiry, she
was still living.

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">One</span> of Lahiri Mahasaya's disciples, the venerable Kali Kumar Roy,
related to me <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> fascinating details of his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> with the master.

"I was often a guest at his Benares home for weeks at a time,"
Roy told me. "I observed that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> saintly figures, DANDA {FN31-3}
swamis, arrived in the quiet of night to sit at the guru's feet.
Sometimes they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> engage in discussion of meditational and
philosophical points. At dawn the exalted guests <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> depart. I
<span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> during my visits that Lahiri Mahasaya did not once lie down
to sleep.

"During an early period of my association with the master, I had
to contend with the opposition of my employer," Roy <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> on. "He

was steeped in materialism.

"'I don't want religious fanatics on my staff,' he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> sneer.
'If I <span class="t29 hoverable">ever</span> meet your charlatan guru, I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> him some <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">words</span>

"This alarming threat failed to interrupt my regular program; I spent
nearly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> evening in my guru's presence. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">One</span> night my employer
followed me and rushed rudely into the parlor. He was doubtless
fully bent on uttering the pulverizing remarks he had promised. No
sooner had the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> seated himself than Lahiri Mahasaya addressed
the little group of about twelve disciples.

"'Would you all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> a picture?'

"When we nodded, he asked us to darken the room. 'Sit behind <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span>

"I was not surprised to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> that my employer <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> was following,
albeit unwillingly, the master's directions. In a few minutes Lahiri
Mahasaya asked us what we were seeing.

"'Sir,' I replied, 'a beautiful woman appears. She wears a
red-bordered SARI, and stands near an elephant-ear plant.' All the

other disciples gave the same description. The <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">master</span> turned to my
employer. 'Do you recognize that woman?'

"'Yes.' The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> was evidently struggling with emotions <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> to his

the improbability of the man's initiation."

Lahiri Mahasaya had a very famous friend, Swami Trailanga, who was
reputed to be over <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> hundred <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span> old. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> yogis often
sat <span class="t16 t21 hoverable">together</span> in meditation. Trailanga's fame is so widespread that
few Hindus <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> deny the possibility of <span class="t3 t7 t9 t10 t15 t19 t22 hoverable">truth</span> in any story of his
astounding miracles. If <span class="t3 t7 t12 t17 t19 t24 t26 hoverable">Christ</span> returned to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> and walked the

the same excitement that was created by Trailanga decades ago as
he passed through the crowded lanes of Benares.

On <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> occasions the swami was seen to drink, with no ill effect,
the most deadly poisons. Thousands of people, including a few who
are still living, have seen Trailanga floating on the Ganges. For
<span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t11 t20 t26 t27 hoverable">days</span> <span class="t16 t21 hoverable">together</span> he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> sit on top of the water, or remain hidden
for very <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> periods under the waves. A common sight at the Benares
bathing GHATS was the swami's motionless <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> on the blistering
stone slabs, wholly exposed to the merciless Indian sun. By these
feats Trailanga sought to teach <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> that a yogi's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> does not

exposed to the fierce solar rays, the <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">master</span> proved that he lived

As he ate very seldom, the mystery is increased. A master, however,
easily ignores all usual rules of health, when he desires to do so
for some special reason, often a subtle <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> <span class="t6 t10 t15 hoverable">known</span> only to himself.

swami, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> the early Adam in the garden of Eden, was utterly
unconscious of his nakedness. The police were quite conscious of
it, however, and unceremoniously committed him to jail. General
embarrassment ensued; the enormous <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> of Trailanga was soon seen,
in its usual entirety, on the prison roof. His cell, still securely
locked, offered no clue to his mode of escape.

The discouraged officers of the <span class="t0 t8 t12 t15 t19 t23 t25 hoverable">law</span> once more performed their duty.
This <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> a guard was posted before the swami's cell. <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t18 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Might</span> again
retired before right. Trailanga was soon observed in his nonchalant
stroll over the roof. Justice is blind; the outwitted police decided
to follow her example.

The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> yogi preserved a habitual silence. {FN31-4} In spite of
his round face and huge, barrel-like stomach, Trailanga ate only
occasionally. After weeks <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> food, he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> break his fast
with potfuls of clabbered milk offered to him by devotees. A skeptic
once determined to expose Trailanga as a charlatan. A large bucket
of calcium-lime mixture, <span class="t27 hoverable">used</span> in whitewashing walls, was placed
before the swami.

"Master," the materialist said, in mock reverence, "I have <span class="t2 t4 t5 t22 t23 hoverable">brought</span>

you some clabbered milk. Please drink it."

Trailanga unhesitatingly drained, to the last drop, the containerful
of burning lime. In a few minutes the evildoer fell to the ground
in agony.

"Help, swami, help!" he cried. "I am on fire! Forgive my wicked
test!"

The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> yogi broke his habitual silence. "Scoffer," he said,
"you did not realize when you offered me poison that my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> is

play tricks on anyone."

The well-purged sinner, healed by Trailanga's words, slunk feebly
away.

The reversal of pain was not due to any volition of the master,
but <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> about through unerring application of the <span class="t0 t8 t12 t15 t19 t23 t25 hoverable">law</span> of justice
which upholds creation's farthest swinging orb. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Men</span> of God-realization

they have banished forever all thwarting crosscurrents of ego.

The automatic adjustments of righteousness, often paid in an unexpected
coin as in the case of Trailanga and his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be murderer, assuage

I will repay, <span class="t4 hoverable">saith</span> the Lord." {FN31-5} What need for man's brief
resources? the universe duly conspires for retribution. Dull minds
discredit the possibility of <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> justice, love, omniscience,
immortality. "Airy scriptural conjectures!" This insensitive
viewpoint, aweless before the cosmic spectacle, arouses a train of
events which brings its own awakening.

The omnipotence of <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t0 t8 t12 t15 t19 t23 t25 hoverable">law</span> was referred to by <span class="t3 t7 t12 t17 t19 t24 t26 hoverable">Christ</span> on the
occasion of his triumphant entry into Jerusalem. As the disciples
and the multitude shouted for joy, and cried, "Peace in heaven, and
glory in the highest," <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> Pharisees complained of the undignified
spectacle. "Master," they protested, "rebuke <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thy</span> disciples."

"I tell you," <span class="t4 t17 t22 hoverable">Jesus</span> replied, "that, if these should hold their
peace, the stones <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> immediately cry out." {FN31-6}

In this reprimand to the Pharisees, <span class="t3 t7 t12 t17 t19 t24 t26 hoverable">Christ</span> was pointing out that
<span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> justice is no figurative abstraction, and that a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> of

"Think you," <span class="t4 t17 t22 hoverable">Jesus</span> was saying, "to silence <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> of peace?

The grace of the Christlike yogi, Trailanga, was once bestowed on
my SAJO MAMA (maternal uncle). <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">One</span> morning Uncle saw the <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">master</span>
surrounded by a crowd of devotees at a Benares ghat. He managed
to edge his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> close to Trailanga, <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whose</span> feet he touched humbly.

the swami's training from her early childhood. She lived for
forty <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span> in a <span class="t14 hoverable">series</span> of lonely Himalayan caves near Badrinath,
Kedarnath, Amarnath, and Pasupatinath. The BRAHMACHARINI (woman
ascetic), born in 1826, is now <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t8 t10 t12 t13 t14 t17 t19 t23 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> over the century mark. Not aged
in appearance, however, she has retained her black hair, sparkling
teeth, and amazing energy. She comes out of her seclusion <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span>

This woman saint often visited Lahiri Mahasaya. She has related
that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> day, in the Barackpur section near Calcutta, while she was
sitting by Lahiri Mahasaya's side, his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> guru Babaji quietly
entered the room and held converse with them both.

On <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> occasion her <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">master</span> Trailanga, forsaking his usual silence,
honored Lahiri Mahasaya very pointedly in public. A Benares disciple
objected.

"Sir," he said, "why do you, a swami and a renunciate, show such
respect to a householder?"

"My son," Trailanga replied, "Lahiri Mahasaya is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> a <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span>

"Now a <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> was sick, named Lazarus. . . . When <span class="t4 t17 t22 hoverable">Jesus</span> heard
that, he said, This sickness is not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">unto</span> death, but for the glory
of God, that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Son</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t18 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">might</span> be glorified thereby.'" {FN32-1}

Sri Yukteswar was expounding the Christian scriptures <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> sunny
morning on the balcony of his Serampore hermitage. Besides a few
of Master's other disciples, I was present with a small group of
my Ranchi students.

"In this passage <span class="t4 t17 t22 hoverable">Jesus</span> calls himself the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Son</span> of God. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Though</span> he was
truly united with God, his reference here has a deep impersonal
significance," my guru explained. "The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Son</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> is the <span class="t3 t7 t12 t17 t19 t24 t26 hoverable">Christ</span> or
<span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Consciousness in man. No MORTAL can glorify God. The only
honor that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> can pay his Creator is to seek Him; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">cannot</span> glorify
an Abstraction that he does not know. The 'glory' or nimbus around
the head of the saints is a symbolic witness of their CAPACITY to
render <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> homage."

Sri Yukteswar <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> on to read the marvelous story of Lazarus'
resurrection. At its conclusion <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> fell into a <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> silence,
the sacred <span class="t25 hoverable">book</span> open on his knee.

"I too was privileged to <span class="t0 t5 t16 t22 hoverable">behold</span> a similar miracle." My guru finally
spoke with solemn unction. "Lahiri Mahasaya resurrected <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of my
friends from the dead."

The young lads at my side smiled with keen interest. There was
enough of the boy in me, too, to enjoy not only the philosophy
but, in particular, any story I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> get Sri Yukteswar to relate
about his wondrous experiences with his guru.

"My friend Rama and I were inseparable," <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> began. "Because he
was shy and reclusive, he chose to visit our guru Lahiri Mahasaya
only during the hours of midnight and dawn, when the crowd of
daytime disciples was absent. As Rama's closest friend, I served as
a <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> vent through which he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">let</span> out the wealth of his <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span>
perceptions. I <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> inspiration in his ideal companionship." My
guru's face softened with memories.

"Rama was suddenly <span class="t0 t2 t16 t18 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">put</span> to a severe test," Sri Yukteswar continued.
"He contracted the disease of Asiatic cholera. As our <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">master</span> <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span>
objected to the services of physicians at times of serious illness,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> specialists were summoned. Amidst the frantic rush of ministering
to the stricken man, I was deeply praying to Lahiri Mahasaya for
help. I hurried to his home and sobbed out the story.

"'The doctors are seeing Rama. He will be well.' My guru smiled
jovially.

"I returned with a <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t16 t19 t22 t23 t25 t26 hoverable">heart</span> to my friend's bedside, only to find

him in a dying state.

"'He <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">cannot</span> last more than <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> hours,' <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of the physicians
told me with a gesture of despair. Once more I hastened to Lahiri
Mahasaya.

"'The doctors are conscientious men. I am sure Rama will be well.'
The <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">master</span> dismissed me blithely.

"At Rama's <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> I <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> both doctors gone. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">One</span> had left me a note:
'We have done our best, but his case is hopeless.'

"My friend was indeed the picture of a dying man. I did not understand
how Lahiri Mahasaya's <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">words</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> fail to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> true, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> the sight
of Rama's rapidly ebbing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> kept suggesting to my mind: 'All is
over now.' Tossing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> on the seas of faith and apprehensive doubt,
I ministered to my friend as best I could. He roused himself to
cry out:

"'Yukteswar, run to <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> and tell him I am gone. Ask him to
bless my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> before its last rites.' With these <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">words</span> Rama sighed
heavily and gave up the ghost. {FN32-2}

"I wept for an hour by his beloved form. Always a lover of quiet,
now he had attained the utter stillness of death. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Another</span> disciple

came in; I asked him to remain in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> until I returned.
Half-dazed, I trudged back to my guru.

"'How is Rama now?' Lahiri Mahasaya's face was wreathed in smiles.

"'Sir, you will soon <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> how he is,' I blurted out emotionally.
'In a few hours you will <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> his body, before it is carried to the
crematory grounds.' I broke down and moaned openly.

"'Yukteswar, control yourself. Sit calmly and meditate.' My guru
retired into SAMADHI. The afternoon and night passed in unbroken
silence; I struggled unsuccessfully to regain an inner composure.

"At dawn Lahiri Mahasaya glanced at me consolingly. 'I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> you are
still disturbed. Why didn't you explain yesterday that you expected
me to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> Rama tangible aid in the <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of some medicine?' The
<span class="t6 t18 hoverable">master</span> pointed to a cup-shaped lamp containing crude castor oil.
'Fill a little bottle from the lamp; <span class="t0 t2 t16 t18 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">put</span> seven drops into Rama's
mouth.'

"'Sir,' I remonstrated, 'he has been dead since yesterday noon. Of
what use is the oil now?'

"'Never mind; just do as I ask.' Lahiri Mahasaya's cheerful
mood was incomprehensible; I was still in the unassuaged agony of

bereavement. Pouring out a small amount of oil, I departed for
Rama's house.

"I <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> my friend's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> rigid in the death-clasp. Paying no
attention to his ghastly condition, I opened his lips with my <span class="t27 hoverable">right</span>
finger and managed, with my left <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t29 hoverable">hand</span> and the help of the cork, to
<span class="t0 t2 t16 t18 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">put</span> the oil drop by drop over his clenched teeth.

"As the seventh drop touched his cold lips, Rama shivered violently.
His muscles vibrated from head to foot as he sat up wonderingly.

"'I saw Lahiri Mahasaya in a blaze of light,' he cried. 'He shone
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> the sun. 'Arise; forsake your sleep,' he commanded me. 'Come
with Yukteswar to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> me.'"

"I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> scarcely believe my eyes when Rama dressed himself and
was strong enough after that fatal sickness to walk to the home of
our guru. There he prostrated himself before Lahiri Mahasaya with
tears of gratitude.

"The <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">master</span> was beside himself with mirth. His eyes twinkled at me
mischievously.

"'Yukteswar,' he said, 'surely henceforth you will not fail to
carry with you a bottle of castor oil! Whenever you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> a corpse,

just administer the oil! Why, seven drops of lamp oil <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> surely
foil the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of Yama!' {FN32-3}

"'Guruji, you are ridiculing me. I don't understand; please point
out the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of my error.'

"'I told you twice that Rama <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be well; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> not fully
believe me,' Lahiri Mahasaya explained. 'I did not mean the doctors
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be able to cure him; I remarked only that they were in
attendance. There was no causal connection between my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> statements.
I didn't want to interfere with the physicians; they have to live,
too.' In a voice resounding with joy, my guru added, 'Always <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">know</span>
that the inexhaustible Paramatman {FN32-4} can heal anyone, doctor
or no doctor.'

"'I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> my mistake,' I acknowledged remorsefully. 'I <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">know</span> now that

As Sri Yukteswar finished the awesome story, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of the spellbound
listeners ventured a question that, from a child, was doubly
understandable.

"Sir," he said, "why did your guru use castor oil?"

"Child, giving the oil had no <span class="t6 t13 t14 t25 t27 hoverable">meaning</span> except that I expected

something material and Lahiri Mahasaya chose the near-by oil as an
objective symbol for awakening my greater faith. The <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">master</span> allowed
Rama to die, because I had partially doubted. But the <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> guru
knew that inasmuch as he had <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> the disciple <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be well, the

a disease usually final!"

placed it in a <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> temple, now well-known as the Ghurni Shiva Site.

Gaur Mohan Lahiri and his family left Nadia and became residents
of Benares, where the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t28 hoverable">father</span> immediately erected a Shiva temple. He
conducted his household along the lines of Vedic discipline, with
regular observance of ceremonial worship, acts of charity, and
scriptural study. Just and open-minded, however, he did not ignore
the beneficial current of modern ideas.

The boy Lahiri <span class="t4 hoverable">took</span> lessons in Hindi and Urdu in Benares study-groups.
He attended a school conducted by Joy Narayan Ghosal, receiving

instruction in Sanskrit, Bengali, French, and English. Applying
himself to a close study of the VEDAS, the young yogi listened
eagerly to scriptural discussions by learned Brahmins, including
a Marhatta pundit named Nag-Bhatta.

Shyama Charan was a kind, gentle, and courageous youth, beloved by
all his companions. With a well-proportioned, bright, and powerful
body, he excelled in swimming and in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> skillful activities.

In 1846 Shyama Charan Lahiri was married to Srimati Kashi Moni,
daughter of Sri Debnarayan Sanyal. A model Indian housewife, Kashi
Moni cheerfully carried on her home duties and the traditional
householder's obligation to serve guests and the poor. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Two</span> saintly
sons, Tincouri and Ducouri, blessed the union.

At the age of 23, in 1851, Lahiri Mahasaya <span class="t4 hoverable">took</span> the post of accountant
in the Military Engineering Department of the English government.
He received <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> promotions during the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of his service. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span>
not only was he a <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">master</span> before God's eyes, but <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> a success in
the little <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> drama where he played his <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> role as an office
worker in the world.

As the offices of the Army Department were shifted, Lahiri Mahasaya
was transferred to Gazipur, Mirjapur, Danapur, Naini Tal, Benares,
and other localities. After the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> of his father, Lahiri had to

assume the entire responsibility of his family, for whom he bought
a quiet residence in the Garudeswar Mohulla neighborhood of Benares.

It was in his thirty-third year that Lahiri Mahasaya saw fulfillment
of the purpose for which he had been reincarnated on earth.
The ash-hidden flame, <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> smouldering, received its opportunity
to burst into flame. A <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> decree, resting beyond the gaze of

near Ranikhet, and was initiated by him into KRIYA YOGA.

This auspicious event did not happen to him alone; it was a
fortunate moment for all the <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> race, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> of whom were later

CHAPTER: 33

BABAJI, THE YOGI-CHRIST OF MODERN INDIA

The northern Himalayan crags near Badrinarayan are still blessed by
the living presence of Babaji, guru of Lahiri Mahasaya. The secluded

master has retained his physical <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> for centuries, perhaps for
millenniums. The deathless Babaji is an AVATARA. This Sanskrit <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">word</span>
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t14 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">means</span> "descent"; its roots are AVA, "down," and TRI, "to pass."
In the Hindu scriptures, AVATARA signifies the descent of Divinity
into flesh.

"Babaji's <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> state is beyond <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> comprehension," Sri
Yukteswar explained to me. "The dwarfed vision of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">cannot</span> pierce
to his transcendental star. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">One</span> attempts in vain <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> to picture
the avatar's attainment. It is inconceivable."

The UPANISHADS have minutely classified <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> stage of <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span>
advancement. A SIDDHA ("perfected being") has progressed from the
state of a JIVANMUKTA ("freed while living") to that of a PARAMUKTA
("supremely free"-full <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> over death); the latter has completely
escaped from the mayic thralldom and its reincarnational round. The
PARAMUKTA <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> seldom returns to a physical body; if he does,
he is an avatar, a divinely appointed medium of supernal blessings
on the world.

An avatar is unsubject to the universal economy; his pure body,
visible as a <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> image, is free from any debt to nature. The
casual gaze <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> <span class="t15 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">nothing</span> extraordinary in an avatar's <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> but
it casts no shadow nor makes any footprint on the ground. These are
outward symbolic proofs of an inward lack of darkness and material

bondage. Such a God-man alone knows the <span class="t3 t7 t9 t10 t15 t19 t22 hoverable">Truth</span> behind the relativities
of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> and death. Omar Khayyam, so grossly misunderstood, sang of
this liberated <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> in his immortal scripture, the RUBAIYAT:

"Ah, Moon of my Delight who know'st no wane,
The Moon of Heav'n is rising once again;
How oft hereafter rising <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> she look
Through this same Garden after me-in vain!"

The "Moon of Delight" is God, eternal Polaris, anachronous never.
The "Moon of Heav'n" is the outward cosmos, fettered to the <span class="t0 t8 t12 t15 t19 t23 t25 hoverable">law</span> of
periodic recurrence. Its chains had been dissolved forever by the
Persian seer through his self-realization. "How oft hereafter rising

by a frantic universe for an absolute omission!

<span class="t3 t7 t12 t17 t19 t24 t26 hoverable">Christ</span> expressed his freedom in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">another</span> way: "And a <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> scribe

Babaji's mission in India has been to assist prophets in carrying
out their special dispensations. He <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> qualifies for the scriptural
classification of MAHAVATAR (Great Avatar). He has stated that
he gave yoga initiation to Shankara, ancient founder of the Swami
Order, and to Kabir, famous medieval saint. His chief nineteenth-century
disciple was, as we know, Lahiri Mahasaya, revivalist of the lost
KRIYA art.

us. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> guru has <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> openly appeared in any century; the

with the slow evolutionary progress of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> during the centuries

veil themselves from the gross public gaze, and have the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span>
to <span class="t8 t13 hoverable">become</span> invisible at will. For these reasons, and because they
generally instruct their disciples to maintain silence about them, a
number of towering <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> figures remain world-unknown. I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span>
in these pages on Babaji merely a hint of his life-only a few facts
which he deems it fit and helpful to be publicly imparted.

No limiting facts about Babaji's family or birthplace, dear to the
annalist's heart, have <span class="t29 hoverable">ever</span> been discovered. His speech is generally
in Hindi, but he converses easily in any language. He has adopted

the simple <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> of Babaji (revered father); other titles of respect

(supreme ecstatic saint), Maha Yogi (greatest of yogis), Trambak
Baba and Shiva Baba (titles of avatars of Shiva). Does it matter
that we <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">know</span> not the patronymic of an earth-released master?

"Whenever anyone utters with reverence the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> of Babaji," Lahiri
Mahasaya said, "that devotee attracts an instant <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> blessing."

The deathless guru bears no marks of age on his body; he appears to
be no more than a youth of twenty-five. Fair-skinned, of medium build
and height, Babaji's beautiful, strong <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> radiates a perceptible
glow. His eyes are dark, calm, and tender; his long, lustrous
hair is copper-colored. A very strange fact is that Babaji bears an
extraordinarily exact resemblance to his disciple Lahiri Mahasaya.
The similarity is so striking that, in his later years, Lahiri
Mahasaya <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t18 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">might</span> have passed as the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t28 hoverable">father</span> of the youthful-looking
Babaji.

Swami Kebalananda, my saintly Sanskrit tutor, spent some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> with
Babaji in the Himalayas.

"The peerless <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">master</span> moves with his group from <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> to <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> in
the mountains," Kebalananda told me. "His small band contains <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span>
highly advanced American disciples. After Babaji has been in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span>

locality for some time, he says: 'DERA DANDA UTHAO.' ('Let us lift
our camp and staff.') He carries a symbolic DANDA (bamboo staff).
His <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">words</span> are the signal for moving with his group instantaneously

travel; sometimes he goes on foot from peak to peak.

"Babaji can be seen or recognized by <span class="t1 t7 t13 hoverable">others</span> only when he so
desires. He is <span class="t6 t10 t15 hoverable">known</span> to have appeared in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> slightly <span class="t1 t2 t18 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">different</span>
forms to various devotees-sometimes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> beard and moustache,
and sometimes with them. As his undecaying <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> requires no food,
the <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">master</span> seldom eats. As a social courtesy to visiting disciples,
he occasionally accepts fruits, or rice cooked in milk and clarified
butter.

"Two amazing incidents of Babaji's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> are <span class="t6 t10 t15 hoverable">known</span> to me," Kebalananda
<span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> on. "His disciples were sitting <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> night around a huge <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span>
which was blazing for a sacred Vedic ceremony. The <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">master</span> suddenly
seized a burning log and lightly struck the bare shoulder of a
chela who was close to the fire.

"'Sir, how cruel!' Lahiri Mahasaya, who was present, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> this
remonstrance.

"'Would you rather have seen him burned to ashes before your eyes,

"With these <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">words</span> Babaji placed his healing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t29 hoverable">hand</span> on the chela's
disfigured shoulder. 'I have freed you tonight from painful death.
The karmic <span class="t0 t8 t12 t15 t19 t23 t25 hoverable">law</span> has been satisfied through your slight suffering by
fire.'

"On <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">another</span> occasion Babaji's sacred circle was disturbed by the
arrival of a stranger. He had climbed with astonishing skill to
the nearly inaccessible ledge near the camp of the master.

"'Sir, you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> be the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Babaji.' The man's face was lit with
inexpressible reverence. 'For months I have pursued a ceaseless
search for you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span> these forbidding crags. I implore you to accept
me as a disciple.'

"When the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> guru <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> no response, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> pointed to the rocky
chasm at his feet.

"'If you refuse me, I will jump from this mountain. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Life</span> has no

"'Jump then,' Babaji <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> unemotionally.

your present state of development.'

"The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> immediately hurled himself over the cliff. Babaji instructed

the shocked disciples to fetch the stranger's body. When they
returned with the mangled form, the <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">master</span> placed his <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t29 hoverable">hand</span>
on the dead man. Lo! he opened his eyes and prostrated himself
humbly before the omnipotent one.

"'You are now ready for discipleship.' Babaji beamed lovingly on
his resurrected chela. 'You have courageously passed a difficult
test. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">Death</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> not touch you again; now you are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of our
immortal flock.' Then he spoke his usual <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">words</span> of departure, 'DERA
DANDA UTHAO'; the <span class="t3 t5 t7 t9 t20 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> group vanished from the mountain."

An avatar lives in the omnipresent Spirit; for him there is no
distance inverse to the square. Only <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> reason, therefore, can
motivate Babaji in maintaining his physical <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> from century to
century: the desire to furnish humanity with a concrete example
of its own possibilities. Were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> vouchsafed a glimpse of

delusion that he <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">cannot</span> transcend his mortality.

<span class="t4 t17 t22 hoverable">Jesus</span> knew from the beginning the sequence of his life; he passed
through each event not for himself, not from any karmic compulsion,
but solely for the upliftment of reflective <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> beings. His
four reporter-disciples-Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John-recorded the
ineffable drama for the benefit of later generations.

For Babaji, also, there is no relativity of past, present, future;
from the beginning he has <span class="t6 t10 t15 hoverable">known</span> all phases of his life. Yet,
accommodating himself to the limited understanding of men, he has
played <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> acts of his <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> in the presence of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> or more

the possibility of bodily immortality. He uttered this promise

{FN33-2} During my visit at Ranbajpur with Ram Gopal, "the sleepless
saint," {FN33-3} he related the wondrous story of his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> meeting
with Babaji.

"I sometimes left my isolated cave to sit at Lahiri Mahasaya's feet
in Benares," Ram Gopal told me. "One midnight as I was silently
meditating in a group of his disciples, the <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">master</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> a surprising
request.

"'Ram Gopal,' he said, 'go at once to the Dasasamedh bathing GHAT.'

"I soon reached the secluded spot. The night was bright with moonlight

and the glittering stars. After I had sat in patient silence for
awhile, my attention was drawn to a huge stone slab near my feet.
It rose gradually, revealing an underground cave. As the stone
remained balanced in some unknown manner, the draped <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of
a young and surpassingly lovely woman was levitated from the cave
high into the air. Surrounded by a soft halo, she slowly descended
in front of me and stood motionless, steeped in an inner state of
ecstasy. She finally stirred, and spoke gently.

"'I am Mataji, {FN33-4} the sister of Babaji. I have asked him and
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> Lahiri Mahasaya to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> to my cave tonight to discuss a matter
of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> importance.'

"A nebulous <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> was rapidly floating over the Ganges; the strange
luminescence was reflected in the opaque waters. It approached
nearer and nearer until, with a blinding flash, it appeared by the
side of Mataji and condensed itself instantly into the <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span>
of Lahiri Mahasaya. He bowed humbly at the feet of the woman saint.

"Before I had recovered from my bewilderment, I was further
wonderstruck to <span class="t0 t5 t16 t22 hoverable">behold</span> a circling mass of mystical <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> traveling
in the sky. Descending swiftly, the flaming whirlpool neared our
group and materialized itself into the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> of a beautiful youth who,
I understood at once, was Babaji. He looked <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> Lahiri Mahasaya,
the only difference being that Babaji appeared <span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">much</span> younger, and

had long, bright hair.

"Lahiri Mahasaya, Mataji, and myself knelt at the guru's feet. An
ethereal sensation of beatific glory thrilled <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> fiber of my
being as I touched his <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> flesh.

"'Blessed sister,' Babaji said, 'I am intending to shed my <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span>
and plunge into the Infinite Current.'

"'I have already glimpsed your plan, beloved master. I wanted to
discuss it with you tonight. Why should you leave your body?' The
glorious woman looked at him beseechingly.

"'What is the difference if I wear a visible or invisible wave on
the ocean of my Spirit?'

"Mataji replied with a quaint flash of wit. 'Deathless guru, if it
makes no difference, then please do not <span class="t29 hoverable">ever</span> relinquish your form.'
{FN33-5}

"'Be it so,' Babaji <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> solemnly. 'I will <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> leave my physical
body. It will always remain visible to at least a small number of
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> on this earth.

lips.'

"As I listened in awe to the conversation between these exalted
beings, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> guru turned to me with a benign gesture.

"'Fear not, Ram Gopal,' he said, 'you are blessed to be a witness
at the scene of this immortal promise.'

"As the sweet melody of Babaji's voice faded away, his <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> and
that of Lahiri Mahasaya slowly levitated and moved backward over
the Ganges. An aureole of dazzling <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> templed their bodies as
they vanished into the night sky. Mataji's <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> floated to the cave
and descended; the stone slab closed of itself, as if working on
an invisible leverage.

"Infinitely inspired, I wended my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> back to Lahiri Mahasaya's
place. As I bowed before him in the early dawn, my guru smiled at
me understandingly.

"'I am happy for you, Ram Gopal,' he said. 'The desire of meeting
Babaji and Mataji, which you have often expressed to me, has <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span>
at last a sacred fulfillment.'

"My fellow disciples informed me that Lahiri Mahasaya had not moved
from his dais since early the preceding evening.

"'He gave a wonderful discourse on immortality after you had left

for the Dasasamedh GHAT,' <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of the chelas told me.

"Lahiri Mahasaya later explained to me <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> metaphysical points

concluded.

MATERIALIZING A PALACE IN THE HIMALAYAS

"Babaji's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> meeting with Lahiri Mahasaya is an enthralling

Lahiri Mahasaya had said. "In the autumn of 1861 I was stationed
in Danapur as a government accountant in the Military Engineering
Department. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">One</span> morning the office manager summoned me.

During a ramble <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> early afternoon, I was astounded to
hear a distant voice calling my name. I continued my vigorous upward
climb on Drongiri Mountain. A slight uneasiness beset me at the
<span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> that I <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t18 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">might</span> not be able to retrace my steps before darkness
had descended over the jungle.

"I finally reached a small clearing <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whose</span> sides were dotted
with caves. On <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of the rocky ledges stood a smiling young man,

extending his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t29 hoverable">hand</span> in welcome. I noticed with astonishment that,
except for his copper-colored hair, he bore a remarkable resemblance
to myself.

"'Lahiri, you have come!' The saint addressed me affectionately in
Hindi. 'Rest here in this cave. It was I who <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> you.'

"I entered a neat little grotto which contained several woolen
blankets and a few KAMANDULUS (begging bowls).

"'Lahiri, do you remember that seat?' The yogi pointed to a folded
blanket in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> corner.

"'No, sir.' Somewhat dazed at the strangeness of my adventure, I
added, 'I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> leave now, before nightfall. I have business in the
morning at my office.'

"The mysterious saint replied in English, 'The office was <span class="t2 t4 t5 t22 t23 hoverable">brought</span>
for you, and not you for the office.'

"I was dumbfounded that this forest ascetic should not only speak
English but <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> paraphrase the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">words</span> of Christ. {FN34-3}

"'I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> my telegram <span class="t4 hoverable">took</span> effect.' The yogi's remark was incomprehensible
to me; I inquired his meaning.

"'I refer to the telegram that summoned you to these isolated parts.
It was I who silently suggested to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> of your superior officer
that you be transferred to Ranikhet. When <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> feels his unity with
mankind, all minds <span class="t8 t13 hoverable">become</span> transmitting stations through which he
can <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t7 t10 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> at will.' He added gently, 'Lahiri, surely this cave seems
familiar to you?'

"As I maintained a bewildered silence, the saint approached and
struck me gently on the forehead. At his magnetic touch, a wondrous
current swept through my brain, releasing the sweet seed-memories
of my previous life.

"'I remember!' My voice was half-choked with joyous sobs. 'You are
my guru Babaji, who has belonged to me always! Scenes of the past
arise vividly in my mind; here in this cave I spent <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span> of
my last incarnation!' As ineffable recollections overwhelmed me,
I tearfully embraced my master's feet.

"'For more than <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> decades I have waited for you here-waited
for you to return to me!' Babaji's voice rang with celestial love.
'You slipped <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">away</span> and vanished into the tumultuous waves of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span>
beyond death. The magic wand of your karma touched you, and you
were gone! <span class="t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Though</span> you lost sight of me, <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> did I lose sight
of you! I pursued you over the luminescent astral sea where the

glorious angels sail. Through gloom, storm, upheaval, and <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> I
followed you, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> a mother bird guarding her young. As you lived
out your <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> term of womb-life, and emerged a babe, my eye was
<span class="t29 hoverable">ever</span> on you. When you covered your tiny <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> in the lotus posture
under the Nadia sands in your childhood, I was invisibly present!
Patiently, month after month, year after year, I have watched over
you, waiting for this perfect day. Now you are with me! Lo, here
is your cave, loved of yore! I have kept it <span class="t29 hoverable">ever</span> clean and ready
for you. Here is your hallowed ASANA-blanket, where you daily sat
to fill your expanding <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t16 t19 t22 t23 t25 t26 hoverable">heart</span> with God! <span class="t0 t5 t16 t22 hoverable">Behold</span> there your bowl, from
which you often drank the nectar prepared by me! <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">See</span> how I have
kept the brass cup brightly polished, that you <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t18 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">might</span> drink again
therefrom! My own, do you now understand?'

"'My guru, what can I say?' I murmured brokenly. 'Where has <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span>
<span class="t29 hoverable">ever</span> heard of such deathless love?' I gazed <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> and ecstatically
on my eternal treasure, my guru in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> and death.

"'Lahiri, you need purification. Drink the oil in this bowl and lie
down by the river.' Babaji's practical wisdom, I reflected with a
quick, reminiscent smile, was <span class="t29 hoverable">ever</span> to the fore.

"I obeyed his directions. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Though</span> the icy Himalayan night was descending,
a comforting warmth, an inner radiation, began to pulsate in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span>
cell of my body. I marveled. Was the unknown oil endued with a

cosmical heat?

"Bitter winds whipped around me in the darkness, shrieking a fierce
challenge. The chill wavelets of the Gogash River lapped now and
then over my body, outstretched on the rocky bank. Tigers howled
near-by, but my <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t16 t19 t22 t23 t25 t26 hoverable">heart</span> was free of fear; the radiant force newly
generated <span class="t5 t7 hoverable">within</span> me conveyed an assurance of unassailable protection.
Several hours passed swiftly; faded memories of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">another</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> wove
themselves into the present brilliant pattern of reunion with my
<span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> guru.

"My solitary musings were interrupted by the sound of approaching
footsteps. In the darkness, a man's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t29 hoverable">hand</span> gently helped me to my
feet, and gave me some dry clothing.

"'Come, brother,' my companion said. 'The <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">master</span> awaits you.'

"He led the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> through the forest. The somber night was suddenly
lit by a steady luminosity in the distance.

"'Can that be the sunrise?' I inquired. 'Surely the <span class="t3 t5 t7 t9 t20 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> night
has not passed?'

"'The hour is midnight.' My guide laughed softly. 'Yonder <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span>
is the glow of a golden palace, materialized here tonight by the

peerless Babaji. In the dim past, you once expressed a desire to
enjoy the beauties of a palace. Our <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">master</span> is now satisfying your
wish, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> freeing you from the bonds of karma.' {FN34-4} He added,
'The magnificent palace will be the scene of your initiation tonight
into KRIYA YOGA. All your brothers here join in a paean of welcome,
rejoicing at the <span class="t7 t10 t15 t25 hoverable">end</span> of your <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> exile. Behold!'

"A vast palace of dazzling gold stood before us. Studded with
countless jewels, and <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t15 t17 t18 t19 hoverable">set</span> amidst landscaped gardens, it presented
a spectacle of unparalleled grandeur. Saints of angelic countenance
were stationed by resplendent gates, half-reddened by the glitter
of rubies. Diamonds, pearls, sapphires, and emeralds of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> size
and luster were imbedded in the decorative arches.

"I followed my companion into a spacious reception hall. The odor
of incense and of roses wafted through the air; dim lamps shed
a multicolored glow. Small groups of devotees, some fair, some
dark-skinned, chanted musically, or sat in the meditative posture,
immersed in an inner peace. A vibrant joy pervaded the atmosphere.

"'Feast your eyes; enjoy the artistic splendors of this palace,
for it has been <span class="t2 t4 t5 t22 t23 hoverable">brought</span> into being solely in your honor.' My guide
smiled sympathetically as I uttered a few ejaculations of wonderment.

"'Brother,' I said, 'the beauty of this structure surpasses the

bounds of <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> imagination. Please tell me the mystery of its
origin.'

"'I will gladly enlighten you.' My companion's dark eyes sparkled
with wisdom. 'In reality there is <span class="t15 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">nothing</span> inexplicable about this
materialization. The <span class="t3 t5 t7 t9 t20 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> cosmos is a materialized <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> of the
Creator. This heavy, earthly clod, floating in space, is a dream
of God. He <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> out of His consciousness, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span>
in his dream consciousness reproduces and vivifies a <span class="t14 hoverable">creation</span> with
its creatures.

"'God <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> created the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> as an idea.

solid sphere. All its molecules are held <span class="t16 t21 hoverable">together</span> by the will of
God. When He withdraws His will, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> again will disintegrate
into energy. Energy will dissolve into consciousness; the earth-idea
will disappear from objectivity.

"'The substance of a dream is held in materialization by the
subconscious <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> of the dreamer. When that cohesive <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span>
is withdrawn in wakefulness, the dream and its elements dissolve.
A <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> closes his eyes and erects a dream-creation which, on awakening,
he effortlessly dematerializes. He follows the <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> archetypal
pattern. Similarly, when he awakens in cosmic consciousness, he
will effortlessly dematerialize the illusions of the cosmic dream.

was blazing with diamonds. 'Our <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> guru created this palace by
solidifying myriads of free cosmic rays,' he <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> on. 'Touch this
vase and its diamonds; they will satisfy all the tests of sensory
experience.'

"I examined the vase, and passed my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t29 hoverable">hand</span> over the smooth room-walls,
thick with glistening gold. Each of the jewels scattered lavishly
about was worthy of a king's collection. Deep satisfaction spread
over my mind. A submerged desire, hidden in my subconsciousness
from lives now gone, seemed simultaneously gratified and extinguished.

"My stately companion led me through ornate arches and corridors
into a <span class="t14 hoverable">series</span> of chambers richly furnished in the style of an
emperor's palace. We entered an immense hall. In the center stood
a golden throne, encrusted with jewels shedding a dazzling medley
of colors. There, in lotus posture, sat the supreme Babaji. I
knelt on the shining floor at his feet.

"'Lahiri, are you still feasting on your dream desires for a golden
palace?' My guru's eyes were twinkling <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> his own sapphires.
'Wake! All your earthly thirsts are about to be quenched forever.'
He murmured some mystic <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">words</span> of blessing. 'My son, arise. Receive
your initiation into the kingdom of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> through KRIYA YOGA.'

"Babaji stretched out his hand; a HOMA (sacrificial) <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> appeared,
surrounded by fruits and flowers. I received the liberating yogic
technique before this flaming altar.

"The rites were completed in the early dawn. I felt no need for
sleep in my ecstatic state, and wandered around the palace, filled

on all sides with treasures and priceless OBJETS D'ART. Descending
to the gorgeous gardens, I noticed, near-by, the same caves and
barren mountain ledges which yesterday had boasted no adjacency to
palace or flowered terrace.

"Reentering the palace, fabulously glistening in the cold Himalayan
sunlight, I sought the presence of my master. He was still enthroned,
surrounded by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> quiet disciples.

"'Lahiri, you are hungry.' Babaji added, 'Close your eyes.'

"When I reopened them, the enchanting palace and its picturesque
gardens had disappeared. My own <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> and the forms of Babaji
and the cluster of chelas were all now seated on the bare ground
at the exact site of the vanished palace, not <span class="t6 t9 t18 t26 hoverable">far</span> from the sunlit
entrances of the rocky grottos. I recalled that my guide had remarked
that the palace <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be dematerialized, its captive atoms released
into the thought-essence from which it had sprung. Although stunned,
I looked trustingly at my guru. I knew not what to expect next on
this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> of miracles.

"'The purpose for which the palace was created has now been served,'
Babaji explained. He lifted an earthen vessel from the ground. 'Put
your <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t29 hoverable">hand</span> there and receive whatever food you desire.'

"As soon as I touched the broad, empty bowl, it became heaped
with hot butter-fried LUCHIS, curry, and rare sweetmeats. I helped
myself, observing that the vessel was ever-filled. At the <span class="t7 t10 t15 t25 hoverable">end</span> of my
meal I looked around for water. My guru pointed to the bowl before
me. Lo! the food had vanished; in its <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> was water, clear as
from a mountain stream.

"'Few mortals <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">know</span> that the kingdom of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> includes the kingdom of
mundane fulfillments,' Babaji observed. 'The <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> realm extends
to the earthly, but the latter, being illusory, <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">cannot</span> include the
essence of reality.'

"'Beloved guru, last night you demonstrated for me the link of
beauty in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t15 t18 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heaven</span> and earth!' I smiled at memories of the vanished
palace; surely no simple yogi had <span class="t29 hoverable">ever</span> received initiation into the
august mysteries of <span class="t0 t1 t3 t5 t7 t8 t13 t16 t18 t20 t21 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">Spirit</span> amidst surroundings of more impressive
luxury! I gazed tranquilly at the stark contrast of the present
scene. The gaunt ground, the skyey roof, the caves offering primitive
shelter-all seemed a gracious natural setting for the seraphic
saints around me.

"I sat that afternoon on my blanket, hallowed by associations of
past-life realizations. My <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> guru approached and passed his
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t29 hoverable">hand</span> over my head. I entered the NIRBIKALPA SAMADHI state, remaining
unbrokenly in its bliss for seven days. Crossing the successive

strata of self-knowledge, I penetrated the deathless realms of
reality. All delusive limitations dropped away; my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> was fully
established on the eternal altar of the Cosmic Spirit. On the eighth

near him in this sacred wilderness.

"'My son,' Babaji said, embracing me, 'your role in this incarnation

"How remote seemed my family, the office, the world, as I listened
to my guru in the high Himalayan solitudes. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> adamantine <span class="t3 t7 t9 t10 t15 t19 t22 hoverable">truth</span>
rang in his words; I submissively agreed to leave this blessed
haven of peace. Babaji instructed me in the ancient rigid rules
which govern the transmission of the yogic art from guru to disciple.

"'Bestow the KRIYA key only on qualified chelas,' Babaji said.
'He who vows to <span class="t27 hoverable">sacrifice</span> all in the quest of the <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> is fit to

"'Angelic guru, as you have already favored mankind by resurrecting
the lost KRIYA art, will you not increase that benefit by relaxing
the strict requirements for discipleship?' I gazed beseechingly
at Babaji. 'I pray that you permit me to communicate KRIYA to all
seekers, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> at <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> they <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">cannot</span> vow themselves to complete

"'Be it so. The <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> wish has been expressed through you.' With
these simple words, the merciful guru banished the rigorous safeguards
that for ages had hidden KRIYA from the world. 'Give KRIYA freely
to all who humbly ask for help.'

"After a silence, Babaji added, 'Repeat to each of your disciples
this majestic promise from the BHAGAVAD GITA: "SWALPAMASYA DHARMASYA,
TRAYATA MAHATO BHOYAT"--"Even a little bit of the practice of this
religion will save you from dire fears and colossal sufferings."'
{FN34-8}

"As I knelt the next morning at my guru's feet for his farewell
blessing, he sensed my deep reluctance to leave him.

"'There is no separation for us, my beloved child.' He touched my
shoulder affectionately. 'Wherever you are, whenever you call me,
I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> be with you instantly.'

"Consoled by his wondrous promise, and rich with the newly <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> gold
of God-wisdom, I wended my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> down the mountain. At the office I

was welcomed by my fellow employees, who for ten <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t11 t20 t26 t27 hoverable">days</span> had <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span>
me lost in the Himalayan jungles. A letter soon arrived from the
head office.

"'Lahiri should return to the Danapur {FN34-9} office,' it read.
'His transfer to Ranikhet occurred by error. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Another</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> should
have been sent to assume the Ranikhet duties.'

"I smiled, reflecting on the hidden crosscurrents in the events
which had led me to this furthermost spot of India.

"Before returning to Danapur, I spent a few <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t11 t20 t26 t27 hoverable">days</span> with a Bengali
family at Moradabad. A party of six friends gathered to greet me.
As I turned the conversation to <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> subjects, my host observed
gloomily:

"'Oh, in these <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t11 t20 t26 t27 hoverable">days</span> India is destitute of saints!'

"'Babu,' I protested warmly, 'of course there are still <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>
masters in this land!'

"In a mood of exalted fervor, I felt impelled to relate my miraculous

incredulous.

"Burning with the enthusiasm of truth, I spoke <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> due thought.
'If I call him, my guru will appear <span class="t27 hoverable">right</span> in this house.'

"Interest gleamed in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> eye; it was no wonder that the group
was eager to <span class="t0 t5 t16 t22 hoverable">behold</span> a saint materialized in such a strange way.
Half-reluctantly, I asked for a quiet room and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> woolen

"'The <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">master</span> will materialize from the ether,' I said. 'Remain
silently outside the door; I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> soon call you.'

"I sank into the meditative state, humbly summoning my guru. The
darkened room soon filled with a dim aural moonlight; the luminous
figure of Babaji emerged.

"'Lahiri, do you call me for a trifle?' The master's gaze was stern.
'Truth is for earnest seekers, not for those of idle curiosity. It
is easy to believe when <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> sees; there is <span class="t15 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">nothing</span> then to deny.
Supersensual <span class="t3 t7 t9 t10 t15 t19 t22 hoverable">truth</span> is deserved and discovered by those who overcome
their natural materialistic skepticism.' He added gravely, 'Let me
go!'

"I fell entreatingly at his feet. 'Holy guru, I realize my serious
error; I humbly ask pardon. It was to create faith in these
spiritually blinded minds that I ventured to call you. Because you
have graciously appeared at my prayer, please do not depart <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span>

at least they were willing to investigate the <span class="t3 t7 t9 t10 t15 t19 t22 hoverable">truth</span> of my strange
assertions.'

"'Very well; I will stay awhile. I do not wish your <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">word</span> discredited
before your friends.' Babaji's face had softened, but he added
gently, 'Henceforth, my son, I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> when you need me, and
not always when you call me. {FN34-10}'

"Tense silence reigned in the little group when I opened the door.
As if mistrusting their senses, my friends stared at the lustrous
figure on the blanket seat.

"'This is mass-hypnotism!' <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">One</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> laughed blatantly.

"Babaji advanced smilingly and motioned to each <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> to touch the
warm, solid flesh of his body. Doubts dispelled, my friends prostrated
themselves on the floor in awed repentance.

"'Let HALUA {FN34-11} be prepared.' Babaji <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> this request,

was the metamorphosis of these doubting Thomases into devout St.
Pauls. After we had eaten, Babaji blessed each of us in turn. There
was a sudden flash; we witnessed the instantaneous dechemicalization
of the electronic elements of Babaji's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> into a spreading vaporous
light. The God-tuned will <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of the <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">master</span> had loosened its
grasp of the ether atoms held <span class="t16 t21 hoverable">together</span> as his body; forthwith the
trillions of tiny lifetronic sparks faded into the infinite reservoir.

"'With my own eyes I have seen the conqueror of death.' Maitra,

"The scene was a KUMBHA MELA at Allahabad," Lahiri Mahasaya told

his disciples. "I had gone there during a short vacation from my

who had <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> distances to attend the <span class="t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t12 t15 t19 t20 t23 t25 hoverable">holy</span> festival, I
noticed an ash-smeared ascetic who was holding a begging bowl. The
<span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> arose in my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> was hypocritical, wearing

grace.

"No sooner had I passed the ascetic than my astounded eye fell on
Babaji. He was kneeling in front of a matted-haired anchorite.

"'Guruji!' I hastened to his side. 'Sir, what are you doing here?'

"'I am washing the feet of this renunciate, and then I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> clean

CHAPTER: 35

THE CHRISTLIKE <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">LIFE</span> OF LAHIRI MAHASAYA

"Thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness." {FN35-1} In
these <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">words</span> to John the Baptist, and in asking John to baptize him,
<span class="t4 t17 t22 hoverable">Jesus</span> was acknowledging the <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> rights of his guru.

From a reverent study of the Bible from an Oriental viewpoint,
{FN35-2} and from intuitional perception, I am convinced that
John the Baptist was, in past lives, the guru of Christ. There are
numerous passages in the Bible which infer that John and <span class="t4 t17 t22 hoverable">Jesus</span> in
their last incarnations were, respectively, Elijah and his disciple
Elisha. (These are the spellings in the <span class="t25 hoverable">Old</span> Testament. The Greek
translators spelled the names as Elias and Eliseus; they reappear
in the <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">New</span> Testament in these changed forms.)

The very <span class="t7 t10 t15 t25 hoverable">end</span> of the <span class="t25 hoverable">Old</span> Testament is a prediction of the reincarnation
of Elijah and Elisha: "Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet

The roles became reversed, because Elijah-John was no longer needed

When <span class="t3 t7 t12 t17 t19 t24 t26 hoverable">Christ</span> was transfigured on the mountain {FN35-10} it was his
guru Elias, with Moses, whom he saw. Again, in his hour of extremity

The eternal bond of guru and disciple that existed between John and

never-severed link. Then, after their brief meeting near Ranikhet,
the selfless <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">master</span> banished his dearly-beloved disciple from the
little mountain group, releasing him for an outward <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> mission.

smiled consolingly.

"Your wife is improving; she is now writing you a letter." The
omniscient yogi quoted some parts of the missive.

"Ecstatic Babu, I already <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">know</span> that you are no ordinary man. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> I

scriptures <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> to be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> his "GITA Assembly," eagerly attended

By these manifold activities, Lahiri Mahasaya sought to answer the
common challenge: "After performing one's business and social duties,
where is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> for devotional meditation?" The harmoniously balanced

of thousands of questioning hearts. Earning only a modest salary,
thrifty, unostentatious, accessible to all, the <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">master</span> carried on
naturally and happily in the path of worldly life.

Though ensconced in the seat of the Supreme One, Lahiri Mahasaya
showed reverence to all men, irrespective of their differing
merits. When his devotees saluted him, he bowed in turn to them.
With a childlike humility, the <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">master</span> often touched the feet
of others, but seldom allowed them to pay him similar honor, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span>

and dualists, those of all faiths or of no established faith, were
impartially received and instructed by the universal guru. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">One</span> of

Through delusion you are perceiving yourself as a bundle of flesh
and bones, which at best is a nest of troubles. {FN35-12} Meditate
unceasingly, that you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> quickly <span class="t0 t5 t16 t22 hoverable">behold</span> yourself as the Infinite

Spirit."

Lahiri Mahasaya then gave his chelas liberty to express their lives
in conformance with environment and up bringing.

"A Moslem should perform his NAMAJ {FN35-13} worship four times
daily," the <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">master</span> pointed out. "Four times daily a Hindu should
sit in meditation. A Christian should go down on his knees four
times daily, praying to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> and then reading the Bible."

With wise discernment the guru guided his followers into the paths
of BHAKTI (devotion), KARMA (action), JNANA (wisdom), or RAJA (royal
or complete) YOGAS, <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">according</span> to each man's natural tendencies. The

enter the formal path of monkhood, always cautioned them to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span>

of the scriptures. "He only is wise who devotes himself to realizing,

of disciples who were listening to his exposition of the BHAGAVAD
GITA. As he was explaining the <span class="t6 t13 t14 t25 t27 hoverable">meaning</span> of KUTASTHA CHAITANYA or
the <span class="t3 t7 t12 t17 t19 t24 t26 hoverable">Christ</span> Consciousness in all vibratory creation, Lahiri Mahasaya
suddenly gasped and cried out:

"I am drowning in the bodies of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> souls off the coast of Japan!"

The next morning the chelas read a newspaper account of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span>

Japan.

The distant disciples of Lahiri Mahasaya were often <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> aware of
his enfolding presence. "I am <span class="t29 hoverable">ever</span> with those who practice KRIYA,"
he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> consolingly to chelas who <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> not remain near him. "I
will guide you to the Cosmic Home through your enlarging perceptions."

Swami Satyananda was told by a devotee that, unable to go to Benares,
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> had nevertheless received precise KRIYA initiation in a
dream. Lahiri Mahasaya had appeared to instruct the chela in answer
to his prayers.

If a disciple neglected any of his worldly obligations, the <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">master</span>
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> gently correct and discipline him.

"Lahiri Mahasaya's <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">words</span> were mild and healing, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> when he was
forced to speak openly of a chela's faults," Sri Yukteswar once
told me. He added ruefully, "No disciple <span class="t29 hoverable">ever</span> fled from our master's
barbs." I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> not help laughing, but I truthfully assured Sri
Yukteswar that, sharp or not, his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">word</span> was music to my ears.

Lahiri Mahasaya carefully graded KRIYA into four progressive
initiations. {FN35-15} He bestowed the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> higher techniques only
after the devotee had manifested definite <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> progress. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">One</span>

evaluated, gave voice to his discontent.

"Master," he said, "surely I am ready now for the <span class="t6 hoverable">second</span> initiation."

At this moment the door opened to admit a humble disciple, Brinda
Bhagat. He was a Benares postman.

"Brinda, sit by me here." The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> guru smiled at him affectionately.
"Tell me, are you ready for the <span class="t6 hoverable">second</span> technique of KRIYA?"

The little postman folded his hands in supplication. "Gurudeva," he
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> in alarm, "no more initiations, please! How can I assimilate
any higher teachings? I have <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> today to ask your blessings,

that I <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">cannot</span> deliver my letters!"

"Already Brinda swims in the sea of Spirit." At these <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">words</span> from
Lahiri Mahasaya, his other disciple hung his head.

"Master," he said, "I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> I have been a poor workman, finding fault
with my tools."

The postman, who was an uneducated man, later developed his insight
through KRIYA to such an extent that scholars occasionally sought
his interpretation on involved scriptural points. Innocent alike of
<span class="t26 hoverable">sin</span> and syntax, little Brinda won renown in the domain of learned

pundits.

Besides the numerous Benares disciples of Lahiri Mahasaya, hundreds

sought KRIYA initiation, as did the Maharaja Jotindra Mohan Thakur.

A number of Lahiri Mahasaya's disciples with influential worldly
position were desirous of expanding the KRIYA circle by publicity.
The guru refused his permission. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">One</span> chela, the royal physician

Again the guru forbade it.

"Let the fragrance of the KRIYA flower be wafted naturally, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span>

Although the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">master</span> did not adopt the system of preaching

simple guarantees of the deathless vitality of KRIYA.

In 1886, twenty-five <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span> after his Ranikhet initiation, Lahiri
Mahasaya was retired on a pension. {FN35-17} With his availability
in the daytime, disciples sought him out in ever-increasing numbers.
The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> guru now sat in silence most of the time, locked in the
tranquil lotus posture. He seldom left his little parlor, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span>
for a walk or to visit other parts of the house. A quiet stream of
chelas arrived, almost ceaselessly, for a DARSHAN (holy sight) of
the guru.

To the awe of all beholders, Lahiri Mahasaya's habitual physiological
state exhibited the superhuman features of breathlessness, sleeplessness,
cessation of pulse and heartbeat, calm eyes unblinking for hours,
and a profound aura of peace. No visitors departed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> upliftment

man of God.

The <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">master</span> now permitted his disciple, Panchanon Bhattacharya, to
open an "Arya Mission Institution" in Calcutta. Here the saintly
disciple spread the message of KRIYA YOGA, and prepared for public
benefit <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> yogic herbal {FN35-18} medicines.

In accordance with ancient custom, the <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">master</span> gave to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> in

the guru requested a disciple to distil the oil, he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> easily
accomplish the task. If anyone else tried, he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> encounter strange
difficulties, finding that the medicinal oil had almost evaporated
after going through the required distilling processes. Evidently
the master's blessing was a necessary ingredient.

prophets, Lahiri Mahasaya himself wrote no books, but his penetrating
interpretations were recorded and arranged by various disciples.
Some of these voluntary amanuenses were more discerning than <span class="t1 t7 t13 hoverable">others</span>
in correctly conveying the profound insight of the guru; yet, on
the whole, their efforts were successful. Through their zeal, the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> possesses unparalleled commentaries by Lahiri Mahasaya on
twenty-six ancient scriptures.

Sri Ananda Mohan Lahiri, a grandson of the master, has <span class="t23 hoverable">written</span> an
interesting booklet on KRIYA. "The <span class="t2 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t20 t24 t29 hoverable">text</span> of the BHAGAVAD GITA is a

knot-points (VYAS-KUTAS)," Sri Ananda wrote. "Keep those knot-points
unquestioned, and we find <span class="t15 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">nothing</span> but mythical stories of a peculiar
and easily-misunderstood type. Keep those knot-points unexplained,
and we have lost a science which the East has preserved with
superhuman patience after a quest of thousands of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span> of experiment.
{FN35-20} It was the commentaries of Lahiri Mahasaya which <span class="t2 t4 t5 t22 t23 hoverable">brought</span>
to light, clear of allegories, the very science of religion that
had been so cleverly <span class="t0 t2 t16 t18 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">put</span> out of sight in the riddle of scriptural
letters and imagery. No longer a mere unintelligible jugglery of
words, the otherwise unmeaning formulas of Vedic worship have been
proved by the <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">master</span> to be full of scientific significance. . . .

His uniqueness as a prophet lies in his practical stress on

yoga freedom to all men. Apart from the miracles of his own life,
surely the YOGAVATAR reached the zenith of all wonders in reducing
the ancient complexities of yoga to an effective simplicity not
beyond the ordinary grasp.

In reference to miracles, Lahiri Mahasaya often said, "The operation
of subtle laws which are unknown to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> in general should not

CHAPTER: 36

BABAJI'S INTEREST IN THE WEST

"Master, did you <span class="t29 hoverable">ever</span> meet Babaji?"

It was a calm summer night in Serampore; the large stars of the
tropics gleamed over our heads as I sat by Sri Yukteswar's side on
the second-story balcony of the hermitage.

"Yes." <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> smiled at my direct question; his eyes lit with
reverence. "Three times I have been blessed by the sight of the
deathless guru. Our <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> meeting was in Allahabad at a KUMBHA

"But I had already received KRIYA initiation from Lahiri Mahasaya.

slightly dazed by the clamor and surge of the crowd. In my searching
gazes around I saw no illumined face of a master. Passing a bridge

"'Oh, this fair is <span class="t15 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">nothing</span> but a chaos of noise and beggars,'
I <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> in disillusionment. 'I wonder if Western scientists,
patiently enlarging the realms of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> for the practical <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span>

profess religion but concentrate on alms.'

"My smouldering reflections on social reform were interrupted by
the voice of a tall sannyasi who halted before me.

"'Sir,' he said, 'a saint is calling you.'

"'Who is he?'

"'Come and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> for yourself.'

"Hesitantly following this laconic advice, I soon <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> myself
near a tree <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whose</span> branches were sheltering a guru with an attractive
group of disciples. The master, a bright unusual figure, with
sparkling dark eyes, rose at my approach and embraced me.

"'Welcome, Swamiji,' he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> affectionately.

"'Sir,' I replied emphatically, 'I am NOT a swami.'

"'Those on whom I am divinely directed to bestow the title
of "swami" <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> cast it off.' The saint addressed me simply, but
deep conviction of <span class="t3 t7 t9 t10 t15 t19 t22 hoverable">truth</span> rang in his words; I was engulfed in an
instant wave of <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> blessing. Smiling at my sudden elevation
into the ancient monastic order, {FN36-1} I bowed at the feet of
the obviously <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> and angelic being in <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> who had <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span>

"Babaji-for it was indeed he-motioned me to a seat near him under
the tree. He was strong and young, and looked <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> Lahiri Mahasaya;

specific <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> from arising in a person's mind. Evidently the

"'What do you think of the KUMBHA MELA?'

"'I was greatly disappointed, sir.' I added hastily, 'Up until the

"In view of my own meeting with this exalted master, I quickly
agreed with his observation.

"'Sir,' I commented, 'I have been thinking of the scientific

famous in science and philosophy, do not recognize the essential
unity in religion. Their creeds serve as insurmountable barriers
that threaten to separate them from us forever.'

"'I saw that you are interested in the West, as <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t8 t10 t12 t13 t14 t17 t19 t23 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> as the East.'
Babaji's face beamed with approval. 'I felt the pangs of your heart,
broad enough for all men, whether Oriental or Occidental. That is
why I summoned you here.

"'East and West <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> establish a golden middle path of activity

the universal methods by which the West will be able to base its
religious beliefs on the unshakable foundations of yogic science.

"'You, Swamiji, have a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> to play in the coming harmonious exchange

At this point in his story, Sri Yukteswar turned his gaze fully on
mine.

"My son," he said, smiling in the moonlight, "you are the disciple
that, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span> ago, Babaji promised to send me."

I was happy to learn that Babaji had directed my steps to Sri
Yukteswar, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> it was hard for me to visualize myself in the remote

"Babaji then spoke of the BHAGAVAD GITA," Sri Yukteswar <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> on.

was aware of the fact that I had <span class="t23 hoverable">written</span> interpretations on various

"'At my request, Swamiji, please undertake <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">another</span> task,' the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>
<span class="t6 t18 hoverable">master</span> said. 'Will you not write a short <span class="t25 hoverable">book</span> on the underlying

"'Maharaj,' {FN36-2} I answered diffidently, 'what a command! <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Shall</span>

"I deemed myself empowered by the blessings of the saint, and agreed
to write the book. Feeling reluctantly that the parting-hour had
arrived, I rose from my leafy seat.

"'Do you <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">know</span> Lahiri?' {FN36-3} the <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">master</span> inquired. 'He is a

message for Lahiri Mahasaya.

"After I had bowed humbly in farewell, the saint smiled benignly.
'When your <span class="t25 hoverable">book</span> is finished, I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> pay you a visit,' he promised.
'Good-by for the present.'

"I left Allahabad the following <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> and entrained for Benares.
Reaching my guru's home, I poured out the story of the wonderful
saint at the KUMBHA MELA.

"'Oh, didn't you recognize him?' Lahiri Mahasaya's eyes were dancing
with laughter. 'I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> you couldn't, for he prevented you. He is my

"'Gurudeva, the <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">master</span> asked me to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> you a message.

"At my utterance of these enigmatic words, Lahiri Mahasaya's figure
trembled as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> touched by a lightning current. In an instant
everything about him fell silent; his smiling countenance turned
incredibly stern. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Like</span> a wooden statue, somber and immovable in

gravity. The other disciples present stared apprehensively.

"Three hours passed in utter silence. Then Lahiri Mahasaya resumed
his natural, cheerful demeanor, and spoke affectionately to each
of the chelas. Everyone sighed in relief.

"I realized by my master's reaction that Babaji's message had been
an unmistakable signal by which Lahiri Mahasaya understood that his

His awesome silence proved that
my guru had instantly controlled his being, cut his last cord
of attachment to the material world, and fled to his ever-living
identity in Spirit. Babaji's remark had been his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> of saying:

"Though Babaji and Lahiri Mahasaya were omniscient, and had
no need of communicating with each other through me or any other
intermediary, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> ones often condescend to play a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> in the

later learn the story.

"I soon left Benares, and <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t15 t17 t18 t19 hoverable">set</span> to <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t7 t10 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> in Serampore on the scriptural
writings requested by Babaji," Sri Yukteswar continued. "No sooner
had I begun my task than I was able to compose a poem dedicated to
the deathless guru. The melodious lines flowed effortlessly from
my pen, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> before had I attempted Sanskrit poetry.

"In the quiet of night I busied myself over a comparison of the
Bible and the scriptures of SANATAN DHARMA. {FN36-4} Quoting the

my <span class="t25 hoverable">book</span> was finished in a short time; I realized that this speedy
blessing was due to the grace of my PARAM-GURU-MAHARAJ. {FN36-5}
The chapters <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> appeared in the SADHUSAMBAD journal; later they
were privately printed as a <span class="t25 hoverable">book</span> by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of my Kidderpore disciples.

"The morning after I had concluded my literary efforts," <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span>
continued, "I <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> to the Rai Ghat here to bathe in the Ganges.
The ghat was deserted; I stood still for awhile, enjoying the sunny
peace. After a dip in the sparkling waters, I started for home.
The only sound in the silence was that of my Ganges-drenched cloth,
swish-swashing with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> step. As I passed beyond the site of the
large banyan tree near the river bank, a strong impulse urged me
to look back. There, under the shade of the banyan, and surrounded
by a few disciples, sat the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Babaji!

"'Greetings, Swamiji!' The beautiful voice of the <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">master</span> rang
out to assure me I was not dreaming. 'I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> you have successfully
completed your book. As I promised, I am here to thank you.'

"With a fast-beating heart, I prostrated myself fully at his feet.
'Param-guruji,' I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> imploringly, 'will you and your chelas not
honor my near-by home with your presence?'

"The supreme guru smilingly declined. 'No, child,' he said, 'we are

people who <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> the shelter of trees; this spot is quite comfortable.'

"'Please tarry awhile, Master.' I gazed entreatingly at him. 'I
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> be back at once with some special sweetmeats.'

"When I returned in a few minutes with a dish of delicacies, lo! the
lordly banyan no longer sheltered the celestial troupe. I searched
all around the ghat, but in my <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t16 t19 t22 t23 t25 t26 hoverable">heart</span> I knew the little band had
already fled on etheric wings.

"I was deeply hurt. 'Even if we meet again, I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> not care to talk
to him,' I assured myself. 'He was unkind to leave me so suddenly.'
This was a wrath of love, of course, and <span class="t15 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">nothing</span> more.

"A few months later I visited Lahiri Mahasaya in Benares. As I
entered his little parlor, my guru smiled in greeting.

"'Welcome, Yukteswar,' he said. 'Did you just meet Babaji at the
threshold of my room?'

"'Why, no,' I answered in surprise.

"'Come here.' Lahiri Mahasaya touched me gently on the forehead;
at once I beheld, near the door, the <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of Babaji, blooming <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span>
a perfect lotus.

"I remembered my <span class="t25 hoverable">old</span> hurt, and did not bow. Lahiri Mahasaya looked
at me in astonishment.

"The <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> guru gazed at me with fathomless eyes. 'You are annoyed
with me.'

"'Sir, why shouldn't I be?' I answered. 'Out of the air you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span>
with your magic group, and into the thin air you vanished.'

"'I told you I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> you, but didn't <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">say</span> how <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> remain.'
Babaji laughed softly. 'You were full of excitement. I assure you
that I was fairly extinguished in the ether by the gust of your
restlessness.'

"I was instantly satisfied by this unflattering explanation. I
knelt at his feet; the supreme guru patted me kindly on the shoulder.

"'Child, you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> meditate more,' he said. 'Your gaze is not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span>

With
these <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">words</span> in the voice of a celestial flute, Babaji disappeared
into the hidden radiance.

"That was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of my last visits to Benares to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> my guru," Sri
Yukteswar concluded. "Even as Babaji had foretold at the KUMBHA

MELA, the householder-incarnation of Lahiri Mahasaya was drawing
to a close. During the summer of 1895 his stalwart <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> developed
a small boil on the back. He protested against lancing; he was working
out in his own flesh the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> karma of some of his disciples. Finally
a few chelas became very insistent; the <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">master</span> replied cryptically:

"'The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> has to find a <span class="t1 t3 t9 t15 t20 t21 t26 t29 hoverable">cause</span> to go; I will be agreeable to whatever

"A short <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> later the incomparable guru gave up his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> in

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">Years</span> later, from the lips of Swami Keshabananda, {FN36-6} an
advanced disciple, I heard <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> wonderful details about the passing
of Lahiri Mahasaya.

"A few <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t11 t20 t26 t27 hoverable">days</span> before my guru relinquished his body," Keshabananda told
me, "he materialized himself before me as I sat in my hermitage at
Hardwar.

"'Come at once to Benares.' With these <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">words</span> Lahiri Mahasaya
vanished.

expounded the GITA; then he addressed us simply.

"'I am going home.'

"Sobs of anguish broke out <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> an irresistible torrent.

"Lahiri Mahasaya's beautiful body, so dear to the devotees, was
cremated with solemn householder rites at Manikarnika Ghat by the

suffused with a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> light. Lo! before me stood the flesh and

"'Keshabananda,' he said, 'it is I. From the disintegrated atoms

<span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> on, "I carried with me the sacred ashes of my guru. I <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">know</span> he

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Another</span> disciple who was blessed by the sight of his resurrected
guru was the saintly Panchanon Bhattacharya, founder of the Calcutta
Arya Mission Institution. {FN36-10}

I visited Panchanon at his Calcutta home, and listened with delight
to the story of his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span> with the master. In conclusion, he
told me of the most marvelous event in his life.

"Here in Calcutta," Panchanon said, "at ten o'clock of the morning
which followed his cremation, Lahiri Mahasaya appeared before me
in living glory."

Swami Pranabananda, the "saint with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> bodies," <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> confided to

"A few <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t11 t20 t26 t27 hoverable">days</span> before Lahiri Mahasaya left his body," Pranabananda told
me at the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> he visited my Ranchi school, "I received a letter

of my travel preparations, about ten o'clock in the morning, I was
suddenly overwhelmed with joy to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> the shining figure of my guru.

"'Why hurry to Benares?' Lahiri Mahasaya said, smiling. 'You <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span>

believing that I was seeing him only in a vision.

"The <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">master</span> approached me comfortingly. 'Here, touch my flesh,'
he said. 'I am living, as always. Do not lament; am I not with you
forever?'"

{FN36-2} "Great King"-a title of respect.

speaking, refers only to followers of SANATAN DHARMA or Hinduism.
The term INDIAN applies equally to Hindus and Mohammedans and other
INHABITANTS of the soil of India (and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> through the confusing

{FN36-5} PARAM-GURU is literally "guru supreme" or "guru beyond,"
signifying a line or succession of teachers. Babaji, the GURU of
Lahiri Mahasaya, was the PARAM-GURU of Sri Yukteswar.

{FN36-6} My visit to Keshabananda's ashram is described on pp.
405-408.

{FN36-7} September 26, 1895 is the date on which Lahiri Mahasaya left
his body. In a few more <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t11 t20 t26 t27 hoverable">days</span> he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have reached his sixty-eighth

death, the disciples quarreled over the manner of conducting the
funeral ceremonies. The exasperated <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">master</span> rose from his final sleep,
and gave his instructions. "Half of my remains <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> be buried by
the Moslem rites;" he said, "let the other half be cremated with
a Hindu sacrament." He then vanished. When the disciples opened
the coffin which had contained his body, <span class="t15 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">nothing</span> was <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> but a
dazzling array of gold-colored champak flowers. Half of these were
obediently buried by the Moslems, who revere his shrine to this
day.

In his youth Kabir was approached by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> disciples who wanted minute

simply:

CHAPTER: 37

I GO TO AMERICA

"America! Surely these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> are Americans!" This was my <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span>
as a panoramic vision of Western faces passed before my inward
view.

Immersed in meditation, I was sitting behind some dusty boxes in
the storeroom of the Ranchi school. A private spot was difficult
to find during those busy <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span> with the youngsters!

The vision continued; a vast multitude, {FN37-1} gazing at me
intently, swept actorlike across the stage of consciousness.

The storeroom door opened; as usual, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of the young lads had
discovered my hiding place.

"Come here, Bimal," I cried gaily. "I have news for you: the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span>

"To America?" The boy echoed my <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">words</span> in a tone that implied I had

"Yes!

<span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> he had <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> India; surely there is a karmic link between

Bimal scampered away; soon the <span class="t3 t5 t7 t9 t20 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> school was informed by the
two-legged newspaper. {FN37-2} I summoned the bewildered faculty
and gave the school into its charge.

"I <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">know</span> you will keep Lahiri Mahasaya's yoga ideals of education <span class="t29 hoverable">ever</span>

Tears stood in my eyes as I cast a last look at the little boys
and the sunny acres of Ranchi. A definite epoch in my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> had now
closed, I knew; henceforth I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> dwell in <span class="t6 t9 t18 t26 hoverable">far</span> lands. I entrained
for Calcutta a few hours after my vision. The following <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> I
received an invitation to serve as the delegate from India to an
International Congress of Religious Liberals in America. It was
to convene that year in Boston, under the auspices of the American
Unitarian Association.

My head in a whirl, I sought out Sri Yukteswar in Serampore.

"Guruji, I have just been invited to address a religious congress
in America. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Shall</span> I go?"

"All doors are open for you," <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> replied simply. "It is now or
never."

"But, sir," I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> in dismay, "what do I <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">know</span> about public speaking?
Seldom have I <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> a lecture, and <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> in English."

"English or no English, your <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">words</span> on yoga <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> be heard in the
West."

I laughed. "Well, dear guruji, I hardly think the Americans will
learn Bengali! Please bless me with a push over the hurdles of the
English language." {FN37-3}

When I broke the news of my plans to Father, he was utterly <span class="t19 hoverable">taken</span>
aback. To him America seemed incredibly remote; he feared he <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t18 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">might</span>

"How can you go?" he asked sternly. "Who will finance you?" As he
had affectionately borne the expenses of my education and <span class="t3 t5 t7 t9 t20 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span>
life, he doubtless hoped that his question <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> <span class="t22 hoverable">bring</span> my project
to an embarrassing halt.

"The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> will surely finance me." As I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> this reply, I <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span>
of the similar <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> I had <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> ago to my brother Ananta in
Agra. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Without</span> very <span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">much</span> guile, I added, "Father, perhaps <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> will

"No, never!" He glanced at me piteously.

I was astounded, therefore, when <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t28 hoverable">Father</span> handed me, the following
day, a check <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> out for a large amount.

"I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> you this money," he said, "not in my capacity as a father,
but as a faithful disciple of Lahiri Mahasaya. Go then to that <span class="t6 t9 t18 t26 hoverable">far</span>
Western land; spread there the creedless teachings of KRIYA YOGA."

I was immensely touched at the selfless <span class="t0 t1 t3 t5 t7 t8 t13 t16 t18 t20 t21 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> in which <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t28 hoverable">Father</span>
had been able to quickly <span class="t0 t2 t16 t18 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">put</span> aside his personal desires. The just
realization had <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> to him during the preceding night that no
ordinary desire for foreign travel was motivating my voyage.

"Perhaps we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> not meet again in this life." Father, who was
sixty-seven at this time, spoke sadly.

An intuitive conviction prompted me to reply, "Surely the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> will
<span class="t22 hoverable">bring</span> us <span class="t16 t21 hoverable">together</span> once more."

As I <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> about my preparations to leave <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> and my native
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">land</span> for the unknown shores of America, I experienced not a little
trepidation. I had heard <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> stories about the materialistic
Western atmosphere, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> very <span class="t1 t2 t18 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">different</span> from the <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> background
of India, pervaded with the centuried aura of saints. "An Oriental
teacher who will dare the Western airs," I thought, "must be hardy
beyond the trials of any Himalayan cold!"

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">One</span> early morning I began to pray, with an adamant determination
to continue, to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> die praying, until I heard the voice of God.
I wanted His blessing and assurance that I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> not lose myself
in the fogs of modern utilitarianism. My <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t16 t19 t22 t23 t25 t26 hoverable">heart</span> was <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t15 t17 t18 t19 hoverable">set</span> to go to
America, but <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> more strongly was it resolved to hear the solace
of <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> permission.

I prayed and prayed, muffling my sobs. No answer came. My silent
petition increased in excruciating crescendo until, at noon, I had
reached a zenith; my brain <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> no longer withstand the pressure
of my agonies. If I cried once more with an increased depth of my
inner passion, I felt as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> my brain <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> split. At that moment
there <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> a knock outside the vestibule adjoining the Gurpar Road
room in which I was sitting. Opening the door, I saw a young <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span>
in the scanty garb of a renunciate. He <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> in, closed the door
behind him and, refusing my request to sit down, indicated with a

gesture that he wished to talk to me while standing.

"He <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> be Babaji!" I thought, dazed, because the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> before me
had the features of a younger Lahiri Mahasaya.

He answered my thought. "Yes, I am Babaji." He spoke melodiously
in Hindi. "Our Heavenly <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t28 hoverable">Father</span> has heard your prayer. He commands
me to tell you: Follow the behests of your guru and go to America.
Fear not; you will be protected."

After a vibrant pause, Babaji addressed me again. "You are the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span>
I have chosen to spread the message of KRIYA YOGA in the West. <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Long</span>
ago I met your guru Yukteswar at a KUMBHA MELA; I told him then I
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> send you to him for training."

I was speechless, choked with devotional awe at his presence, and
deeply touched to hear from his own lips that he had guided me
to Sri Yukteswar. I lay prostrate before the deathless guru. He
graciously lifted me from the floor. Telling me <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> about
my life, he then gave me some personal instruction, and uttered a
few secret prophecies.

"KRIYA YOGA, the scientific technique of God-realization," he finally
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> with solemnity, "will ultimately spread in all lands, and aid
in harmonizing the nations through man's personal, transcendental

perception of the Infinite Father."

With a gaze of majestic power, the <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">master</span> electrified me by a
glimpse of his cosmic consciousness. In a short while he started
toward the door.

"Do not try to follow me," he said. "You will not be able to do
so."

"Please, Babaji, don't go away!" I cried repeatedly. "Take me with
you!"

Looking back, he replied, "Not now. Some other time."

Overcome by emotion, I disregarded his warning. As I tried to pursue
him, I discovered that my feet were firmly rooted to the floor.
From the door, Babaji gave me a last affectionate glance. He raised
his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t29 hoverable">hand</span> by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> of benediction and walked away, my eyes fixed on
him longingly.

After a few minutes my feet were free. I sat down and <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> into a
deep meditation, unceasingly thanking <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> not only for answering my
prayer but for blessing me by a meeting with Babaji. My <span class="t3 t5 t7 t9 t20 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span>
seemed sanctified through the touch of the ancient, ever-youthful
master. <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Long</span> had it been my burning desire to <span class="t0 t5 t16 t22 hoverable">behold</span> him.

Until now, I have <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> recounted to anyone this story of my meeting
with Babaji. Holding it as the most sacred of my <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> experiences,
I have hidden it in my heart. But the <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> occurred to me that
readers of this autobiography <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be more inclined to believe in
the reality of the secluded Babaji and his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> interests if I
relate that I saw him with my own eyes. I have helped an artist to

appears in this book.

The eve of my departure for the United States <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> me in Sri
Yukteswar's <span class="t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t12 t15 t19 t20 t23 t25 hoverable">holy</span> presence.

"Forget you were born a Hindu, and don't be an American. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Take</span> the

Then he blessed me: "All those who <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> to you with faith, seeking
God, will be helped. As you look at them, the <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> current
emanating from your eyes will enter into their brains and change

He <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> on, "Your lot to attract sincere souls is very good.

Both of his blessings have been amply demonstrated. I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> alone

I <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> thousands ready to receive the time-tested soul-teachings.

I left India in August, 1920, on THE <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t22 t23 hoverable">CITY</span> OF SPARTA, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span>

fairly miraculous, of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> "red-tape" difficulties concerned with
the granting of my passport.

During the two-months' voyage a fellow passenger <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> out that I
was the Indian delegate to the Boston congress.

"Swami Yogananda," he said, with the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> quaint
pronunciations by which I was later to hear my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> spoken by the
Americans, "please favor the passengers with a lecture next Thursday
night. I think we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> all benefit by a talk on 'The Battle of

Alas! I had to fight the battle of my own life, I discovered on
Wednesday. Desperately trying to organize my ideas into a lecture
in English, I finally abandoned all preparations; my thoughts, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span>
a wild colt eyeing a saddle, refused any cooperation with the laws

of English grammar. Fully trusting in Master's past assurances,
however, I appeared before my Thursday audience in the saloon of
the steamer. No eloquence rose to my lips; speechlessly I stood
before the assemblage. After an endurance contest lasting ten
minutes, the audience realized my predicament and began to laugh.

[Illustration: I stand on the dais before <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of my classes
in America. This class of a thousand yoga students was held in
Washington, D.C.--see dc.jpg]

The situation was not funny to me at the moment; indignantly I sent
a silent prayer to Master.

"You CAN! Speak!" His voice sounded instantly <span class="t5 t7 hoverable">within</span> my consciousness.

My thoughts fell at once into a friendly relation with the English
language. Forty-five minutes later the audience was still attentive.
The talk won me a number of invitations to lecture later before
various groups in America.

I <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> remember, afterward, a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">word</span> that I had spoken. By
discreet inquiry I learned from a number of passengers: "You gave
an inspiring lecture in stirring and correct English." At this
delightful news I humbly thanked my guru for his timely help,
realizing anew that he was <span class="t29 hoverable">ever</span> with me, setting at naught all

barriers of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> and space.

Once in awhile, during the remainder of the ocean trip, I experienced
a few apprehensive twinges about the coming English-lecture ordeal
at the Boston congress.

"Lord," I prayed, "please <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">let</span> my inspiration be Thyself, and not
again the laughter-bombs of the audience!"

THE <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t22 t23 hoverable">CITY</span> OF SPARTA docked near Boston in late September. On the
sixth of October I addressed the congress with my maiden speech in
America. It was <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t8 t10 t12 t13 t14 t17 t19 t23 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> received; I sighed in relief. The magnanimous
secretary of the American Unitarian Association wrote the following
comment in a published account {FN37-4} of the congress proceedings:

"Swami Yogananda, delegate from the Brahmacharya Ashram of Ranchi,
India, <span class="t2 t4 t5 t22 t23 hoverable">brought</span> the greetings of his Association to the Congress.
In fluent English and a forcible delivery he gave an address of
a philosophical character on 'The Science of Religion,' which has
been printed in pamphlet <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> for a wider distribution. Religion,
he maintained, is universal and it is one. We <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">cannot</span> possibly
universalize particular customs and convictions, but the common
element in religion can be universalized, and we can ask all alike
to follow and obey it."

Due to Father's generous check, I was able to remain in America
after the congress was over. Four happy <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span> were spent in humble
circumstances in Boston. I gave public lectures, taught classes,
and wrote a <span class="t25 hoverable">book</span> of poems, SONGS OF THE SOUL, with a preface by
Dr. Frederick B. Robinson, president of the College of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t22 t23 hoverable">City</span>

Starting a transcontinental tour in the summer of 1924, I spoke
before thousands in the principal cities, ending my western trip
with a vacation in the beautiful Alaskan north.

With the help of large-hearted students, by the <span class="t7 t10 t15 t25 hoverable">end</span> of 1925 I had
established an American headquarters on the Mount Washington Estates
in Los Angeles. The building is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> I had seen <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span> before in
my vision at Kashmir. I hastened to send Sri Yukteswar pictures of
these distant American activities. He replied with a postcard in
Bengali, which I here translate:

11th August, 1926

beneath the Mount Washington Estates, I yearn to <span class="t0 t5 t16 t22 hoverable">behold</span> it all with
my own eyes.

Everything here is going on well. Through the grace of God, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span>

CHAPTER: 38

LUTHER BURBANK--A SAINT AMIDST THE ROSES

"The secret of improved plant breeding, apart from scientific
knowledge, is love." Luther Burbank uttered this wisdom as I walked
beside him in his Santa Rosa garden. We halted near a bed of edible
cacti.

"While I was conducting experiments to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> 'spineless' cacti," he
continued, "I often talked to the plants to create a vibration of
love. 'You have <span class="t15 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">nothing</span> to fear,' I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> tell them. 'You don't need
your defensive thorns. I will protect you.' Gradually the useful
plant of the desert emerged in a thornless variety."

I was charmed at this miracle. "Please, dear Luther, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> me a few
cacti leaves to plant in my garden at Mount Washington."

A workman standing near-by started to strip off some leaves; Burbank
prevented him.

"I myself will pluck them for the swami." He handed me <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> leaves,
which later I planted, rejoicing as they grew to huge estate.

of genius, he <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> on to present the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> with hundreds of crossed

squash, cherries, plums, nectarines, berries, poppies, lilies,
roses.

I focused my camera as Luther led me before the famous walnut tree
by which he had proved that natural evolution can be telescopically
hastened.

"In only sixteen years," he said, "this walnut tree reached a state
of abundant nut production to which an unaided <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have

Burbank's little adopted daughter <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> romping with her dog into
the garden.

"She is my <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> plant." Luther waved to her affectionately. "I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span>

I have observed such wondrous progress in plant evolution that I
look forward optimistically to a healthy, happy <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> as soon as its

"Luther, you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> delight in my Ranchi school, with its outdoor

education. He plied me with questions, interest gleaming from his
deep, serene eyes.

"Swamiji," he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> finally, "schools <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> yours are the only hope

As I was taking leave of the gentle sage, he autographed a small volume
and presented it to me. {FN38-1} "Here is my <span class="t25 hoverable">book</span> on THE TRAINING
OF THE <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">HUMAN</span> PLANT," {FN38-2} he said. "New types of training are
needed-fearless experiments. At times the most daring trials have
succeeded in bringing out the best in fruits and flowers. Educational
innovations for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">children</span> should likewise <span class="t8 t13 hoverable">become</span> more numerous, more
courageous."

I read his little <span class="t25 hoverable">book</span> that night with intense interest. His eye
envisioning a glorious future for the race, he wrote: "The most

stubborn living thing in this world, the most difficult to swerve,
is a plant once fixed in <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> habits. . . . Remember that this
plant has preserved its individuality all through the ages; perhaps
it is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> which can be traced backward through eons of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> in the

all these vast periods. Do you suppose, after all these ages of
repetition, the plant does not <span class="t8 t13 hoverable">become</span> possessed of a will, if you
so choose to call it, of unparalleled tenacity? Indeed, there are
plants, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> of the palms, so persistent that no <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span>

it, making, by crossing, a complete and powerful change in its life.
Then when the break comes, fix it by these generations of patient

"When it comes to so sensitive and pliable a thing as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span>
of a child, the problem becomes vastly easier."

Magnetically drawn to this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> American, I visited him again and
again. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">One</span> morning I arrived at the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> as the postman, who
deposited in Burbank's study about a thousand letters. Horticulturists
wrote him from all parts of the world.

"Swamiji, your presence is just the excuse I need to get out into
the garden," Luther <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> gaily. He opened a large desk-drawer
containing hundreds of travel folders.

"See," he said, "this is how I do my traveling. Tied down by my
plants and correspondence, I satisfy my desire for foreign lands
by a glance now and then at these pictures."

My car was standing before his gate; Luther and I drove along the
streets of the little town, its gardens bright with his own varieties
of Santa Rosa, Peachblow, and Burbank roses.

"My friend Henry Ford and I both believe in the ancient theory of
reincarnation," Luther told me. "It sheds <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> on aspects of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span>
otherwise inexplicable. Memory is not a test of truth; just because

them. Memory is blank concerning his womb-life and infancy, too;
but he probably passed through them!" He chuckled.

The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> scientist had received KRIYA initiation during <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of my
earlier visits. "I practice the technique devoutly, Swamiji," he
said. After <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> thoughtful questions to me about various aspects
of yoga, Luther remarked slowly:

"The East indeed possesses immense hoards of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> which the
West has scarcely begun to explore."

Intimate communion with nature, who unlocked to him <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> of her
jealously guarded secrets, had <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> Burbank a boundless <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span>
reverence.

"Sometimes I feel very close to the Infinite Power," he confided
shyly. His sensitive, beautifully modeled face lit with his memories.
"Then I have been able to heal sick persons around me, as <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t8 t10 t12 t13 t14 t17 t19 t23 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> as
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> ailing plants."

He told me of his mother, a sincere Christian. "Many times after
her death," Luther said, "I have been blessed by her appearance in
visions; she has spoken to me."

We drove back reluctantly toward his home and those waiting thousand
letters.

"Luther," I remarked, "next month I am starting a magazine to present
the truth-offerings of East and West. Please help me decide on a
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> for the journal."

We discussed titles for awhile, and finally agreed on EAST-WEST.
After we had reentered his study, Burbank gave me an article he

had <span class="t23 hoverable">written</span> on "Science and Civilization."

"This will go in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> issue of EAST-WEST," I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> gratefully.

As our friendship grew deeper, I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Burbank my "American saint."
"Behold a man," I quoted, "in whom there is no guile!" His <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t16 t19 t22 t23 t25 t26 hoverable">heart</span>
was fathomlessly deep, <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> acquainted with humility, patience,
sacrifice. His little home amidst the roses was austerely simple;
he knew the worthlessness of luxury, the joy of few possessions. The
modesty with which he wore his scientific fame repeatedly reminded
me of the trees that bend low with the burden of ripening fruits;
it is the barren tree that lifts its head high in an empty boast.

I was in <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">New</span> York when, in 1926, my dear friend passed away. In
tears I thought, "Oh, I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> gladly walk all the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> from here to

Locking myself <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">away</span> from
secretaries and visitors, I spent the next twenty-four hours in
seclusion.

The following <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> I conducted a Vedic memorial rite around a large
picture of Luther. A group of my American students, garbed in Hindu
ceremonial clothes, chanted the ancient hymns as an offering was
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> of flowers, water, and fire-symbols of the bodily elements
and their release in the Infinite Source.

Though the <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of Burbank lies in Santa Rosa under a Lebanon cedar
that he planted <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span> ago in his garden, his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> is enshrined for
me in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> wide-eyed flower that blooms by the wayside. Withdrawn

whispering in her winds, walking her dawns?

His <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> has now passed into the heritage of common speech. Listing
"burbank" as a transitive verb, Webster's <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">New</span> International Dictionary
defines it: "To cross or graft (a plant). Hence, figuratively, to

"Beloved Burbank," I cried after reading the definition, "your very

I have examined the Yogoda system of Swami Yogananda and in my
opinion it is ideal for training and harmonizing man's physical,

mental, and <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> natures. Swami's aim is to establish
"How-to-Live" schools throughout the world, wherein education will
not confine itself to intellectual development alone, but <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span>
training of the body, will, and feelings.

Through the Yogoda system of physical, mental, and <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span>
unfoldment by simple and scientific methods of concentration and
meditation, most of the complex problems of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be solved,

The Swami's idea of
<span class="t27 hoverable">right</span> education is plain commonsense, free from all mysticism and
non-praciticality; otherwise it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> not have my approval.

I am glad to have this opportunity of heartily joining with the
Swami in his appeal for international schools on the art of living
which, if established, will <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> as near to bringing the millennium
as anything with which I am acquainted.

in triumph to Calcutta.

CHAPTER: 39

THERESE NEUMANN, THE CATHOLIC STIGMATIST

"Return to india. I have waited for you patiently for fifteen
years. Soon I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> swim out of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> and on to the Shining
Abode. Yogananda, come!"

Sri Yukteswar's voice sounded startlingly in my inner ear as I sat
in meditation at my Mt. Washington headquarters. Traversing ten
thousand miles in the twinkling of an eye, his message penetrated
my being <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> a flash of lightning.

Fifteen years! Yes, I realized, now it is 1935; I have spent fifteen
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span> in spreading my guru's teachings in America. Now he recalls
me.

That afternoon I recounted my experience to a visiting disciple.
His <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> development under KRIYA YOGA was so remarkable that
I often <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> him "saint," remembering Babaji's prophecy that America
too <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> produce <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> and women of <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> realization through the
ancient yogic path.

This disciple and a number of <span class="t1 t7 t13 hoverable">others</span> generously insisted on making a
donation for my travels. The financial problem <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> solved, I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span>
arrangements to sail, via Europe, for India. Busy weeks of preparations
at Mount Washington! In March, 1935 I had the Self-Realization
Fellowship chartered under the laws of the State of California as
a non-profit corporation. To this educational institution go all
public donations as <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t8 t10 t12 t13 t14 t17 t19 t23 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> as the revenue from the sale of my books,
magazine, <span class="t23 hoverable">written</span> courses, class tuition, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> other source
of income.

"I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> be back," I told my students. "Never <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> I forget
America."

At a farewell banquet <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> to me in Los Angeles by loving friends,
I looked <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> at their faces and <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> gratefully, "Lord, he who
remembers <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thee</span> as the Sole Giver will <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> lack the sweetness of
friendship <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span> mortals."

I sailed from <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">New</span> York on June 9, 1935 {FN39-1} in the EUROPA. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Two</span>
students accompanied me: my secretary, Mr. C. Richard Wright, and
an elderly lady from Cincinnati, Miss Ettie Bletch. We enjoyed the
<span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t11 t20 t26 t27 hoverable">days</span> of ocean peace, a welcome contrast to the past hurried weeks.
Our period of leisure was short-lived; the speed of modern boats
has some regrettable features!

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Like</span> any other group of inquisitive tourists, we walked around the
huge and ancient <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t22 t23 hoverable">city</span> of London. The following <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> I was invited to
address a large meeting in Caxton Hall, at which I was introduced
to the London audience by Sir Francis Younghusband. Our party
spent a pleasant <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> as guests of Sir Harry Lauder at his estate
in Scotland. We soon crossed the English Channel to the continent,
for I wanted to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> a special pilgrimage to Bavaria. This <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span>
be my only chance, I felt, to visit the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Catholic mystic,
Therese Neumann of Konnersreuth.

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">Years</span> earlier I had read an amazing account of Therese. Information
<span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> in the article was as follows:

(1) Therese, born in 1898, had been injured in an accident at the
age of twenty; she became blind and paralyzed.

(2) She miraculously regained her sight in 1923 through prayers
to St. Teresa, "The Little Flower." Later Therese Neumann's limbs

were instantaneously healed.

(3) From 1923 onward, Therese has abstained completely from food
and drink, except for the daily swallowing of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> small consecrated
wafer.

(4) The stigmata, or sacred wounds of Christ, appeared in 1926 on
Therese's head, breast, hands, and feet. On Friday of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> week
thereafter, she has passed through the Passion of Christ, suffering
in her own <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> all his historic agonies.

(5) Knowing ordinarily only the simple German of her village,
during her Friday trances Therese utters phrases which scholars
have identified as ancient Aramaic. At appropriate times in her
vision, she speaks Hebrew or Greek.

(6) By ecclesiastical permission, Therese has several times been
under close scientific observation. Dr. Fritz Gerlick, editor of
a Protestant German newspaper, <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> to Konnersreuth to "expose the
Catholic fraud," but ended up by reverently writing her biography.
{FN39-2}

As always, whether in East or West, I was eager to meet a saint.
I rejoiced as our little party entered, on July 16th, the quaint
village of Konnersreuth. The Bavarian peasants exhibited lively

interest in our Ford automobile (brought with us from America) and
its assorted group-an American young man, an elderly lady, and an
olive-hued Oriental with <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> hair tucked under his coat collar.

Therese's little cottage, clean and neat, with geraniums blooming
by a primitive well, was alas! silently closed. The neighbors, and
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> the village postman who passed by, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> us no information.
Rain began to fall; my companions suggested that we leave.

"No," I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> stubbornly, "I will stay here until I find some clue
leading to Therese."

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Two</span> hours later we were still sitting in our car amidst the dismal
rain. "Lord," I sighed complainingly, "why didst <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thou</span> lead me here
if she has disappeared?"

An English-speaking <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> halted beside us, politely offering his
aid.

"I don't <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">know</span> for <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> where Therese is," he said, "but she
often visits at the home of Professor Wurz, a seminary <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">master</span> of
Eichstatt, eighty miles from here."

The following morning our party motored to the quiet village
of Eichstatt, narrowly lined with cobblestoned streets. Dr. Wurz

greeted us cordially at his home; "Yes, Therese is here." He sent
her <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">word</span> of the visitors. A messenger soon appeared with her reply.

"Though the bishop has asked me to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> his permission,
I will receive the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> from India."

Deeply touched at these words, I followed Dr. Wurz upstairs to the
sitting room. Therese entered immediately, radiating an aura of
peace and joy. She wore a black gown and spotless white head dress.
Although her age was thirty-seven at this time, she seemed <span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">much</span>
younger, possessing indeed a childlike freshness and charm. Healthy,
well-formed, rosy-cheeked, and cheerful, this is the saint that
does not eat!

Therese greeted me with a very gentle handshaking. We both beamed
in silent communion, each knowing the other to be a lover of God.

Dr. Wurz kindly offered to serve as interpreter. As we seated
ourselves, I noticed that Therese was glancing at me with naive
curiosity; evidently Hindus had been rare in Bavaria.

"Don't you eat anything?" I wanted to hear the answer from her own
lips.

"No, except a consecrated rice-flour wafer, once <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> morning at

six o'clock."

"How large is the wafer?"

"It is paper-thin, the size of a small coin." She added, "I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">take</span>
it for sacramental reasons; if it is unconsecrated, I am unable to
swallow it."

"Certainly you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> not have lived on that, for twelve <span class="t3 t5 t7 t9 t20 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span>
years?"

"I live by God's light." How simple her reply, how Einsteinian!

"I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> you realize that energy flows to your <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> from the ether,
sun, and air."

A swift smile broke over her face. "I am so happy to <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">know</span> you
understand how I live."

"Your sacred <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> is a daily demonstration of the <span class="t3 t7 t9 t10 t15 t19 t22 hoverable">truth</span> uttered by
Christ: 'Man <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> not live by bread alone, but by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">word</span> that
proceedeth out of the mouth of God.'" {FN39-3}

Again she showed joy at my explanation. "It is indeed so. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">One</span> of

by God's invisible light, and not by food only."

"Can you teach <span class="t1 t7 t13 hoverable">others</span> how to live <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> food?"

She appeared a trifle shocked. "I <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">cannot</span> do that; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> does not wish
it."

As my gaze fell on her strong, graceful hands, Therese showed me
a little, square, freshly healed wound on each of her palms. On
the back of each hand, she pointed out a smaller, crescent-shaped
wound, freshly healed. Each wound <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> straight through the hand.
The sight <span class="t2 t4 t5 t22 t23 hoverable">brought</span> to my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> distinct recollection of the large
square iron nails with crescent-tipped ends, still <span class="t27 hoverable">used</span> in the
Orient, but which I do not recall having seen in the West.

The saint told me something of her weekly trances. "As a helpless
onlooker, I observe the <span class="t3 t5 t7 t9 t20 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> Passion of Christ." Each week, from
Thursday midnight until Friday afternoon at <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> o'clock, her wounds
open and bleed; she loses ten pounds of her ordinary 121-pound
weight. Suffering intensely in her sympathetic love, Therese <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span>
looks forward joyously to these weekly visions of her Lord.

I realized at once that her strange <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> is intended by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> to reassure
all Christians of the historical authenticity of Jesus' <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> and
crucifixion as recorded in the <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">New</span> Testament, and to dramatically

display the ever-living bond between the Galilean <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> and his
devotees.

Professor Wurz related some of his experiences with the saint.

"Several of us, including Therese, often travel for <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t11 t20 t26 t27 hoverable">days</span> on
sight-seeing trips throughout Germany," he told me. "It is a striking
contrast-while we have <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> meals a day, Therese eats nothing.
She remains as fresh as a rose, untouched by the fatigue which the
trips <span class="t1 t3 t9 t15 t20 t21 t26 t29 hoverable">cause</span> us. As we grow hungry and hunt for wayside inns, she
laughs merrily."

The professor added some interesting physiological details: "Because
Therese takes no food, her stomach has shrunk. She has no excretions,
but her perspiration glands function; her skin is always soft and
firm."

At the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of parting, I expressed to Therese my desire to be
present at her trance.

"Yes, please <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> to Konnersreuth next Friday," she <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> graciously.
"The bishop will <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> you a permit. I am very happy you sought me
out in Eichstatt."

Therese shook hands gently, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> times, and walked with our party

to the gate. Mr. Wright turned on the automobile radio; the saint
examined it with little enthusiastic chuckles. Such a large crowd
of youngsters gathered that Therese retreated into the house. We
saw her at a window, where she peered at us, childlike, waving her
hand.

From a conversation the next <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> of Therese's brothers,
very kind and amiable, we learned that the saint sleeps only <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span>
or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> hours at night. In spite of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> wounds in her body,
she is active and full of energy. She loves birds, looks after an
aquarium of fish, and <span class="t9 t16 t26 hoverable">works</span> often in her garden. Her correspondence
is large; Catholic devotees write her for prayers and healing
blessings. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Many</span> seekers have been cured through her of serious
diseases.

Her brother Ferdinand, about twenty-three, explained that Therese
has the power, through prayer, of working out on her own <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> the
ailments of others. The saint's abstinence from food dates from a
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> when she prayed that the throat disease of a young <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> of her
parish, then preparing to enter <span class="t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t12 t15 t19 t20 t23 t25 hoverable">holy</span> orders, be transferred to her
own throat.

On Thursday afternoon our party drove to the home of the bishop,
who looked at my flowing locks with some surprise. He readily
wrote out the necessary permit. There was no fee; the rule <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> by

the Church is simply to protect Therese from the onrush of casual
tourists, who in previous <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span> had flocked on Fridays by the
thousands.

We arrived Friday morning about nine-thirty in Konnersreuth. I
noticed that Therese's little cottage possesses a special glass-roofed
section to afford her plenty of light. We were glad to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> the
doors no longer closed, but wide-open in hospitable cheer. There
was a line of about twenty visitors, armed with their permits. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Many</span>
had <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> distances to view the mystic trance.

Therese had passed my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> test at the professor's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> by her
intuitive <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> that I wanted to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> her for <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> reasons,
and not just to satisfy a passing curiosity.

My <span class="t6 hoverable">second</span> test was connected with the fact that, just before I
<span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> upstairs to her room, I <span class="t0 t2 t16 t18 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">put</span> myself into a yogic trance state
in <span class="t0 t6 t7 t8 t11 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">order</span> to be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> with her in telepathic and televisic rapport. I
entered her chamber, filled with visitors; she was lying in a white
robe on the bed. With Mr. Wright following closely behind me, I
halted just inside the threshold, awestruck at a strange and most
frightful spectacle.

[Illustration: THERESE NEUMANN, Famous Catholic Stigmatist who
inspired my 1935 pilgrimage to Konnersreuth, Bavaria--see neumann.jpg]

Blood flowed thinly and continuously in an inch-wide stream from
Therese's lower eyelids. Her gaze was focused upward on the <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span>
eye <span class="t5 t7 hoverable">within</span> the central forehead. The cloth wrapped around her head
was drenched in blood from the stigmata wounds of the crown of
thorns. The white garment was redly splotched over her <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t16 t19 t22 t23 t25 t26 hoverable">heart</span> from
the wound in her side at the spot where Christ's body, <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> ages
ago, had suffered the final indignity of the soldier's spear-thrust.

Therese's hands were extended in a gesture maternal, pleading;
her face wore an expression both tortured and divine. She appeared
thinner, changed in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> subtle as <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t8 t10 t12 t13 t14 t17 t19 t23 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> as outward ways. Murmuring
<span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">words</span> in a foreign tongue, she spoke with slightly quivering lips
to persons visible before her inner sight.

As I was in attunement with her, I began to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> the scenes of
her vision. She was watching <span class="t4 t17 t22 hoverable">Jesus</span> as he carried the cross amidst
the jeering multitude. {FN39-4} Suddenly she lifted her head
in consternation: the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> had fallen under the cruel weight. The
vision disappeared. In the exhaustion of fervid pity, Therese sank
heavily against her pillow.

At this moment I heard a loud thud behind me. Turning my head for
a second, I saw <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> carrying out a prostrate body. But because
I was coming out of the deep superconscious state, I did not

immediately recognize the fallen person. Again I fixed my eyes on
Therese's face, deathly pale under the rivulets of blood, but now
calm, radiating purity and holiness. I glanced behind me later
and saw Mr. Wright standing with his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t29 hoverable">hand</span> against his cheek, from
which blood was trickling.

"Dick," I inquired anxiously, "were you the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> who fell?"

"Yes, I fainted at the terrifying spectacle."

"Well," I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> consolingly, "you are brave to return and look <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span>
the sight again."

Remembering the patiently waiting line of pilgrims, Mr. Wright and
I silently bade farewell to Therese and left her sacred presence.

The following <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> our little group motored south, thankful that we

Francis. The European tour ended in Greece, where we viewed the
Athenian temples, and saw the prison in which the gentle Socrates

CHAPTER: 40

I RETURN TO INDIA

Gratefully I was inhaling the blessed air of India. Our boat
RAJPUTANA docked on August 22, 1935 in the huge harbor of Bombay.
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Even</span> this, my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> off the ship, was a foretaste of the year
ahead-twelve months of ceaseless activity. Friends had gathered
at the dock with garlands and greetings; soon, at our suite in the
Taj Mahal Hotel, there was a stream of reporters and photographers.

Bombay was a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t22 t23 hoverable">city</span> <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> to me; I <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> it energetically modern, with
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> innovations from the West. Palms line the spacious boulevards;
magnificent state structures vie for interest with ancient temples.
Very little <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> was <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> to sight-seeing, however; I was impatient,
eager to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> my beloved guru and other dear ones. Consigning the
Ford to a baggage car, our party was soon speeding eastward by
train toward Calcutta. {FN40-1}

Our arrival at Howrah Station <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> such an immense crowd assembled
to greet us that for awhile we were unable to dismount from the
train. The young Maharaja of Kasimbazar and my brother Bishnu
headed the reception committee; I was unprepared for the warmth
and magnitude of our welcome.

Preceded by a line of automobiles and motorcycles, and amidst the
joyous sound of drums and conch shells, Miss Bletch, Mr. Wright,
and myself, flower-garlanded from head to foot, drove slowly to my
father's home.

My aged parent embraced me as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> returning from the dead; <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span>
we gazed on each other, speechless with joy. Brothers and sisters,
uncles, aunts, and cousins, students and friends of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span> <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> past
were grouped around me, not a dry eye <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span> us. Passed now into the
archives of memory, the scene of loving reunion vividly endures,

unforgettable in my heart.

As for my meeting with Sri Yukteswar, <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">words</span> fail me; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">let</span> the
following description from my secretary suffice.

"Today, filled with the <span class="t6 t9 t22 t29 hoverable">highest</span> anticipations, I drove Yoganandaji
from Calcutta to Serampore," Mr. Wright recorded in his travel diary.
"We passed by quaint shops, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of them the favorite eating haunt
of Yoganandaji during his college days, and finally entered a narrow,
walled lane. A sudden left turn, and there before us towered the
simple but inspiring two-story ashram, its Spanish-style balcony
jutting from the upper floor. The pervasive impression was that of
peaceful solitude.

"In grave humility I walked behind Yoganandaji into the courtyard
<span class="t5 t7 hoverable">within</span> the hermitage walls. Hearts beating fast, we proceeded up
some <span class="t25 hoverable">old</span> cement steps, trod, no doubt, by myriads of truth-seekers.
The tension grew keener and keener as on we strode. Before us, near
the head of the stairs, quietly appeared the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Great</span> One, Swami Sri
Yukteswarji, standing in the noble pose of a sage.

"My <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t16 t19 t22 t23 t25 t26 hoverable">heart</span> heaved and swelled as I felt myself blessed by the
privilege of being in his sublime presence. Tears blurred my eager
sight when Yoganandaji dropped to his knees, and with bowed head
offered his soul's gratitude and greeting, touching with his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t29 hoverable">hand</span>

his guru's feet and then, in humble obeisance, his own head. He rose
then and was embraced on both sides of the bosom by Sri Yukteswarji.

"No <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">words</span> passed at the beginning, but the most intense feeling was
expressed in the mute phrases of the soul. How their eyes sparkled
and were fired with the warmth of renewed soul-union! A tender
vibration surged through the quiet patio, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t14 t23 t25 t28 hoverable">sun</span> eluded
the clouds to add a sudden blaze of glory.

"On bended knee before the <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">master</span> I gave my own unexpressed <span class="t7 hoverable">love</span>
and thanks, touching his feet, calloused by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> and service,
and receiving his blessing. I stood then and faced <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> beautiful
deep eyes smouldering with introspection, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> radiant with joy.
We entered his sitting room, <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whose</span> <span class="t3 t5 t7 t9 t20 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> side opened to the outer
balcony <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> seen from the street. The <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">master</span> braced himself
against a worn davenport, sitting on a covered mattress on the
cement floor. Yoganandaji and I sat near the guru's feet, with
orange-colored pillows to lean against and ease our positions on
the straw mat.

"I tried and tried to penetrate the Bengali conversation between
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> Swamijis-for English, I discovered, is null and void when

the saintliness of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Great</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">One</span> through his heart-warming smile

and twinkling eyes. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">One</span> quality easily discernible in his merry,
serious conversation is a decided positiveness in statement-the
mark of a wise man, who knows he knows, because he knows God. His
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> wisdom, strength of purpose, and determination are apparent
in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> way.

"Studying him reverently from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> to time, I noted that he is of
large, athletic stature, hardened by the trials and sacrifices of
renunciation. His poise is majestic. A decidedly sloping forehead,
as if seeking the heavens, dominates his <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> countenance. He
has a rather large and homely nose, with which he amuses himself
in idle moments, flipping and wiggling it with his fingers, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> a
child. His powerful dark eyes are haloed by an ethereal blue ring.
His hair, parted in the middle, begins as silver and changes to
streaks of silvery-gold and silvery-black, ending in ringlets at
his shoulders. His beard and moustache are scant or thinned out,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> seem to enhance his features and, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> his character, are deep
and <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> at the same time.

"He has a jovial and rollicking laugh which comes from deep in his
chest, causing him to shake and quiver throughout his body-very
cheerful and sincere. His face and stature are striking in their
power, as are his muscular fingers. He moves with a dignified tread
and erect posture.

"He was clad simply in the common DHOTI and shirt, both once dyed
a strong ocher color, but now a faded orange.

"Glancing about, I observed that this rather dilapidated room suggested
the owner's non-attachment to material comforts. The weather-stained
white walls of the <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> chamber were streaked with fading blue
plaster. At <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> <span class="t7 t10 t15 t25 hoverable">end</span> of the room hung a picture of Lahiri Mahasaya,
garlanded in simple devotion. There was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> an <span class="t25 hoverable">old</span> picture showing
Yoganandaji as he had <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> arrived in Boston, standing with the
other delegates to the Congress of Religions.

"I noted a quaint concurrence of modernity and antiquation. A
huge, cut-glass, candle-light chandelier was covered with cobwebs
through disuse, and on the wall was a bright, up-to-date calendar.
The <span class="t3 t5 t7 t9 t20 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> room emanated a fragrance of peace and calmness. Beyond
the balcony I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> coconut trees towering over the hermitage
in silent protection.

"It is interesting to observe that the <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">master</span> has merely to clap
his hands <span class="t16 t21 hoverable">together</span> and, before finishing, he is served or attended
by some small disciple. Incidentally, I am <span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">much</span> attracted to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span>
of them-a thin lad, named Prafulla, {FN40-2} with <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> black hair
to his shoulders, a most penetrating pair of sparkling black eyes,
and a heavenly smile; his eyes twinkle, as the corners of his mouth
rise, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> the stars and the crescent moon appearing at twilight.

"Swami Sri Yukteswarji's joy is obviously intense at the return of
his 'product' (and he seems to be somewhat inquisitive about the
'product's product'). However, predominance of the wisdom-aspect
in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Great</span> One's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> hinders his outward expression of feeling.

"Yoganandaji presented him with some gifts, as is the custom when
the disciple returns to his guru. We sat down later to a simple
but well-cooked meal. All the dishes were vegetable and rice
combinations. Sri Yukteswarji was pleased at my use of a number of
Indian customs, 'finger-eating' for example.

"After several hours of flying Bengali phrases and the exchange
of warm smiles and joyful glances, we paid obeisance at his feet,
bade adieu with a PRONAM, {FN40-3} and departed for Calcutta with
an everlasting memory of a sacred meeting and greeting. Although I
write chiefly of my external impressions of him, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> I was always
conscious of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> basis of the saint-his <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> glory. I
felt his power, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> carry that feeling as my <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> blessing."

From America, Europe, and Palestine I had <span class="t2 t4 t5 t22 t23 hoverable">brought</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> presents
for Sri Yukteswar. He received them smilingly, but <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> remark.
For my own use, I had bought in Germany a combination umbrella-cane.
In India I decided to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> the cane to Master.

"This gift I appreciate indeed!" My guru's eyes were turned on me
with affectionate understanding as he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> the unwonted comment.
From all the presents, it was the cane that he singled out to
display to visitors.

"Master, please permit me to get a <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> carpet for the sitting room."
I had noticed that Sri Yukteswar's tiger skin was placed over a
torn rug.

"Do so if it pleases you." My guru's voice was not enthusiastic.
"Behold, my tiger mat is nice and clean; I am monarch in my own
little kingdom. Beyond it is the vast world, interested only in
externals."

As he uttered these <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">words</span> I felt the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span> roll back; once again
I am a young disciple, purified in the daily fires of chastisement!

As soon as I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> tear myself <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">away</span> from Serampore and Calcutta,
I <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t15 t17 t18 t19 hoverable">set</span> out, with Mr. Wright, for Ranchi. What a welcome there, a
veritable ovation! Tears stood in my eyes as I embraced the selfless
teachers who had kept the banner of the school flying during my
fifteen years' absence. The bright faces and happy smiles of the
residential and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> students were ample testimony to the worth of
their many-sided school and yoga training.

Yet, alas! the Ranchi institution was in dire financial difficulties.
Sir Manindra Chandra Nundy, the <span class="t25 hoverable">old</span> Maharaja <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whose</span> Kasimbazar Palace
had been converted into the central school building, and who had

features of the school were now seriously endangered for lack of
sufficient public support.

I had not spent <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span> in America <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> learning some of its
practical wisdom, its undaunted <span class="t0 t1 t3 t5 t7 t8 t13 t16 t18 t20 t21 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> before obstacles. For <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span>
week I remained in Ranchi, wrestling with critical problems. Then
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> interviews in Calcutta with prominent leaders and educators,
a <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> talk with the young Maharaja of Kasimbazar, a financial
appeal to my father, and lo! the shaky foundations of Ranchi began
to be righted. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Many</span> donations including <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> huge check arrived in
the nick of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> from my American students.

<span class="t5 t7 hoverable">Within</span> a few months after my arrival in India, I had the joy of
seeing the Ranchi school legally incorporated. My lifelong dream
of a permanently endowed yoga educational center stood fulfilled.
That vision had guided me in the humble beginnings in 1917 with a
group of seven boys.

In the decade since 1935, Ranchi has enlarged its scope <span class="t6 t9 t18 t26 hoverable">far</span> beyond
the boys' school. Widespread humanitarian activities are now carried
on there in the Shyama Charan Lahiri Mahasaya Mission.

The school, or Yogoda Sat-Sanga Brahmacharya Vidyalaya, conducts
outdoor classes in grammar and high school subjects. The residential
students and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> scholars <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> receive vocational training of some
kind. The boys themselves regulate most of their activities through
autonomous committees. Very early in my career as an educator I
discovered that boys who impishly delight in outwitting a teacher
will cheerfully accept disciplinary rules that are <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t15 t17 t18 t19 hoverable">set</span> by their
fellow students. <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">Never</span> a model pupil myself, I had a ready sympathy
for all boyish pranks and problems.

Sports and games are encouraged; the fields resound with hockey and
football practice. Ranchi students often win the cup at competitive
events. The outdoor gymnasium is <span class="t6 t10 t15 hoverable">known</span> <span class="t6 t9 t18 t26 hoverable">far</span> and wide. Muscle recharging
through will <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> is the YOGODA feature: mental direction of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span>
energy to any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of the body. The boys are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> taught ASANAS
(postures), sword and LATHI (stick) play, and jujitsu. The Yogoda
Health Exhibitions at the Ranchi VIDYALAYA have been attended by
thousands.

Instruction in primary subjects is <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> in Hindi to the KOLS,
SANTALS, and MUNDAS, aboriginal tribes of the province. Classes
for girls only have been organized in near-by villages.

The unique feature at Ranchi is the initiation into KRIYA YOGA.

The boys daily practice their <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> exercises, engage in GITA
chanting, and are taught by precept and example the virtues of
simplicity, self-sacrifice, honor, and truth. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Evil</span> is pointed out
to them as being that which produces misery; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> as those actions
which result in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> happiness. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Evil</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be compared to poisoned
honey, tempting but laden with death.

Overcoming restlessness of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> by concentration techniques
has achieved astonishing results: it is no novelty at Ranchi to
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> an appealing little figure, aged nine or ten years, sitting for
an hour or more in unbroken poise, the unwinking gaze directed to
the <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> eye. Often the picture of these Ranchi students has
returned to my mind, as I observed collegians over the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> who
are hardly able to sit still through <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> class period. {FN40-4}

Ranchi lies 2000 feet above sea level; the climate is mild and
equable. The twenty-five acre site, by a large bathing pond, includes
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of the finest orchards in India-five hundred fruit trees-mango,
guava, litchi, jackfruit, date. The boys grow their own vegetables,
and spin at their CHARKAS.

A guest <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> is hospitably open for Western visitors. The Ranchi
library contains numerous magazines, and about a thousand volumes
in English and Bengali, donations from the West and the East. There
is a collection of the scriptures of the world. A well-classified

museum displays archeological, geological, and anthropological
exhibits; trophies, to a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> extent, of my wanderings over the
Lord's varied earth.

The charitable hospital and dispensary of the Lahiri Mahasaya
Mission, with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> outdoor branches in distant villages, have
already ministered to 150,000 of India's poor. The Ranchi students
are trained in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> aid, and have <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> praiseworthy service to
their province at tragic times of flood or famine.

In the orchard stands a Shiva temple, with a statue of the blessed
master, Lahiri Mahasaya. Daily prayers and scripture classes are
held in the garden under the mango bowers.

Branch high schools, with the residential and yoga features of Ranchi,
have been opened and are now flourishing. These are the Yogoda
Sat-Sanga Vidyapith (School) for Boys, at Lakshmanpur in Bihar;
and the Yogoda Sat-Sanga High School and hermitage at Ejmalichak
in Midnapore.

A stately Yogoda Math was dedicated in 1939 at Dakshineswar,
directly on the Ganges. Only a few miles north of Calcutta, the
<span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> hermitage affords a haven of peace for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t22 t23 hoverable">city</span> dwellers. Suitable
accommodations are available for Western guests, and particularly
for those seekers who are intensely dedicating their lives to

spiritual realization. The activities of the Yogoda Math include
a fortnightly mailing of Self-Realization Fellowship teachings to
students in various parts of India.

It is needless to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">say</span> that all these educational and humanitarian
activities have required the self-sacrificing service and devotion
of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> teachers and workers. I do not list their names here,

niche. Inspired by the ideals of Lahiri Mahasaya, these teachers

Serampore, everywhere he went, my secretary, who has a vivid gift
of description, hauled out his travel diary to record his adventures.

"Dick, what is your impression of India?"

"Peace," he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> thoughtfully. "The racial aura is peace."

simultaneously to do all these feats purely by mental processes,

apt to depreciate such efforts by affecting to believe that they
involve only the exercise of the lower functionings of the brain.
It is not, however, a pure question of memory. The greater factor
is the immense concentration of mind."

CHAPTER: 41

AN IDYL IN SOUTH INDIA

"You are the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> Westerner, Dick, <span class="t29 hoverable">ever</span> to enter that shrine. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Many</span>
<span class="t1 t7 t13 hoverable">others</span> have tried in vain."

At my <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">words</span> Mr. Wright looked startled, then pleased. We had just
left the beautiful Chamundi Temple in the hills overlooking Mysore
in southern India. There we had bowed before the gold and silver
altars of the Goddess Chamundi, patron deity of the family of the

reigning maharaja.

"As a souvenir of the unique honor," Mr. Wright said, carefully
stowing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">away</span> a few blessed rose petals, "I will always preserve
this flower, sprinkled by the priest with rose water."

My companion and I {FN41-1} were spending the month of November,
1935, as guests of the State of Mysore. The Maharaja, H.H.
Sri Krishnaraja Wadiyar IV, is a model prince with intelligent
devotion to his people. A pious Hindu, the Maharaja has empowered
a Mohammedan, the able Mirza Ismail, as his Dewan or Premier.
Popular representation is <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> to the seven million inhabitants
of Mysore in both an Assembly and a Legislative Council.

The heir to the Maharaja, H.H. the Yuvaraja, Sir Sri Krishna
Narasingharaj Wadiyar, had invited my secretary and me to visit
his enlightened and progressive realm. During the past fortnight
I had addressed thousands of Mysore citizens and students, at the
Town Hall, the Maharajah's College, the University Medical School;
and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> mass meetings in Bangalore, at the National High School,
the Intermediate College, and the Chetty Town Hall where over
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> thousand persons had assembled. Whether the eager listeners
had been able to credit the glowing picture I drew of America,
I <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">know</span> not; but the applause had always been loudest when I spoke
of the mutual benefits that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> flow from exchange of the best

features in East and West.

Mr. Wright and I were now relaxing in the tropical peace. His travel
diary gives the following account of his impressions of Mysore:

"Brilliantly green rice fields, varied by tasseled sugar cane
patches, nestle at the protective foot of rocky hills-hills dotting
the emerald panorama <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> excrescences of black stone-and the play
of colors is enhanced by the sudden and dramatic disappearance of
the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t14 t23 t25 t28 hoverable">sun</span> as it seeks rest behind the solemn hills.

"Many rapturous moments have been spent in gazing, almost absent-mindedly,
at the ever-changing canvas of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> stretched across the firmament,
for His touch alone is able to produce colors that vibrate with the
freshness of life. That youth of colors is lost when <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> tries to
imitate with mere pigments, for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> resorts to a more simple
and effective medium-oils that are <span class="t4 t18 t22 hoverable">neither</span> oils nor pigments, but
mere rays of light. He tosses a splash of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> here, and it reflects
red; He waves the brush again and it blends gradually into orange
and gold; then with a piercing thrust He stabs the clouds with a
streak of purple that leaves a ringlet or fringe of red oozing out
of the wound in the clouds; and so, on and on, He plays, night and
morning alike, ever-changing, ever-new, ever-fresh; no patterns,
no duplicates, no colors just the same. The beauty of the Indian
change in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> to night is beyond compare elsewhere; often the sky

looks as if <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> had <span class="t19 hoverable">taken</span> all the colors in His kit and <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> them

"I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> relate the splendor of a twilight visit to the huge
Krishnaraja Sagar Dam, {FN41-2} constructed twelve miles outside
of Mysore. Yoganandaji and I boarded a small bus and, with a small
boy as official cranker or battery substitute, started off over a
smooth dirt road, just as the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t14 t23 t25 t28 hoverable">sun</span> was setting on the horizon and
squashing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> an overripe tomato.

a line of comforting banyan trees, in between a grove of towering

with an immense artificial lake, reflecting the stars and fringe
of palms and other trees, surrounded by lovely terraced gardens
and a row of electric lights on the brink of the dam-and below
it our eyes met a dazzling spectacle of colored beams playing on
geyserlike fountains, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> so <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> streams of brilliant ink pouring

<span class="t22 hoverable">bring</span> Yoganandaji back to America.

"Another rare privilege-my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> elephant ride. Yesterday the

his elephants, an enormous beast. I mounted a ladder provided to
climb aloft to the HOWDAH or saddle, which is silk-cushioned and

into a gully, too <span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">much</span> thrilled to worry or exclaim, but hanging

Southern India, rich with historical and archaeological remains,
is a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">land</span> of definite and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> indefinable charm. To the north of
Mysore is the largest native state in India, Hyderabad, a picturesque
plateau cut by the mighty Godavari River. Broad fertile plains,
the lovely Nilgiris or "Blue Mountains," other regions with barren
hills of limestone or granite. Hyderabad history is a long, colorful
story, starting <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> thousand <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span> ago under the Andhra kings,
and continuing under Hindu dynasties until A.D. 1294, when it passed
to a line of Moslem rulers who reign to this day.

The most breath-taking display of architecture, sculpture, and painting
in all India is <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> at Hyderabad in the ancient rock-sculptured
caves of Ellora and Ajanta. The Kailasa at Ellora, a huge monolithic
temple, possesses carved figures of gods, men, and beasts in the
stupendous proportions of a Michelangelo. Ajanta is the site of
five cathedrals and twenty-five monasteries, all rock excavations

maintained by tremendous frescoed pillars on which artists and
sculptors have immortalized their genius.

Hyderabad <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t22 t23 hoverable">City</span> is graced by the Osmania University and by the
imposing Mecca Masjid Mosque, where ten thousand Mohammedans <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span>

Mysore State too is a scenic wonderland, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> thousand feet above

Hindu architecture and sculpture achieved their <span class="t6 t9 t22 t29 hoverable">highest</span> perfection
in Mysore under the patronage of Hindu kings from the eleventh to

Asoka was a grandson of the formidable Chandragupta Maurya (known
to the Greeks as Sandrocottus), who in his youth had met Alexander
the Great. Later Chandragupta destroyed the Macedonian garrisons
left in India, defeated the invading Greek army of Seleucus in the
Punjab, and then received at his Patna court the Hellenic ambassador
Megasthenes.

Intensely interesting stories have been minutely recorded by Greek
historians and <span class="t1 t7 t13 hoverable">others</span> who accompanied or followed after Alexander
in his expedition to India. The narratives of Arrian, Diodoros,
Plutarch, and Strabo the geographer have been translated by Dr. J.
W. M'Crindle {FN41-3} to throw a shaft of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> on ancient India.

The most admirable feature of Alexander's unsuccessful invasion
was the deep interest he displayed in Hindu philosophy and in the
yogis and <span class="t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t12 t15 t19 t20 t23 t25 hoverable">holy</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> whom he encountered from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> and <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whose</span>
society he eagerly sought. Shortly after the Greek warrior had
arrived in Taxila in northern India, he sent a messenger, Onesikritos,
a disciple of the Hellenic school of Diogenes, to fetch an Indian
teacher, Dandamis, a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> sannyasi of Taxila.

"Hail to thee, O teacher of Brahmins!" Onesikritos <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> after
seeking out Dandamis in his forest retreat. "The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> of the mighty

The yogi received this fairly compulsive invitation calmly, and
"did not so <span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">much</span> as lift up his head from his couch of leaves."

"I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> am a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> of Zeus, if Alexander be such," he commented.
"I want <span class="t15 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">nothing</span> that is Alexander's, for I am content with what I

for no advantage, and is <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> coming to an <span class="t7 t10 t15 t25 hoverable">end</span> of his wanderings.

"Go and tell Alexander that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> the Supreme <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span> is <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> the Author

no wars.

"Alexander is no god, since he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> taste of death," continued the
sage in quiet scorn. "How can such as he be the world's master,
when he has not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> seated himself on a throne of inner universal

the earth, while the nations on its boundaries have not so <span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">much</span> as
heard his name!"

After this chastisement, surely the most caustic <span class="t29 hoverable">ever</span> sent to assault
the ears of the "Lord of the World," the sage added ironically,
"If Alexander's present dominions be not capacious enough for
his desires, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">let</span> him cross the Ganges River; there he will find a
region able to sustain all his men, if the country on this side be
too narrow to hold him. {FN41-4}

"Know this, however, that what Alexander offers and the gifts he
promises are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> to me utterly useless; the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> I prize and

"Let Alexander then terrify with these threats those who wish for
wealth and who dread death, for against us these weapons are both
alike powerless; the Brahmins <span class="t4 t18 t22 hoverable">neither</span> <span class="t7 hoverable">love</span> gold nor fear death. Go
then and tell Alexander this: Dandamis has no need of aught that is

With close attention Alexander received through Onesikritos the
message from the yogi, and "felt a stronger desire than <span class="t29 hoverable">ever</span> to

Alexander invited to Taxila a number of Brahmin ascetics noted for
their skill in answering philosophical questions with pithy wisdom.
An account of the verbal skirmish is <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> by Plutarch; Alexander
himself framed all the questions.

"Which be the more numerous, the living or the dead?"

"The living, for the dead are not."

"Which breeds the larger animals, the sea or the land?"

MAHABHARATA declares, "character and conduct only can decide."
{FN41-9} Manu instructed society to show respect to its members
insofar as they possessed wisdom, virtue, age, kinship or, lastly,
wealth. Riches in Vedic India were always despised if they were
hoarded or unavailable for charitable purposes. Ungenerous <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> of

Serious evils arose when the caste system became hardened through
the centuries into a hereditary halter. Social reformers <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span>
Gandhi and the members of very numerous societies in India today
are making slow but sure progress in restoring the ancient values
of caste, based solely on natural qualification and not on birth.

So entrancing is southern India that Mr. Wright and I yearned to
prolong our idyl. But time, in its immemorial rudeness, dealt us no
courteous extensions. I was scheduled soon to address the concluding
session of the Indian Philosophical Congress at Calcutta University.
At the <span class="t7 t10 t15 t25 hoverable">end</span> of the visit to Mysore, I enjoyed a talk with Sir C. V.
Raman, president of the Indian Academy of Sciences. This brilliant

Hindu physicist was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1930 for his important
discovery in the diffusion of light-the "Raman Effect" now <span class="t6 t10 t15 hoverable">known</span>

Waving a reluctant farewell to a crowd of Madras students and
friends, Mr. Wright and I <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t15 t17 t18 t19 hoverable">set</span> out for the north. On the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> we

seen to be carried <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">away</span> by a sudden flood. Weeks later he was <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span>
buried deep beneath a mound of earth. As the villagers' shovels
struck his body, the saint rose and walked briskly away.

Sadasiva <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> spoke a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">word</span> or wore a cloth. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">One</span> morning the nude
yogi unceremoniously entered the tent of a Mohammedan chieftain. His
ladies screamed in alarm; the warrior dealt a savage sword thrust
at Sadasiva, <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whose</span> arm was severed. The <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">master</span> departed unconcernedly.
Overcome by remorse, the Mohammedan picked up the arm from the floor
and followed Sadasiva. The yogi quietly inserted his arm into the

bleeding stump. When the warrior humbly asked for some <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span>
instruction, Sadasiva wrote with his finger on the sands:

"Do not do what you want, and then you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> do what you like."

The Mohammedan was uplifted to an exalted state of mind, and
understood the saint's paradoxical advice to be a guide to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span>

indicated to the little ones that they should touch his body. Lo!
instantly the <span class="t3 t5 t7 t9 t20 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> group was transported to Madura. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">children</span>

the yogi <span class="t2 t4 t5 t22 t23 hoverable">brought</span> his small charges home by his simple mode of
transportation. The astonished parents heard the vivid tales of the
procession of images, and noted that several <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">children</span> were carrying
bags of Madura sweets.

An incredulous youth derided the saint and the story. The following
morning he approached Sadasiva.

"Master," he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> scornfully, "why don't you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">take</span> me to the festival,

distant <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t22 t23 hoverable">city</span> throng. But alas! where was the saint when the youth
wanted to leave? The weary boy reached his home by the ancient and
prosaic method of foot locomotion.

Of course <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> being has all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> GUNAS in varying
proportions. The guru will be able rightly to determine a man's
caste or evolutionary status.

"To a <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> extent, all races and nations observe in practice, if
not in theory, the features of caste. Where there is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> license

The PURANA SAMHITA compares the offspring of such unions to barren
hybrids, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> the mule which is incapable of propagation of its own

any living representatives. The caste system of India is credited
by her most profound thinkers with being the check or preventive
against license which has preserved the purity of the race and
<span class="t2 t4 t5 t22 t23 hoverable">brought</span> it safely through millenniums of vicissitudes, while other
races have vanished in oblivion."

CHAPTER: 42

LAST <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t11 t20 t26 t27 hoverable">DAYS</span> WITH MY GURU

"Guruji, I am glad to find you alone this morning." I had just
arrived at the Serampore hermitage, carrying a fragrant burden of
fruit and roses. Sri Yukteswar glanced at me meekly.

"What is your question?" <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> looked about the room as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> he
were seeking escape.

"Guruji, I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> to you as a high-school youth; now I am a grown
man, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> with a gray hair or two. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Though</span> you have showered me with
silent affection from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> hour to this, do you realize that
once only, on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> of meeting, have you <span class="t29 hoverable">ever</span> said, 'I <span class="t7 hoverable">love</span> you'?"
I looked at him pleadingly.

<span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> lowered his gaze. "Yogananda, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> I <span class="t22 hoverable">bring</span> out into the cold
realms of speech the warm sentiments best guarded by the wordless
heart?"

"Guruji, I <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">know</span> you <span class="t7 hoverable">love</span> me, but my mortal ears ache to hear you
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">say</span> so."

"Be it as you wish. During my married <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> I often yearned for a
son, to train in the yogic path. But when you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> into my life,
I was content; in you I have <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> my son." <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Two</span> clear teardrops
stood in Sri Yukteswar's eyes. "Yogananda, I <span class="t7 hoverable">love</span> you always."

"Your answer is my passport to heaven." I felt a weight lift from
my heart, dissolved forever at his words. Often had I wondered at
his silence. Realizing that he was unemotional and self-contained,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> sometimes I feared I had been unsuccessful in fully satisfying
him. His was a strange nature, <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> utterly to be known; a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span>
deep and still, unfathomable to the outer world, <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whose</span> values he
had <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> transcended.

A few <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t11 t20 t26 t27 hoverable">days</span> later, when I spoke before a huge audience at Albert
Hall in Calcutta, Sri Yukteswar consented to sit beside me on the
platform, with the Maharaja of Santosh and the Mayor of Calcutta.
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Though</span> <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> no remark to me, I glanced at him from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> to
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> during my address, and <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> I detected a pleased twinkle
in his eyes.

Then <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> a talk before the alumni of Serampore College. As I gazed
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> my <span class="t25 hoverable">old</span> classmates, and as they gazed on their own "Mad Monk,"

tears of joy showed unashamedly. My silver-tongued professor of
philosophy, Dr. Ghoshal, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> forward to greet me, all our past
misunderstandings dissolved by the alchemist Time.

A Winter Solstice Festival was celebrated at the <span class="t7 t10 t15 t25 hoverable">end</span> of December
in the Serampore hermitage. As always, Sri Yukteswar's disciples
gathered from <span class="t6 t9 t18 t26 hoverable">far</span> and near. Devotional SANKIRTANS, solos in the
nectar-sweet voice of Kristo-da, a feast served by young disciples,
Master's profoundly moving discourse under the stars in the thronged
courtyard of the ashram-memories, memories! Joyous festivals of
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span> <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> past! Tonight, however, there was to be a <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> feature.

"Yogananda, please address the assemblage-in English." Master's
eyes were twinkling as he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> this doubly unusual request; was he
thinking of the shipboard predicament that had preceded my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span>
lecture in English? I told the story to my audience of brother
disciples, ending with a fervent tribute to our guru.

"His omnipresent guidance was with me not alone on the ocean
steamer," I concluded, "but daily throughout my fifteen <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span> in
the vast and hospitable <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">land</span> of America."

After the guests had departed, Sri Yukteswar <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> me to the same
bedroom where-once only, after a festival of my early years-I had
been permitted to sleep on his wooden bed. Tonight my guru was

sitting there quietly, a semicircle of disciples at his feet. He
smiled as I quickly entered the room.

"Yogananda, are you leaving now for Calcutta? Please return here
tomorrow. I have <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> to tell you."

The next afternoon, with a few simple <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">words</span> of blessing, Sri Yukteswar
bestowed on me the further monastic title of PARAMHANSA. {FN42-1}

"It now formally supersedes your former title of SWAMI," he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> as
I knelt before him. With a silent chuckle I <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> of the struggle
which my American students <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> undergo over the pronunciation of
PARAMHANSAJI. {FN42-2}

"My task on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> is now finished; you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> carry on." <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span>
spoke quietly, his eyes calm and gentle. My <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t16 t19 t22 t23 t25 t26 hoverable">heart</span> was palpitating
in fear.

"Please send someone to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">take</span> charge of our ashram at Puri," Sri
Yukteswar <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> on. "I leave everything in your hands. You will be
able to successfully sail the boat of your <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> and that of the
organization to the <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> shores."

In tears, I was embracing his feet; he rose and blessed me endearingly.

The following <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> I summoned from Ranchi a disciple, Swami Sebananda,
and sent him to Puri to assume the hermitage duties. {FN42-3}
Later my guru discussed with me the legal details of settling his
estate; he was anxious to prevent the possibility of litigation by
relatives, after his death, for possession of his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> hermitages
and other properties, which he wished to be deeded over solely for
charitable purposes.

"Arrangements were recently <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> for <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> to visit Kidderpore,

To my pressing inquiries, Sri Yukteswar only replied, "I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span>

Patanjali wrote, {FN42-5} "is present in slight degree <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>

to add: "Just as a long-caged bird hesitates to leave its accustomed
home when the door is opened.")

"Guruji," I entreated him with a sob, "don't <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">say</span> that! <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">Never</span> utter

Sri Yukteswar's face relaxed in a peaceful smile. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Though</span> nearing

"Sir, the KUMBHA MELA is convening this month at Allahabad." I
showed <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> the MELA dates in a Bengali almanac. {FN42-6}

"Do you really want to go?"

Not sensing Sri Yukteswar's reluctance to have me leave him, I <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span>

"I do not think you will meet him there." My guru then fell into
silence, not wishing to obstruct my plans.

When I <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t15 t17 t18 t19 hoverable">set</span> out for Allahabad the following <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> with a small group,
<span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> blessed me quietly in his usual manner. Apparently I was
remaining oblivious to implications in Sri Yukteswar's attitude
because the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> wished to spare me the experience of being forced,
helplessly, to witness my guru's passing. It has always happened in

my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> that, at the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> of those dearly beloved by me, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> has
compassionately arranged that I be distant from the scene. {FN42-7}

Our party reached the KUMBHA MELA on January 23, 1936. The surging
crowd of nearly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> million persons was an impressive sight, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span>
an overwhelming one. The peculiar genius of the Indian <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> is
the reverence innate in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> the lowliest peasant for the worth of
the Spirit, and for the monks and sadhus who have forsaken worldly
ties to seek a diviner anchorage. Imposters and hypocrites there
are indeed, but India respects all for the sake of the few who
illumine the <span class="t3 t5 t7 t9 t20 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">land</span> with supernal blessings. Westerners who
were viewing the vast spectacle had a unique opportunity to feel
the pulse of the land, the <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> ardor to which India owes her
quenchless vitality before the blows of time.

The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> was spent by our group in sheer staring. Here were
countless bathers, dipping in the <span class="t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t12 t15 t19 t20 t23 t25 hoverable">holy</span> river for remission of sins;
there we saw solemn rituals of worship; yonder were devotional
offerings being strewn at the dusty feet of saints; a turn of our
heads, and a line of elephants, caparisoned horses and slow-paced
Rajputana camels filed by, or a quaint religious parade of naked
sadhus, waving scepters of gold and silver, or flags and streamers
of silken velvet.

Anchorites wearing only loincloths sat quietly in little groups,
their bodies besmeared with the ashes that protect them from the
heat and cold. The <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> eye was vividly represented on their
foreheads by a single spot of sandalwood paste. Shaven-headed swamis
appeared by the thousands, ocher-robed and carrying their bamboo
staff and begging bowl. Their faces beamed with the renunciate's
peace as they walked about or held philosophical discussions with
disciples.

Here and there under the trees, around huge piles of burning logs,
were picturesque sadhus, {FN42-8} their hair braided and massed in
coils on top of their heads. Some wore beards several feet in length,

curled and tied in a knot. They meditated quietly, or extended
their hands in blessing to the passing throng-beggars, maharajas on
elephants, women in multicolored SARIS--their bangles and anklets
tinkling, FAKIRS with thin arms held grotesquely aloft, BRAHMACHARIS
carrying meditation elbow-props, humble sages <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whose</span> solemnity hid
an inner bliss. High above the din we heard the ceaseless summons
of the temple bells.

On our <span class="t6 hoverable">second</span> MELA <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> my companions and I entered various ashrams
and temporary huts, offering PRONAMS to saintly personages. We
received the blessing of the leader of the GIRI branch of the Swami
Order-a thin, ascetical monk with eyes of smiling fire. Our next
visit <span class="t4 hoverable">took</span> us to a hermitage <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whose</span> guru had observed for the past
nine <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span> the vows of silence and a strict fruitarian diet. On the
central dais in the ashram hall sat a blind sadhu, Pragla Chakshu,
profoundly learned in the SHASTRAS and highly revered by all sects.

After I had <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> a brief discourse in Hindi on VEDANTA, our group
left the peaceful hermitage to greet a near-by swami, Krishnananda,
a handsome monk with rosy cheeks and impressive shoulders. Reclining
near him was a tame lioness. Succumbing to the monk's <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span>
charm--not, I am sure, to his powerful physique!-the jungle animal
refuses all meat in favor of rice and milk. The swami has taught
the tawny-haired beast to utter "AUM" in a deep, attractive growl-a
cat devotee!

Our next encounter, an interview with a learned young sadhu, is
<span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t8 t10 t12 t13 t14 t17 t19 t23 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> described in Mr. Wright's sparkling travel diary.

"We rode in the Ford across the very low Ganges on a creaking
pontoon bridge, crawling snakelike through the crowds and over
narrow, twisting lanes, passing the site on the river bank which
Yoganandaji pointed out to me as the meeting <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> of Babaji and
Sri Yukteswarji. Alighting from the car a short <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> later, we
walked some distance through the thickening smoke of the sadhus'
fires and over the slippery sands to reach a cluster of tiny,
very modest mud-and-straw huts. We halted in front of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of these
insignificant temporary dwellings, with a pygmy doorless entrance,
the shelter of Kara Patri, a young wandering sadhu noted for his
exceptional intelligence. There he sat, cross-legged on a pile of
straw, his only covering-and incidentally his only possession-being
an ocher cloth draped over his shoulders.

"Truly a <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> face smiled at us after we had crawled on all fours
into the hut and PRONAMED at the feet of this enlightened soul,
while the kerosene lantern at the entrance flickered weird, dancing
shadows on the thatched walls. His face, especially his eyes
and perfect teeth, beamed and glistened. Although I was puzzled
by the Hindi, his expressions were very revealing; he was full of
enthusiasm, love, <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> glory. No <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> be mistaken as to

his greatness.

"Imagine the happy <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> unattached to the material world;

"Such a modest soul! unusually learned in the VEDAS, and possessing
an M.A. degree and the title of SHASTRI (master of scriptures) from
Benares University. A sublime feeling pervaded me as I sat at his
feet; it all seemed to be an answer to my desire to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> the real,
the ancient India, for he is a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> representative of this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">land</span> of
<span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> giants."

I questioned Kara Patri about his wandering life. "Don't you have
any extra clothes for winter?"

"No, this is enough."

"Do you carry any books?"

"No, I teach from memory those <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> who wish to hear me."

"What else do you do?"

"I roam by the Ganges."

At these quiet words, I was overpowered by a yearning for the simplicity
of his life. I remembered America, and all the responsibilities
that lay on my shoulders.

"No, Yogananda," I thought, sadly for a moment, "in this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span>
roaming by the Ganges is not for you."

After the sadhu had told me a few of his <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> realizations,
I shot an abrupt question.

"Are you giving these descriptions from scriptural lore, or from
inward experience?"

"Half from <span class="t25 hoverable">book</span> learning," he answered with a straightforward smile,
"and half from experience."

We sat happily awhile in meditative silence. After we had left his
sacred presence, I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to Mr. Wright, "He is a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> sitting on a
throne of golden straw."

We had our dinner that night on the MELA grounds under the stars,
eating from leaf plates pinned <span class="t16 t21 hoverable">together</span> with sticks. Dishwashings
in India are reduced to a minimum!

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Two</span> more <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t11 t20 t26 t27 hoverable">days</span> of the fascinating KUMBHA; then northwest along the
Jumna banks to Agra. Once again I gazed on the Taj Mahal; in memory
Jitendra stood by my side, awed by the dream in marble. Then on to
the Brindaban ashram of Swami Keshabananda.

My object in seeking out Keshabananda was connected with this book.
I had <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> forgotten Sri Yukteswar's request that I write the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span>
of Lahiri Mahasaya. During my stay in India I was taking <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span>
opportunity of contacting direct disciples and relatives of the
Yogavatar. Recording their conversations in voluminous notes, I
verified facts and dates, and collected photographs, <span class="t25 hoverable">old</span> letters,
and documents. My Lahiri Mahasaya portfolio began to swell; I realized
with dismay that ahead of me lay arduous labors in authorship.
I prayed that I <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t18 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">might</span> be equal to my role as biographer of the
colossal guru. Several of his disciples feared that in a <span class="t23 hoverable">written</span>
account their <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">master</span> <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t18 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">might</span> be belittled or misinterpreted.

"One can hardly do justice in cold <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">words</span> to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of a <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span>
incarnation," Panchanon Bhattacharya had once remarked to me.

Other close disciples were similarly satisfied to keep the Yogavatar
hidden in their hearts as the deathless preceptor. Nevertheless,
mindful of Lahiri Mahasaya's prediction about his biography, I spared
no effort to secure and substantiate the facts of his outward life.

Swami Keshabananda greeted our party warmly at Brindaban in his
Katayani Peith Ashram, an imposing brick building with massive
black pillars, <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t15 t17 t18 t19 hoverable">set</span> in a beautiful garden. He ushered us at once
into a sitting room adorned with an enlargement of Lahiri Mahasaya's
picture. The swami was approaching the age of ninety, but his
muscular <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> radiated strength and health. With <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> hair and
a snow-white beard, eyes twinkling with joy, he was a veritable
patriarchal embodiment. I informed him that I wanted to mention
his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> in my <span class="t25 hoverable">book</span> on India's masters.

"Please tell me about your earlier life." I smiled entreatingly;
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> yogis are often uncommunicative.

Keshabananda <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> a gesture of humility. "There is little of external
moment. Practically my <span class="t3 t5 t7 t9 t20 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> has been spent in the Himalayan
solitudes, traveling on foot from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> quiet cave to another. For
a while I maintained a small ashram outside Hardwar, surrounded on
all sides by a grove of tall trees. It was a peaceful spot little
visited by travelers, owing to the ubiquitous presence of cobras."
Keshabananda chuckled. "Later a Ganges flood washed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">away</span> the

hermitage and cobras alike. My disciples then helped me to build
this Brindaban ashram."

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">One</span> of our party asked the swami how he had protected himself
against the Himalayan tigers. {FN42-9}

Keshabananda shook his head. "In those high <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> altitudes,"
he said, "wild beasts seldom molest the yogis. Once in the jungle
I encountered a tiger face-to-face. At my sudden ejaculation, the
animal was transfixed as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> turned to stone." Again the swami
chuckled at his memories.

"Occasionally I left my seclusion to visit my guru in Benares. He
<span class="t27 hoverable">used</span> to joke with me over my ceaseless travels in the Himalayan
wilderness.

"'You have the mark of wanderlust on your foot,' he told me once.
'I am glad that the sacred Himalayas are extensive enough to engross

"Many times," Keshabananda <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> on, "both before and after his
passing, Lahiri Mahasaya has appeared bodily before me. For him no
Himalayan height is inaccessible!"

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Two</span> hours later he led us to a dining patio. I sighed in silent

After dinner, Keshabananda led me to a secluded nook.

"Your arrival is not unexpected," he said. "I have a message for
you."

I was surprised; no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> had <span class="t6 t10 t15 hoverable">known</span> of my plan to visit Keshabananda.

"While roaming last year in the northern Himalayas near Badrinarayan,"

the swami continued, "I lost my way. Shelter appeared in a spacious
cave, which was empty, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> the embers of a <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> glowed in a hole
in the rocky floor. Wondering about the occupant of this lonely
retreat, I sat near the fire, my gaze fixed on the sunlit entrance
to the cave.

"'Keshabananda, I am glad you are here.' These <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">words</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> from

Overjoyed to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> him again after <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> years, I prostrated myself
at his <span class="t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t12 t15 t19 t20 t23 t25 hoverable">holy</span> feet.

"The deathless <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">master</span> blessed me with some <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">words</span> of <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> help,
then added: 'I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> you a message for Yogananda. He will pay you a

I was deeply touched to receive from Keshabananda's lips this
consoling promise from Babaji. A <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> hurt in my <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t16 t19 t22 t23 t25 t26 hoverable">heart</span> vanished;

I grieved no longer that, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> as Sri Yukteswar had hinted, Babaji
did not appear at the KUMBHA MELA.

following afternoon for Calcutta. Riding over a bridge of the Jumna
River, we enjoyed a magnificent view of the skyline of Brindaban
just as the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t14 t23 t25 t28 hoverable">sun</span> <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t15 t17 t18 t19 hoverable">set</span> <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> to the sky-a veritable furnace of Vulcan
in color, reflected below us in the still waters.

The Jumna beach is hallowed by memories of the child Sri Krishna.
Here he engaged with innocent sweetness in his LILAS (plays)
with the GOPIS (maids), exemplifying the supernal <span class="t7 hoverable">love</span> which <span class="t29 hoverable">ever</span>
exists between a <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> incarnation and his devotees. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of

Scriptural allegory is baffling to literal minds. A hilarious blunder
by a translator will illustrate this point. The story concerns an
inspired medieval saint, the cobbler Ravidas, who sang in the simple
terms of his own trade of the <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> glory hidden in all mankind:

Under the vast vault of blue
Lives the divinity clothed in hide.

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">One</span> turns aside to hide a smile on hearing the pedestrian interpretation

"He afterwards built a hut, <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t15 t17 t18 t19 hoverable">set</span> up in it an idol which he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> from
a hide, and applied himself to its worship."

Ravidas was a brother disciple of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Kabir. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">One</span> of Ravidas'
exalted chelas was the Rani of Chitor. She invited a large number
of Brahmins to a feast in honor of her teacher, but they refused to
eat with a lowly cobbler. As they sat down in dignified aloofness
to eat their own uncontaminated meal, lo! each Brahmin <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> at his
side the <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of Ravidas. This mass vision accomplished a widespread
<span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> revival in Chitor.

In a few <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t11 t20 t26 t27 hoverable">days</span> our little group reached Calcutta. Eager to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> Sri
Yukteswar, I was disappointed to hear that he had left Serampore
and was now in Puri, about <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> hundred miles to the south.

"Come to Puri ashram at once." This telegram was sent on March 8th
by a brother disciple to Atul Chandra Roy Chowdhry, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of Master's
chelas in Calcutta. News of the message reached my ears; anguished
at its implications, I dropped to my knees and implored <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> that

for the train, a <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> voice spoke within.

"Do not go to Puri tonight. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thy</span> prayer <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">cannot</span> he granted."

"Lord," I said, grief-stricken, "Thou dost not wish to engage

with me in a 'tug of war' at Puri, where <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thou</span> wilt have to deny
my incessant prayers for Master's life. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">Must</span> he, then, depart for
higher duties at <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thy</span> behest?"

In obedience to the inward command, I did not leave that night for
Puri. The following evening I <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t15 t17 t18 t19 hoverable">set</span> out for the train; on the way,
at seven o'clock, a black astral cloud suddenly covered the sky.
{FN42-11} Later, while the train roared toward Puri, a vision of
Sri Yukteswar appeared before me. He was sitting, very grave of
countenance, with a <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> on each side.

"Is it all over?" I lifted my arms beseechingly.

He nodded, then slowly vanished.

As I stood on the Puri train platform the following morning, still
hoping against hope, an unknown <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> approached me.

"Have you heard that your <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> is gone?" He left me <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">another</span>
word; I <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> discovered who he was nor how he had <span class="t6 t10 t15 hoverable">known</span> where to
find me.

Stunned, I swayed against the platform wall, realizing that in
diverse ways my guru was trying to convey to me the devastating
news. Seething with rebellion, my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> a volcano. By the

time I reached the Puri hermitage I was nearing collapse. The inner
voice was tenderly repeating: "Collect yourself. Be calm."

I entered the ashram room where Master's body, unimaginably lifelike,
was sitting in the lotus posture-a picture of health and loveliness.
A short <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> before his passing, my guru had been slightly ill with
fever, but before the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> of his ascension into the Infinite, his

his dear <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> not realize that its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> had departed. His
skin was smooth and soft; in his face was a beatific expression of
tranquillity. He had consciously relinquished his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> at the hour
of mystic summoning.

"The Lion of Bengal is gone!" I cried in a daze.

I conducted the solemn rites on March 10th. Sri Yukteswar was buried
{FN42-12} with the ancient rituals of the swamis in the garden of
his Puri ashram. His disciples later arrived from <span class="t6 t9 t18 t26 hoverable">far</span> and near to
honor their guru at a vernal equinox memorial service. The AMRITA
BAZAR PATRIKA, leading newspaper of Calcutta, carried his picture
and the following report:

One of the greatest expounders of the BHAGAVAD GITA, Swami Maharaj
was a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> disciple of Yogiraj Sri Shyama Charan Lahiri Mahasaya
of Benares. Swami Maharaj was the founder of several Yogoda Sat-Sanga
(Self-Realization Fellowship) centers in India, and was the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>
inspiration behind the yoga movement which was carried to the West
by Swami Yogananda, his principal disciple. It was Sri Yukteswarji's
prophetic powers and deep realization that inspired Swami Yogananda
to cross the oceans and spread in America the message of the masters
of India.

His interpretations of the BHAGAVAD GITA and other scriptures testify
to the depth of Sri Yukteswarji's command of the philosophy, both
Eastern and Western, and remain as an eye-opener for the unity
between Orient and Occident. As he believed in the unity of all
religious faiths, Sri Yukteswar Maharaj established SADHU SABHA
(Society of Saints) with the cooperation of leaders of various
sects and faiths, for the inculcation of a scientific <span class="t0 t1 t3 t5 t7 t8 t13 t16 t18 t20 t21 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> in
religion. At the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of his demise he nominated Swami Yogananda
his successor as the president of SADHU SABHA.

India is really poorer today by the passing of such a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> man. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">May</span>
all fortunate enough to have <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> near him inculcate in themselves

in him.

I returned to Calcutta. Not trusting myself as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> to go to the
Serampore hermitage with its sacred memories, I summoned Prafulla,
Sri Yukteswar's little disciple in Serampore, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> arrangements
for him to enter the Ranchi school.

"The morning you left for the Allahabad MELA," Prafulla told me,
"Master dropped heavily on the davenport.

"'Yogananda is gone!' he cried. 'Yogananda is gone!' He added
cryptically, 'I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> have to tell him some other way.' He sat then
for hours in silence."

My <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t11 t20 t26 t27 hoverable">days</span> were filled with lectures, classes, interviews, and reunions
with <span class="t25 hoverable">old</span> friends. Beneath a hollow smile and a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of ceaseless
activity, a stream of black brooding polluted the inner river of
bliss which for so <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span> had meandered under the sands of all
my perceptions.

"Where has that <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> sage gone?" I cried silently from the depths
of a tormented spirit.

No answer came.

"It is best that <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> has completed his union with the Cosmic

Beloved," my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> assured me. "He is eternally glowing in the
dominion of deathlessness."

"Never again <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> him in the <span class="t25 hoverable">old</span> Serampore mansion," my
<span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t16 t19 t22 t23 t25 t26 hoverable">heart</span> lamented. "No longer <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> you <span class="t22 hoverable">bring</span> your friends to meet him,

Mr. Wright <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> arrangements for our party to sail from Bombay
for the West in early June. After a fortnight in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">May</span> of farewell
banquets and speeches at Calcutta, Miss Bletch, Mr. Wright and myself
left in the Ford for Bombay. On our arrival, the ship authorities
asked us to cancel our passage, as no room <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> be <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> for the

"Never mind," I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> gloomily to Mr. Wright. "I want to return once
more to Puri." I silently added, "Let my tears once again <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span>

{FN42-5} APHORISMS: II:9.

{FN42-6} Religious MELAS are mentioned in the ancient MAHABHARATA.
The Chinese traveler Hieuen Tsiang has left an account of a vast
KUMBHA MELA held in A.D. 644 at Allahabad. The largest MELA is held
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> twelfth year; the next largest (ARDHA or half) KUMBHA occurs
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> sixth year. Smaller MELAS convene <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> third year, attracting
about a million devotees. The four sacred MELA cities are Allahabad,
Hardwar, Nasik, and Ujjain.

Early Chinese travelers have left us <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> striking pictures of
Indian society. The Chinese priest, Fa-Hsien, wrote an account of
his eleven <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span> in India during the reign of Chandragupta II (early
4th century). The Chinese author relates: "Throughout the country
no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> kills any living thing, nor drinks wine. . . . They do not

keep pigs or fowl; there are no dealings in cattle, no butchers'
shops or distilleries. Rooms with beds and mattresses, food and
clothes, are provided for resident and traveling priests <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> fail,
and this is the same in all places. The priests occupy themselves
with benevolent ministrations and with chanting liturgies; or they
sit in meditation." Fa-Hsien tells us the Indian <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> were happy
and honest; capital punishment was unknown.

{FN42-7} I was not present at the deaths of my mother, elder
brother Ananta, eldest sister Roma, Master, Father, or of several
close disciples.

(Father passed on at Calcutta in 1942, at the age of eighty-nine.)

{FN42-8} The hundreds of thousands of Indian sadhus are controlled
by an executive committee of seven leaders, representing seven
large sections of India. The present MAHAMANDALESWAR or president
is Joyendra Puri. This saintly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> is extremely reserved, often
confining his speech to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> words-Truth, Love, and Work. A
sufficient conversation!

{FN42-9} There are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> methods, it appears, for outwitting a
tiger. An Australian explorer, Francis Birtles, has recounted that
he <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> the Indian jungles "varied, beautiful, and safe." His
safety charm was flypaper. "Every night I spread a quantity of

sheets around my camp and was <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> disturbed," he explained. "The
reason is psychological. The tiger is an animal of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> conscious
dignity. He prowls around and challenges <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> until he comes to the
flypaper; he then slinks away. No dignified tiger <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> dare face

{FN42-10} After I returned to America I <span class="t4 hoverable">took</span> off sixty-five pounds.

{FN42-11} Sri Yukteswar passed at this hour-7:00 P.M., March 9,
1936.

{FN42-12} Funeral customs in India require cremation for householders;
swamis and monks of other orders are not cremated, but buried. (There
are occasional exceptions.) The bodies of monks are symbolically
considered to have undergone cremation in the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> of wisdom at

CHAPTER: 43

THE RESURRECTION OF SRI YUKTESWAR

"Lord Krishna!" The glorious <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of the avatar appeared in a

shimmering blaze as I sat in my room at the Regent Hotel in Bombay.
Shining over the roof of a high building across the street, the
ineffable vision had suddenly burst on my sight as I gazed out of
my <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> open third-story window.

The <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> figure waved to me, smiling and nodding in greeting.
When I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> not understand the exact message of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> Krishna, he
departed with a gesture of blessing. Wondrously uplifted, I felt
that some <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> event was presaged.

My Western voyage had, for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> being, been cancelled. I was
scheduled for several public addresses in Bombay before leaving on
a return visit to Bengal.

Sitting on my bed in the Bombay hotel at <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> o'clock in the
afternoon of June 19, 1936-one week after the vision of Krishna-I
was roused from my meditation by a beatific light. Before my open
and astonished eyes, the <span class="t3 t5 t7 t9 t20 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> room was transformed into a strange
world, the sunlight transmuted into supernal splendor.

Waves of rapture engulfed me as I beheld the flesh and blood <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span>
of Sri Yukteswar!

"My son!" <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> spoke tenderly, on his face an angel-bewitching
smile.

For the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> in my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> I did not kneel at his feet in
greeting but instantly advanced to gather him hungrily in my arms.
Moment of moments! The anguish of past months was toll I counted
weightless against the torrential bliss now descending.

"Master mine, beloved of my heart, why did you leave me?" I was
incoherent in an excess of joy. "Why did you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">let</span> me go to the KUMBHA
MELA? How bitterly have I blamed myself for leaving you!"

affect their bodies by lifetronic force or by MANTRIC vibrations.

"The astral <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> is an exact counterpart of the last physical form.
Astral beings retain the same appearance which they possessed in
youth in their previous earthly sojourn; occasionally an astral
being chooses, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> myself, to retain his <span class="t25 hoverable">old</span> age appearance."
Master, emanating the very essence of youth, chuckled merrily.

"Unlike the spacial, three-dimensional physical <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> cognized

sheer intuitional feeling, all astral beings see, hear, smell,
taste, and touch.

"Man's physical <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> is exposed to countless dangers, and is easily

"Gurudeva, are all astral persons beautiful?"

"Beauty in the astral <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> is <span class="t6 t10 t15 hoverable">known</span> to be a <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> quality,

Heavenly Father, and the saints who are merged in Him, materialize
Themselves into bodies of Their own choice and join the astral

delusive partings of earthly life.

"The intuition of astral beings pierces through the veil and

of earth-dwellers have momentarily glimpsed an astral being or an

problems of cosmic government and the redemption of prodigal
sons, earthbound souls. When the Hiranyaloka beings sleep, they
have occasional dreamlike astral visions. Their minds are usually
engrossed in the conscious state of <span class="t6 t9 t22 t29 hoverable">highest</span> NIRBIKALPA bliss.

"Inhabitants in all parts of the astral worlds are still subject

"Master mine, do astral beings eat anything?" I was drinking in his
marvelous elucidations with the receptivity of all my faculties-mind,
heart, soul. Superconscious perceptions of <span class="t3 t7 t9 t10 t15 t19 t22 hoverable">truth</span> are permanently
real and changeless, while fleeting sense experiences and impressions
are <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> more than temporarily or relatively true, and soon lose
in memory all their vividness. My guru's <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">words</span> were so penetratingly

"Luminous raylike vegetables abound in the astral soils," he answered.
"The astral beings consume vegetables, and drink a nectar flowing

I had been lovingly observing Sri Yukteswar while he gave his
wondrous exposition.

"Angelic guru," I said, "your <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> looks exactly as it did when

"Though you move about so fast these days, I had no difficulty in
finding you at Bombay!"

"O Master, I was grieving so deeply about your death!"

"Ah, wherein did I die? Isn't there some contradiction?" Sri
Yukteswar's eyes were twinkling with <span class="t7 hoverable">love</span> and amusement.

"You were only dreaming on earth; on that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> you saw my

This idea of VEDANTIC {FN43-12} resurrection struck me with wonder.

"I have now told you, Yogananda, the truths of my life, death,

Sri Yukteswar gave me <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> on <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> matters which I <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">cannot</span> reveal

"My child," his voice rang out, vibrating into my very soul-firmament,
"whenever you enter the door of NIRBIKALPA SAMADHI and call on me,
I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> to you in flesh and blood, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> as today."

With this celestial promise Sri Yukteswar vanished from my sight.
A cloud-voice repeated in musical thunder: "Tell all! Whosoever
knows by NIRBIKALPA realization that your <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> is a dream of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span>

Yogananda, tell all!"

Gone was the sorrow of parting. The pity and grief for his death,
<span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> robber of my peace, now fled in stark shame. Bliss poured
<span class="t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t9 t10 t11 t13 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">forth</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> a fountain through endless, newly opened soul-pores.
Anciently clogged with disuse, they now widened in purity at the
driving flood of ecstasy. Subconscious thoughts and feelings of my
past incarnations shed their karmic taints, lustrously renewed by
Sri Yukteswar's <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> visit.

In this <span class="t12 t19 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">chapter</span> of my autobiography I have obeyed my guru's behest
and spread the glad tiding, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> it confound once more an incurious

to the dank pessimism of his "dust-thou-art" counselors, heedless
of the unconquerable soul.

I was not the only <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> privileged to <span class="t0 t5 t16 t22 hoverable">behold</span> the Resurrected Guru.

<span class="t6 t10 t15 hoverable">known</span> as MA (Mother), <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whose</span> home was close to the Puri hermitage.
<span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> had often stopped to chat with her during his morning walk.
On the evening of March 16, 1936, Ma arrived at the ashram and
asked to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> her guru.

"Why, <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> died a week ago!" Swami Sebananda, now in charge of
the Puri hermitage, looked at her sadly.

"That's impossible!" She smiled a little. "Perhaps you are just
trying to protect the guru from insistent visitors?"

"No." Sebananda recounted details of the burial. "Come," he said,
"I will <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">take</span> you to the front garden to Sri Yukteswarji's grave."

Ma shook her head. "There is no grave for him! This morning at ten
o'clock he passed in his usual walk before my door! I talked to
him for several minutes in the bright outdoors.

"'Come this evening to the ashram,' he said.

"I am here! Blessings pour on this <span class="t25 hoverable">old</span> gray head! The deathless guru
wanted me to understand in what transcendent <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> he had visited
me this morning!"

The astounded Sebananda knelt before her.

"Ma," he said, "what a weight of grief you lift from my heart! He
is risen!"

{FN43-1} In SABIKALPA SAMADHI the devotee has spiritually progressed
to a state of inward <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> union, but <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">cannot</span> maintain his cosmic

lifetrons. The Hindu scriptures refer not only to the ANU, "atom,"
and to the PARAMANU, "beyond the atom," finer electronic energies;
but <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> to PRANA, "creative lifetronic force." Atoms and electrons
are blind forces; PRANA is inherently intelligent. The pranic
lifetrons in the spermatozoa and ova, for instance, guide the

embryonic development <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">according</span> to a karmic design.

{FN43-3} Adjective of MANTRA, chanted seed-sounds discharged by
the mental gun of concentration. The PURANAS (ancient SHASTRAS or
treatises) describe these MANTRIC wars between DEVAS and ASURAS
(gods and demons). An ASURA once tried to slay a DEVA with a potent
chant. But due to mispronunciation the mental bomb acted as a
boomerang and killed the demon.

{FN43-4} Examples of such powers are not wanting <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> on earth, as

CHAPTER: 44

WITH MAHATMA GANDHI AT WARDHA

"Welcome to Wardha!" Mahadev Desai, secretary to Mahatma Gandhi,
greeted Miss Bletch, Mr. Wright, and myself with these cordial <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">words</span>
and the gift of wreaths of KHADDAR (homespun cotton). Our little
group had just dismounted at the Wardha station on an early morning
in August, glad to leave the dust and heat of the train. Consigning
our luggage to a bullock cart, we entered an open motor car with
Mr. Desai and his companions, Babasaheb Deshmukh and Dr. Pingale.
A short drive over the muddy country roads <span class="t2 t4 t5 t22 t23 hoverable">brought</span> us to MAGANVADI,
the ashram of India's political saint.

Mr. Desai led us at once to the writing room where, cross-legged,
sat Mahatma Gandhi. Pen in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t29 hoverable">hand</span> and a scrap of paper in the
other, on his face a vast, winning, warm-hearted smile!

"Welcome!" he scribbled in Hindi; it was a Monday, his weekly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span>

of silence.

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Though</span> this was our <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> meeting, we beamed on each other
affectionately. In 1925 Mahatma Gandhi had honored the Ranchi school
by a visit, and had inscribed in its guest-book a gracious tribute.

The tiny 100-pound saint radiated physical, mental, and <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span>
health. His soft brown eyes shone with intelligence, sincerity,
and discrimination; this statesman has matched wits and emerged the
victor in a thousand legal, social, and political battles. No other
leader in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> has attained the secure niche in the hearts of
his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> that Gandhi occupies for India's unlettered millions.
Their spontaneous tribute is his famous title-MAHATMA, "great
soul." {FN44-1} For them alone Gandhi confines his attire to the
widely-cartooned loincloth, symbol of his oneness with the downtrodden
masses who can afford no more.

[Illustration: MAHATMA GANDHI, I enjoy a quiet lunch with India's
political saint at his hermitage in Wardha, August, 1935.--see
gandhi.jpg]

"The ashram residents are wholly at your disposal; please call on
them for any service." With characteristic courtesy, the Mahatma
handed me this hastily-written <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t9 t12 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">note</span> as Mr. Desai led our party from
the writing room toward the guest house.

Our guide led us through orchards and flowering fields to
a tile-roofed building with latticed windows. A front-yard well,
twenty-five feet across, was used, Mr. Desai said, for watering
stock; near-by stood a revolving cement wheel for threshing rice.
Each of our small bedrooms proved to contain only the irreducible
minimum-a bed, handmade of rope. The whitewashed kitchen boasted a
faucet in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> corner and a <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> pit for cooking in another. Simple
Arcadian sounds reached our ears-the cries of crows and sparrows,
the lowing of cattle, and the rap of chisels being <span class="t27 hoverable">used</span> to chip
stones.

Observing Mr. Wright's travel diary, Mr. Desai opened a page and
wrote on it a list of SATYAGRAHA {FN44-2} vows <span class="t19 hoverable">taken</span> by all the
Mahatma's strict followers (SATYAGRAHIS):

"Nonviolence; Truth; Non-Stealing; Celibacy; Non-Possession;
Body-Labor; Control of the Palate; Fearlessness; Equal Respect for
all Religions; SWADESHI (use of home manufactures); Freedom from
Untouchability. These eleven should be observed as vows in a <span class="t0 t1 t3 t5 t7 t8 t13 t16 t18 t20 t21 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">spirit</span>
of humility."

(Gandhi himself signed this page on the following day, giving the
date also-August 27, 1935.)

Two hours after our arrival my companions and I were summoned
to lunch. The Mahatma was already seated under the arcade of the
ashram porch, across the courtyard from his study. About twenty-five
barefooted SATYAGRAHIS were squatting before brass cups and plates.
A community chorus of prayer; then a meal served from large brass
pots containing CHAPATIS (whole-wheat unleavened bread) sprinkled
with GHEE; TALSARI (boiled and diced vegetables), and a lemon jam.

The Mahatma ate CHAPATIS, boiled beets, some raw vegetables, and
oranges. On the side of his <span class="t14 hoverable">plate</span> was a large lump of very bitter
NEEM leaves, a notable blood cleanser. With his spoon he separated
a portion and placed it on my dish. I bolted it down with water,
remembering childhood <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t11 t20 t26 t27 hoverable">days</span> when Mother had forced me to swallow the
disagreeable dose. Gandhi, however, bit by bit was eating the NEEM
paste with as <span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">much</span> relish as if it had been a delicious sweetmeat.

In this trifling incident I noted the Mahatma's ability to detach
his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> from the senses at will. I recalled the famous appendectomy
performed on him some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span> ago. Refusing anesthetics, the saint
had chatted cheerfully with his disciples throughout the operation,
his infectious smile revealing his unawareness of pain.

The afternoon <span class="t2 t4 t5 t22 t23 hoverable">brought</span> an opportunity for a chat with Gandhi's noted
disciple, daughter of an English admiral, Miss Madeleine Slade, now
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Mirabai. {FN44-3} Her strong, calm face lit with enthusiasm

as she told me, in flawless Hindi, of her daily activities.

"Rural reconstruction <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t7 t10 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> is rewarding! A group of us go <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span>
morning at five o'clock to serve the near-by villagers and teach
them simple hygiene. We <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> it a point to clean their latrines and
their mud-thatched huts. The villagers are illiterate; they <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">cannot</span>
be educated except by example!" She laughed gaily.

I looked in admiration at this highborn Englishwoman <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whose</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span>
Christian humility enables her to do the scavengering <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t7 t10 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> usually
performed only by "untouchables."

"I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> to India in 1925," she told me. "In this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">land</span> I feel that
I have 'come back home.' Now I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> be willing to return to

We discussed America for awhile. "I am always pleased and amazed,"
she said, "to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> the deep interest in <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> subjects exhibited
by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> Americans who visit India." {FN44-4}

Mirabai's hands were soon busy at the CHARKA (spinning wheel),
omnipresent in all the ashram rooms and, indeed, due to the Mahatma,
omnipresent throughout rural India.

Gandhi has sound economic and cultural reasons for encouraging the

revival of cottage industries, but he does not counsel a fanatical
repudiation of all modern progress. Machinery, trains, automobiles,
the telegraph have played important parts in his own colossal life!
Fifty <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span> of public service, in prison and out, wrestling daily
with practical details and harsh realities in the political world,
have only increased his balance, open-mindedness, sanity, and
humorous appreciation of the quaint <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> spectacle.

Our trio enjoyed a six o'clock supper as guests of Babasaheb Deshmukh.
The 7:00 P.M. prayer hour <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> us back at the MAGANVADI ashram,
climbing to the roof where thirty SATYAGRAHIS were grouped in
a semicircle around Gandhi. He was squatting on a straw mat, an
ancient pocket watch propped up before him. The fading <span class="t0 t8 t11 t14 t23 t25 t28 hoverable">sun</span> cast
a last gleam over the palms and banyans; the hum of night and the
crickets had started. The atmosphere was serenity itself; I was
enraptured.

A solemn chant led by Mr. Desai, with responses from the group; then
a GITA reading. The Mahatma motioned to me to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> the concluding
prayer. Such <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> unison of <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> and aspiration! A memory
forever: the Wardha roof top meditation under the early stars.

Punctually at eight o'clock Gandhi ended his silence. The herculean
labors of his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> require him to apportion his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> minutely.

"Welcome, Swamiji!" The Mahatma's greeting this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> was not via
paper. We had just descended from the roof to his writing room,
simply furnished with square mats (no chairs), a low desk with books,
papers, and a few ordinary pens (not fountain pens); a nondescript
clock ticked in a corner. An all-pervasive aura of peace and
devotion. Gandhi was bestowing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of his captivating, cavernous,
almost toothless smiles.

"Years ago," he explained, "I started my weekly observance
of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> of silence as a <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t14 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">means</span> for gaining <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> to look after my

<span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> need. A periodical decree of silence is not a torture
but a blessing."

I agreed wholeheartedly. {FN44-5} The Mahatma questioned me about
America and Europe; we discussed India and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> conditions.

"Mahadev," Gandhi <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> as Mr. Desai entered the room, "please

tomorrow night."

As I was bidding the Mahatma <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> night, he considerately handed
me a bottle of citronella oil.

"The Wardha mosquitoes don't <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">know</span> a thing about AHIMSA, {FN44-6}

Swamiji!" he said, laughing.

The following morning our little group breakfasted early on a tasty
wheat porridge with molasses and milk. At ten-thirty we were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span>
to the ashram porch for lunch with Gandhi and the SATYAGRAHIS.
Today the menu included brown rice, a <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> selection of vegetables,
and cardamom seeds.

Noon <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> me strolling about the ashram grounds, on to the grazing
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">land</span> of a few imperturbable cows. The protection of cows is a
passion with Gandhi.

"The cow to me <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t14 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">means</span> the entire sub-human world, extending man's
sympathies beyond his own species," the Mahatma has explained. "Man
through the cow is enjoined to realize his identity with all that
lives. Why the ancient rishis selected the cow for apotheosis is
obvious to me. The cow in India was the best comparison; she was
the giver of plenty. Not only did she <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> milk, but she <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span>
agriculture possible. The cow is a poem of pity; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> reads pity in
the gentle animal. She is the <span class="t6 hoverable">second</span> mother to millions of mankind.
Protection of the cow <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t14 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">means</span> protection of the <span class="t3 t5 t7 t9 t20 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> dumb <span class="t14 hoverable">creation</span>
of God. The appeal of the lower <span class="t0 t6 t7 t8 t11 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">order</span> of <span class="t14 hoverable">creation</span> is all the more
forceful because it is speechless."

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Three</span> daily rituals are enjoined on the orthodox Hindu. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">One</span> is BHUTA

YAJNA, an offering of food to the animal kingdom. This ceremony
symbolizes man's realization of his obligations to less evolved

of oblations to ancestors, as a symbol of man's acknowledgment of
his debt to the past, essence of <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whose</span> wisdom illumines humanity
today. NRI YAJNA is an offering of food to strangers or the poor,
symbol of the present responsibilities of man, his duties to
contemporaries.

In the early afternoon I fulfilled a neighborly NRI YAJNA by a
visit to Gandhi's ashram for little girls. Mr. Wright accompanied
me on the ten-minute drive. Tiny young flowerlike faces atop the
long-stemmed colorful SARIS! At the <span class="t7 t10 t15 t25 hoverable">end</span> of a brief talk in Hindi
{FN44-7} which I was giving outdoors, the skies unloosed a sudden
downpour. Laughing, Mr. Wright and I climbed aboard the car and

sped back to MAGANVADI amidst sheets of driving silver. Such tropical
intensity and splash!

Reentering the guest <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> I was struck anew by the stark simplicity
and evidences of self-sacrifice which are everywhere present.
The Gandhi vow of non-possession <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> early in his married life.
Renouncing an extensive legal practice which had been yielding him
an annual income of more than $20,000, the Mahatma dispersed all
his wealth to the poor.

Sri Yukteswar <span class="t27 hoverable">used</span> to poke gentle fun at the commonly inadequate
conceptions of renunciation.

"A beggar <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">cannot</span> renounce wealth," <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">Master</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> say.

'My business has failed; my wife has left me; I will renounce all

He did not renounce wealth and love; they renounced him!"

Saints <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> Gandhi, on the other hand, have <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> not only tangible

The Mahatma's remarkable wife, Kasturabai, did not object when he
failed to <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t15 t17 t18 t19 hoverable">set</span> aside any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of his wealth for the use of herself

and their children. Married in early youth, Gandhi and his wife
<span class="t4 hoverable">took</span> the vow of celibacy after the birth of several sons. {FN44-8}
A tranquil heroine in the intense drama that has been their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span>
together, Kasturabai has followed her husband to prison, shared
his three-week fasts, and fully borne her share of his endless
responsibilities. She has paid Gandhi the following tribute:

I thank you for having had the privilege of being your lifelong
companion and helpmate. I thank you for the most perfect marriage
in the world, based on BRAHMACHARYA (self-control) and not on sex.
I thank you for having considered me your equal in your <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t7 t10 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span>

little.

As a young child, I lived in your parents' home; your mother was a

courageous wife and how to keep the <span class="t7 hoverable">love</span> and respect of her son,
my future husband. As the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span> passed and you became India's most
beloved leader, I had none of the fears that beset the wife who <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span>
be cast aside when her husband has climbed the ladder of success,
as so often happens in other countries.

For <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span> Kasturabai performed the duties of treasurer of the public
funds which the idolized Mahatma is able to raise by the millions.
There are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> humorous stories in Indian homes to the effect that
husbands are nervous about their wives' wearing any jewelry to
a Gandhi meeting; the Mahatma's magical tongue, pleading for the
downtrodden, charms the gold bracelets and diamond necklaces <span class="t27 hoverable">right</span>
off the arms and necks of the wealthy into the collection basket!

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">One</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> the public treasurer, Kasturabai, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> not account for a
disbursement of four rupees. Gandhi duly published an auditing in
which he inexorably pointed out his wife's four rupee discrepancy.

I had often told this story before classes of my American students.

"Mahatma or no Mahatma," she had cried, "if he were my husband
I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> him a black eye for such an unnecessary public
insult!"

After some good-humored banter had passed between us on the subject of
American wives and Hindu wives, I had gone on to a fuller explanation.

"Mrs. Gandhi considers the Mahatma not as her husband but as her
guru, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> who has the <span class="t27 hoverable">right</span> to discipline her for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> insignificant
errors," I had pointed out. "Sometime after Kasturabai had been
publicly rebuked, Gandhi was sentenced to prison on a political
charge. As he was calmly bidding farewell to his wife, she fell at
his feet. 'Master,' she <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> humbly, 'if I have <span class="t29 hoverable">ever</span> offended you,
please forgive me.'" {FN44-9}

At <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> o'clock that afternoon in Wardha, I betook myself,

miracle! Gandhi looked up with his unforgettable smile.

"Mahatmaji," I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> as I squatted beside him on the uncushioned
mat, "please tell me your definition of AHIMSA."

"The avoidance of harm to any living creature in <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> or deed."

"Beautiful ideal! But the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> will always ask: <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">May</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> not kill

"I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> not kill a cobra <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> violating <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> of my vows--fearlessness,

my circumstances." With his amazing candor, Gandhi added, "I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span>

by a cobra!"

I remarked on several very recent Western books on diet which lay
on his desk.

"Yes, diet is important in the SATYAGRAHA movement-as everywhere
else," he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> with a chuckle. "Because I advocate complete continence
for SATYAGRAHIS, I am always trying to find out the best diet for
the celibate. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">One</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> conquer the palate before he can control the
procreative instinct. Semi-starvation or unbalanced diets are not
the answer. After overcoming the inward GREED for food, a SATYAGRAHI
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> continue to follow a rational vegetarian diet with all necessary
vitamins, minerals, calories, and so forth. By inward and outward
wisdom in regard to eating, the SATYAGRAHI'S sexual fluid is easily
turned into vital energy for the <span class="t3 t5 t7 t9 t20 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> body."

The Mahatma and I compared our <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> meat-substitutes.

"The avocado is excellent," I said. "There are numerous avocado
groves near my center in California."

Gandhi's face lit with interest. "I wonder if they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> grow in
Wardha? The SATYAGRAHIS <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> appreciate a <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> food."

"I will be sure to send some avocado plants from Los Angeles to
Wardha." {FN44-10} I added, "Eggs are a high-protein food; are they
forbidden to SATYAGRAHIS?"

"Not unfertilized eggs." The Mahatma laughed reminiscently. "For
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span> I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> not countenance their use; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> now I personally
do not eat them. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">One</span> of my daughters-in-law was once dying of
malnutrition; her doctor insisted on eggs. I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> not agree, and
advised him to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> her some egg-substitute.

"'Gandhiji,' the doctor said, 'unfertilized eggs contain no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span>
sperm; no killing is involved.'

"I then gladly gave permission for my daughter-in-law to eat eggs;
she was soon restored to health."

On the previous night Gandhi had expressed a wish to receive
the KRIYA YOGA of Lahiri Mahasaya. I was touched by the Mahatma's
open-mindedness and <span class="t0 t1 t3 t5 t7 t8 t13 t16 t18 t20 t21 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> of inquiry. He is childlike in his

divine quest, revealing that pure receptivity which <span class="t4 t17 t22 hoverable">Jesus</span> praised
in children, ". . . of such is the kingdom of heaven."

The hour for my promised instruction had arrived; several SATYAGRAHIS
now entered the room-Mr. Desai, Dr. Pingale, and a few <span class="t1 t7 t13 hoverable">others</span> who
desired the KRIYA technique.

I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> taught the little class the physical YOGODA exercises. The
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> is visualized as divided into twenty parts; the will directs
energy in turn to each section. Soon everyone was vibrating before
me <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> a <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> motor. It was easy to observe the rippling effect
on Gandhi's twenty <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> parts, at all times completely exposed to
view! <span class="t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Though</span> very thin, he is not unpleasingly so; the skin of
his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> is smooth and unwrinkled.

Later I initiated the group into the liberating technique of KRIYA
YOGA.

The Mahatma has reverently studied all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> religions. The
Jain scriptures, the Biblical <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">New</span> Testament, and the sociological
writings of Tolstoy {FN44-11} are the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> main sources of Gandhi's
nonviolent convictions. He has stated his credo thus:

I believe the Bible, the KORAN, and the ZEND-AVESTA {FN44-12} to
be as divinely inspired as the VEDAS. I believe in the institution

of Gurus, but in this age millions <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> go <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> a Guru, because
it is a rare thing to find a combination of perfect purity and
perfect learning. But <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> need not despair of <span class="t29 hoverable">ever</span> knowing the
<span class="t3 t7 t9 t10 t15 t19 t22 hoverable">truth</span> of one's religion, because the fundamentals of Hinduism as
of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> religion are unchangeable, and easily understood.

I believe <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> Hindu in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> and His oneness, in rebirth and
salvation. . . . I can no more describe my feeling for Hinduism
than for my own wife. She moves me as no other woman in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span>
can. Not that she has no faults; I daresay she has <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> more than

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Even</span> so I feel for and about Hinduism with all its faults and
limitations. <span class="t15 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">Nothing</span> delights me so <span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">much</span> as the music of the GITA,
or the RAMAYANA by Tulsidas. When I fancied I was taking my last
breath, the GITA was my solace.

Hinduism is not an exclusive religion. In it there is room for
the worship of all the prophets of the world. {FN44-13} It is not
a missionary religion in the ordinary sense of the term. It has
no doubt absorbed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> tribes in its fold, but this absorption has
been of an evolutionary, imperceptible character. Hinduism tells
each <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> to worship <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">according</span> to his own faith or DHARMA,
{FN44-14} and so lives at peace with all religions.

Of Christ, Gandhi has written: "I am sure that if He were living

toward which we all ought to aspire. I believe that He belongs not
solely to Christianity, but to the entire world, to all lands and
races."

On my last evening in Wardha I addressed the meeting which had
been <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> by Mr. Desai in Town Hall. The room was thronged to
the window sills with about 400 <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> assembled to hear the talk
on yoga. I spoke <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> in Hindi, then in English. Our little group
returned to the ashram in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> for a good-night glimpse of Gandhi,
enfolded in peace and correspondence.

Night was still lingering when I rose at 5:00 A.M. Village <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> was

After breakfast our trio sought out Gandhi for farewell PRONAMS.
The saint rises at four o'clock for his morning prayer.

"Mahatmaji, good-by!" I knelt to touch his feet. "India is safe in
your keeping!"

Years have rolled by since the Wardha idyl; the earth, oceans, and

Gandhi has offered a practical nonviolent alternative to armed
might. To redress grievances and remove injustices, the Mahatma
has employed nonviolent <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t14 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">means</span> which again and again have proved
their effectiveness. He states his doctrine in these words:

I have <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> persists in the midst of destruction.
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Therefore</span> there <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> be a higher <span class="t0 t8 t12 t15 t19 t23 t25 hoverable">law</span> than that of destruction. Only

Wherever there are wars, wherever we are confronted with an opponent,
conquer by love. I have <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> that the <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> <span class="t0 t8 t12 t15 t19 t23 t25 hoverable">law</span> of <span class="t7 hoverable">love</span> has
answered in my own <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> as the <span class="t0 t8 t12 t15 t19 t23 t25 hoverable">law</span> of destruction has <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> done.

In India we have had an ocular demonstration of the operation of
this <span class="t0 t8 t12 t15 t19 t23 t25 hoverable">law</span> on the widest scale possible. I don't claim that nonviolence
has penetrated the 360,000,000 <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> in India, but I do claim
it has penetrated deeper than any other doctrine in an incredibly
short time.

It takes a fairly strenuous course of training to attain a mental
state of nonviolence. It is a disciplined life, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of

a soldier. The perfect state is reached only when the mind, body,
and speech are in proper coordination. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Every</span> problem <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> lend

Just as a scientist will <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t7 t10 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> wonders out of various applications

infinitely more wonderful and subtle than forces of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> like,

The nonviolent voice of Gandhi appeals to man's <span class="t6 t9 t22 t29 hoverable">highest</span> conscience.
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Let</span> nations ally themselves no longer with death, but with life; not

"One should forgive, under any injury," <span class="t1 t7 t9 t14 t15 t17 t25 t28 hoverable">says</span> the MAHABHARATA. "It

are the qualities of the self-possessed. They represent eternal

Nonviolence is the natural outgrowth of the <span class="t0 t8 t12 t15 t19 t23 t25 hoverable">law</span> of forgiveness and

field of Indian social reform. Gandhi and his followers have removed

of thousands of Moslems look to the Mahatma as their leader.
The untouchables have <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> in him their fearless and triumphant

champion. "If there be a rebirth in store for me," Gandhi wrote,
"I wish to be born a pariah in the midst of pariahs, because thereby
I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be able to render them more effective service."

The Mahatma is indeed a "great soul," but it was illiterate millions
who had the discernment to bestow the title. This gentle prophet
is honored in his own land. The lowly peasant has been able to rise
to Gandhi's high challenge. The Mahatma wholeheartedly believes in
the inherent nobility of man. The inevitable failures have <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span>
disillusioned him. "Even if the opponent plays him false twenty times,"
he writes, "the SATYAGRAHI is ready to trust him the twenty-first
time, for an implicit trust in <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> is the very essence of
the creed." {FN44-18}

"Mahatmaji, you are an exceptional man. You <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> not expect the

"It is curious how we delude ourselves, fancying that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> can
be improved, but that it is impossible to evoke the hidden powers
of the soul," Gandhi replied. "I am engaged in trying to show that

MAHATMA GANDHI'S HANDWRITING IN HINDI

[Illustration--see gandhi2.jpg]

Mahatma Gandhi visited my high school with yoga training at Ranchi.
He graciously wrote the above lines in the Ranchi guest-book. The
translation is: "This institution has deeply impressed my mind.
I cherish high hopes that this school will encourage the further
practical use of the spinning wheel."

(SIGNED) MOHANDAS GANDHI September 17, 1925

[Illustration--see gandhiflag.jpg]

A national flag for India was designed in 1921 by Gandhi. The
stripes are saffron, white and green; the CHARKA (spinning wheel)
in the center is dark blue. "The CHARKA symbolizes energy,"
he wrote, "and reminds us that during the past eras of prosperity
in India's history, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t29 hoverable">hand</span> spinning and other domestic crafts were
prominent."

refers to himself as "Mahatma."

{FN44-2} The literal translation from Sanskrit is "holding to
truth." SATYAGRAHA is the famous nonviolence movement led by Gandhi.

{FN44-3} False and alas! malicious reports were recently circulated
that Miss Slade has severed all her ties with Gandhi and forsaken
her vows. Miss Slade, the Mahatma's SATYAGRAHA disciple for twenty
years, issued a signed statement to the UNITED PRESS, dated Dec.
29, 1945, in which she explained that a <span class="t14 hoverable">series</span> of baseless rumors
arose after she had departed, with Gandhi's blessings, for a small
site in northeastern India near the Himalayas, for the purpose of
founding there her now-flourishing KISAN ASHRAM (center for medical
and agricultural aid to peasant farmers). Mahatma Gandhi plans to
visit the <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> ashram during 1946.

{FN44-4} Miss Slade reminded me of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">another</span> distinguished Western

five <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span> of her life, happily pursuing a path of discipline at
the feet of Sri Aurobindo Ghosh. This sage <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> speaks; he silently

silence, to the consternation of callers and secretaries.

{FN44-6} Harmlessness; nonviolence; the foundation rock of Gandhi's
creed. He was born into a family of strict Jains, who revere AHIMSA

as the root-virtue. Jainism, a sect of Hinduism, was founded in the
6th century B.C. by Mahavira, a contemporary of Buddha. Mahavira
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t14 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">means</span> "great hero"; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> he look down the centuries on his heroic

{FN44-7} Hindi is the lingua franca for the <span class="t3 t5 t7 t9 t20 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> of India. An
Indo-Aryan language based largely on Sanskrit roots, Hindi is the
chief vernacular of northern India. The main dialect of Western
Hindi is Hindustani, <span class="t23 hoverable">written</span> both in the DEVANAGARI (Sanskrit)
characters and in Arabic characters. Its subdialect, Urdu, is spoken
by Moslems.

22, 1944. The usually unemotional Gandhi wept silently. Shortly
after her admirers had suggested a Memorial Fund in her honor, 125

over India. Gandhi has arranged that the fund be <span class="t27 hoverable">used</span> for village

CHAPTER: 45

THE BENGALI "JOY-PERMEATED" MOTHER

"Sir, please do not leave India <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> a glimpse of Nirmala Devi.
Her sanctity is intense; she is <span class="t6 t10 t15 hoverable">known</span> <span class="t6 t9 t18 t26 hoverable">far</span> and wide as Ananda Moyi Ma
(Joy-Permeated Mother)." My niece, Amiyo Bose, gazed at me earnestly.

"Of course! I want very <span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">much</span> to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> the woman saint." I added, "I

have read of her advanced state of God-realization. A little article
about her appeared <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span> ago in EAST-WEST."

"I have met her," Amiyo <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> on. "She recently visited my own little
town of Jamshedpur. At the entreaty of a disciple, Ananda Moyi Ma
<span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> to the home of a dying man. She stood by his bedside; as her
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t29 hoverable">hand</span> touched his forehead, his death-rattle ceased. The disease
vanished at once; to the man's glad astonishment, he was well."

A few <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t11 t20 t26 t27 hoverable">days</span> later I heard that the Blissful Mother was staying at
the home of a disciple in the Bhowanipur section of Calcutta. Mr.
Wright and I <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t15 t17 t18 t19 hoverable">set</span> out immediately from my father's Calcutta home. As
the Ford neared the Bhowanipur house, my companion and I observed
an unusual street scene.

Ananda Moyi Ma was standing in an open-topped automobile, blessing
a throng of about <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> hundred disciples. She was evidently on the
point of departure. Mr. Wright parked the Ford some distance away,
and accompanied me on foot toward the quiet assemblage. The woman
saint glanced in our direction; she alit from her car and walked
toward us.

"Father, you have come!" With these fervent <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">words</span> she <span class="t0 t2 t16 t18 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">put</span> her arm
around my neck and her head on my shoulder. Mr. Wright, to whom I
had just remarked that I did not <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">know</span> the saint, was hugely enjoying

this extraordinary demonstration of welcome. The eyes of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span>
hundred chelas were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> fixed with some surprise on the affectionate
tableau.

I had instantly seen that the saint was in a high state of SAMADHI.
Utterly oblivious to her outward garb as a woman, she knew herself
as the changeless soul; from that plane she was joyously greeting
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">another</span> devotee of God. She led me by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t29 hoverable">hand</span> into her automobile.

"Ananda Moyi Ma, I am delaying your journey!" I protested.

"Father, I am meeting you for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> in this life, after
ages!" she said. "Please do not leave yet."

We sat <span class="t16 t21 hoverable">together</span> in the rear seats of the car. The Blissful Mother
soon entered the immobile ecstatic state. Her beautiful eyes
glanced heavenward and, half-opened, became stilled, gazing into
the near-far inner Elysium. The disciples chanted gently: "Victory
to Mother Divine!"

I had <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> of God-realization in India, but <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> before
had I met such an exalted woman saint. Her gentle face was burnished
with the ineffable joy that had <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> her the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> of Blissful
Mother. <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Long</span> black tresses lay loosely behind her unveiled head. A
red dot of sandalwood paste on her forehead symbolized the <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span>

eye, <span class="t29 hoverable">ever</span> open <span class="t5 t7 hoverable">within</span> her. Tiny face, tiny hands, tiny feet-a
contrast to her <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> magnitude!

I <span class="t0 t2 t16 t18 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">put</span> some questions to a near-by woman chela while Ananda Moyi Ma
remained entranced.

"The Blissful Mother travels widely in India; in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> parts she has

scarcely breathing, her eyes unwinking. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">One</span> of her chief disciples

the vow of silence."

The chela pointed to a broad-shouldered, fine-featured <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> with
<span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> hair and hoary beard. He was standing quietly in the midst of
the gathering, his hands folded in a disciple's reverential attitude.

Refreshed by her dip in the Infinite, Ananda Moyi Ma was now focusing

her consciousness on the material world.

"Father, please tell me where you stay." Her voice was clear and
melodious.

"At present, in Calcutta or Ranchi; but soon I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> be returning
to America."

"America?"

"Yes. An Indian woman saint <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be sincerely appreciated there
by <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> seekers. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Would</span> you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> to go?"

"If <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t28 hoverable">Father</span> can <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">take</span> me, I will go."

This reply caused her near-by disciples to start in alarm.

"Twenty or more of us always travel with the Blissful Mother," <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span>
of them told me firmly. "We <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> not live <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> her.

Reluctantly I abandoned the plan, as possessing an impractical
feature of spontaneous enlargement!

"Please <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> at least to Ranchi, with your disciples," I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> on

taking leave of the saint. "As a <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> child yourself, you will
enjoy the little ones in my school."

"Whenever <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t28 hoverable">Father</span> takes me, I will gladly go."

A short <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> later the Ranchi VIDYALAYA was in gala array for the
saint's promised visit. The youngsters looked forward to any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span>
of festivity-no lessons, hours of music, and a feast for the climax!

"Victory! Ananda Moyi Ma, ki jai!" This reiterated chant from
scores of enthusiastic little throats greeted the saint's party
as it entered the school gates. Showers of marigolds, tinkle of
cymbals, lusty blowing of conch shells and beat of the MRIDANGA
drum! The Blissful Mother wandered smilingly over the sunny VIDYALAYA
grounds, <span class="t29 hoverable">ever</span> carrying <span class="t5 t7 hoverable">within</span> her the portable paradise.

"It is beautiful here," Ananda Moyi Ma <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> graciously as I led her
into the main building. She seated herself with a childlike smile
by my side. The closest of dear friends, she <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> feel, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> an
aura of remoteness was <span class="t29 hoverable">ever</span> around her-the paradoxical isolation
of Omnipresence.

"Please tell me something of your life."

"Father knows all about it; why repeat it?" She evidently felt that

the factual history of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> short incarnation was beneath notice.

I laughed, gently repeating my question.

"Father, there is little to tell." She spread her graceful hands
in a deprecatory gesture. "My consciousness has <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> associated
itself with this temporary body. Before I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> on this earth, Father,
'I was the same.' As a little girl, 'I was the same.' I grew into
womanhood, but still 'I was the same.' When the family in which
I had been born <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> arrangements to have this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> married, 'I
was the same.' And when, passion-drunk, my husband <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> to me and
murmured endearing words, lightly touching my body, he received a
violent shock, as if struck by lightning, for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> then 'I was the
same.'

"My husband knelt before me, folded his hands, and implored my
pardon.

"'Mother,' he said, 'because I have desecrated your bodily temple
by touching it with the <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> of lust-not knowing that <span class="t5 t7 hoverable">within</span> it

in silence as a servant, <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> speaking to anyone again as <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> as
I live. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">May</span> I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> atone for the <span class="t26 hoverable">sin</span> I have today committed against
you, my guru.'

"Even when I quietly accepted this proposal of my husband's, 'I
was the same.' And, Father, in front of you now, 'I am the same.'
<span class="t29 hoverable">Ever</span> afterward, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> the dance of <span class="t14 hoverable">creation</span> change around me in
the hall of eternity, 'I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> be the same.'"

Ananda Moyi Ma sank into a deep meditative state. Her <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> was
statue-still; she had fled to her ever-calling kingdom. The dark
pools of her eyes appeared lifeless and glassy. This expression
is often present when saints remove their consciousness from the
physical body, which is then hardly more than a piece of soulless
clay. We sat <span class="t16 t21 hoverable">together</span> for an hour in the ecstatic trance. She
returned to this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> with a gay little laugh.

"Please, Ananda Moyi Ma," I said, "come with me to the garden. Mr.
Wright will <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">take</span> some pictures."

"Of course, Father. Your will is my will." Her glorious eyes retained
the unchanging <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> luster as she posed for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> photographs.

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Time</span> for the feast! Ananda Moyi Ma squatted on her blanket-seat,
a disciple at her elbow to feed her. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Like</span> an infant, the saint
obediently swallowed the food after the chela had <span class="t2 t4 t5 t22 t23 hoverable">brought</span> it to
her lips. It was plain that the Blissful Mother did not recognize
any difference between curries and sweetmeats!

As dusk approached, the saint left with her party amidst a shower
of rose petals, her hands raised in blessing on the little lads.
Their faces shone with the affection she had effortlessly awakened.

"Thou <span class="t2 t4 t5 t9 t11 t16 t22 t24 t26 hoverable">shalt</span> <span class="t7 hoverable">love</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thy</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> with all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thy</span> heart, and with all

sole allegiance to the Lord. Not by the hairsplitting distinctions
of scholars but by the sure logic of faith, the childlike saint has
solved the only problem in <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> life-establishment of unity with

million issues. Refusing a monotheistic <span class="t7 hoverable">love</span> to God, the nations
disguise their infidelity by punctilious respect before the outward

for a moment they divert man's attention from himself, but they do
not free him from his single responsibility in life, referred to

on the Serampore station platform, waiting for the train.

"Father, I am going to the Himalayas," she told me. "Generous
disciples have built me a hermitage in Dehra Dun."

As she boarded the train, I marveled to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> that whether amidst a

looked <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">away</span> from God. <span class="t5 t7 hoverable">Within</span> me I still hear her voice, an echo of

CHAPTER: 46

THE WOMAN YOGI WHO <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">NEVER</span> EATS

"Sir, whither are we bound this morning?" Mr. Wright was driving
the Ford; he <span class="t4 hoverable">took</span> his eyes off the road <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> enough to gaze at me
with a questioning twinkle. From <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> he seldom knew what

"God willing," I replied devoutly, "we are on our <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> an

"Repetition of wonders-after Therese Neumann." But Mr. Wright laughed
eagerly just the same; he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> accelerated the speed of the car.

tourist, that!

The Ranchi school had just been left behind us; we had risen before
the sun. Besides my secretary and myself, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> Bengali friends
were in the party. We drank in the exhilarating air, the natural
wine of the morning. Our driver guided the car warily <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span> the
early peasants and the two-wheeled carts, slowly drawn by yoked,
hump-shouldered bullocks, inclined to dispute the road with a
honking interloper.

"Sir, we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> to <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">know</span> more of the fasting saint."

"Her <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> is Giri Bala," I informed my companions. "I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> heard
about her <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span> ago from a scholarly gentleman, Sthiti Lal Nundy.
He often <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> to the Gurpar Road home to tutor my brother Bishnu."

"'I <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">know</span> Giri Bala well,' Sthiti Babu told me. 'She employs a
<span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> yoga technique which enables her to live <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> eating. I
was her close neighbor in Nawabganj near Ichapur. {FN46-1} I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span>
it a point to watch her closely; <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> did I find evidence that
she was taking either food or drink. My interest finally mounted so
high that I approached the Maharaja of Burdwan {FN46-2} and asked
him to conduct an investigation. Astounded at the story, he invited
her to his palace. She agreed to a test and lived for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> months
locked up in a small section of his home. Later she returned for a
palace visit of twenty days; and then for a third test of fifteen
days. The Maharaja himself told me that these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> rigorous
scrutinies had convinced him beyond doubt of her non-eating state.'

"This story of Sthiti Babu's has remained in my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> for over
twenty-five years," I concluded. "Sometimes in America I wondered
if the river of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> not swallow the YOGINI {FN46-3} before

where, or if, she lives. But in a few hours we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> reach Purulia;
her brother has a home there."

By ten-thirty our little group was conversing with the brother,

Lambadar Dey, a lawyer of Purulia.

"Yes, my sister is living. She sometimes stays with me here, but at
present she is at our family home in Biur." Lambadar Babu glanced
doubtfully at the Ford. "I hardly think, Swamiji, that any automobile
has <span class="t29 hoverable">ever</span> penetrated into the interior as <span class="t6 t9 t18 t26 hoverable">far</span> as Biur. It <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t18 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">might</span> be
best if you all resign yourselves to the ancient jolt of the bullock
cart!"

As <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> voice our party pledged loyalty to the Pride of Detroit.

"The Ford comes from America," I told the lawyer. "It <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be a
shame to deprive it of an opportunity to get acquainted with the
<span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t16 t19 t22 t23 t25 t26 hoverable">heart</span> of Bengal!"

"May Ganesh {FN46-4} go with you!" Lambadar Babu said, laughing.
He added courteously, "If you <span class="t29 hoverable">ever</span> get there, I am sure Giri Bala
will be glad to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> you. She is approaching her seventies, but
continues in excellent health."

"Please tell me, sir, if it is absolutely <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> that she eats
nothing?" I looked directly into his eyes, those telltale windows
of the mind.

[Illustration: GIRI BALA, This <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> woman yogi has not <span class="t19 hoverable">taken</span> food

or drink since 1880. I am pictured with her, in 1936, at her home
in the isolated Bengal village of Biur. Her non-eating state has
been rigorously investigated by the Maharaja of Burdwan. She employs
a <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> yoga technique to recharge her <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> with cosmic energy

"It is true." His gaze was open and honorable. "In more than five
decades I have <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> seen her eat a morsel. If the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> suddenly

of my sister's taking food!"

We chuckled <span class="t16 t21 hoverable">together</span> over the improbability of these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> cosmic
events.

"Giri Bala has <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> sought an inaccessible solitude for her yoga
practices," Lambadar Babu <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> on. "She has lived her entire <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span>
surrounded by her family and friends. They are all <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t8 t10 t12 t13 t14 t17 t19 t23 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> accustomed
now to her strange state. Not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of them who <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> not be stupefied
if Giri Bala suddenly decided to eat anything! Sister is naturally
retiring, as befits a Hindu widow, but our little circle in Purulia
and in Biur all <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">know</span> that she is literally an 'exceptional' woman."

The brother's sincerity was manifest. Our little party thanked him
warmly and <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t15 t17 t18 t19 hoverable">set</span> out toward Biur. We stopped at a street shop for
curry and LUCHIS, attracting a swarm of urchins who gathered round

to watch Mr. Wright eating with his fingers in the simple Hindu
manner. {FN46-5} Hearty appetites caused us to fortify ourselves
against an afternoon which, unknown at the moment, was to prove
fairly laborious.

Our <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> now led east through sun-baked rice fields into the Burdwan
section of Bengal. On through roads lined with dense vegetation;
the songs of the MAYNAS and the stripe-throated BULBULS streamed
out from trees with huge, umbrellalike branches. A bullock cart
now and then, the RINI, RINI, MANJU, MANJU squeak of its axle and
iron-shod wooden wheels contrasting sharply in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> with the SWISH,
SWISH of auto tires over the aristocratic asphalt of the cities.

"Dick, halt!" My sudden request <span class="t2 t4 t5 t22 t23 hoverable">brought</span> a jolting protest from the
Ford. "That overburdened mango tree is fairly shouting an invitation!"

The five of us dashed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">children</span> to the mango-strewn earth; the
tree had benevolently shed its fruits as they had ripened.

"Full <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> a mango is born to lie unseen," I paraphrased, "and
waste its sweetness on the stony ground."

"Nothing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> this in America, Swamiji, eh?" laughed Sailesh
Mazumdar, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of my Bengali students.

"No," I admitted, covered with mango juice and contentment. "How
I have missed this fruit in the West! A Hindu's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t15 t18 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heaven</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span>
mangoes is inconceivable!"

I picked up a rock and downed a proud beauty hidden on the <span class="t6 t9 t22 t29 hoverable">highest</span>
limb.

"Dick," I asked between bites of ambrosia, warm with the tropical
sun, "are all the cameras in the car?"

"Yes, sir; in the baggage compartment."

"If Giri Bala proves to be a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> saint, I want to write about her
in the West. A Hindu YOGINI with such inspiring powers should not
live and die unknown-like most of these mangoes."

Half an hour later I was still strolling in the sylvan peace.

"Sir," Mr. Wright remarked, "we should reach Giri Bala before the
<span class="t0 t8 t11 t14 t23 t25 t28 hoverable">sun</span> sets, to have enough <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> for photographs." He added with a
grin, "The Westerners are a skeptical lot; we can't expect them to
believe in the lady <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> any pictures!"

This bit of wisdom was indisputable; I turned my back on temptation
and reentered the car.

"You are right, Dick," I sighed as we sped along, "I <span class="t27 hoverable">sacrifice</span> the
mango paradise on the altar of Western realism. Photographs we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span>
have!"

The road became more and more sickly: wrinkles of ruts, boils of
hardened clay, the sad infirmities of <span class="t25 hoverable">old</span> age! Our group dismounted
occasionally to allow Mr. Wright to more easily maneuver the Ford,
which the four of us pushed from behind.

"Lambadar Babu spoke truly," Sailesh acknowledged. "The car is not
carrying us; we are carrying the car!"

Our climb-in, climb-out auto tedium was beguiled <span class="t29 hoverable">ever</span> and anon by
the appearance of a village, each <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> a scene of quaint simplicity.

fascinating are these clusters of thatched mud huts, decorated with

innocently playing about, pausing to stare or run wildly from
this big, black, bullockless carriage tearing madly through their
village. The women merely peep from the shadows, while the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span>
lazily loll beneath the trees along the roadside, curious beneath

their nonchalance. In <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> place, all the villagers were gaily
bathing in the large tank (in their garments, changing by draping
dry cloths around their bodies, dropping the wet ones). Women
bearing <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> to their homes, in huge brass jars.

"The road led us a merry chase over mount and ridge; we bounced and
tossed, dipped into small streams, detoured around an unfinished
causeway, slithered across dry, sandy river beds and finally, about
5:00 P.M., we were close to our destination, Biur. This minute
village in the interior of Bankura District, hidden in the protection
of dense foliage, is unapproachable by travelers during the rainy
season, when the streams are raging torrents and the roads serpentlike
spit the mud-venom.

"Asking for a guide <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span> a group of worshipers on their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> home
from a temple prayer (out in the lonely field), we were besieged by
a dozen scantily clad lads who clambered on the sides of the car,
eager to conduct us to Giri Bala.

"The road led toward a grove of date palms sheltering a group of
mud huts, but before we had reached it, the Ford was momentarily
tipped at a dangerous angle, tossed up and dropped down. The narrow
trail led around trees and tank, over ridges, into holes and deep
ruts. The car became anchored on a clump of bushes, then grounded
on a hillock, requiring a lift of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> clods; on we proceeded,

slowly and carefully; suddenly the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> was stopped by a mass of
brush in the middle of the cart track, necessitating a detour down
a precipitous ledge into a dry tank, rescue from which demanded some
scraping, adzing, and shoveling. Again and again the road seemed
impassable, but the pilgrimage <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> go on; obliging lads fetched
spades and demolished the obstacles (shades of Ganesh!) while
hundreds of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">children</span> and parents stared.

"Soon we were threading our <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> along the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> ruts of antiquity,
women gazing wide-eyed from their hut doors, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> trailing alongside
and behind us, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">children</span> scampering to swell the procession. Ours
was perhaps the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> auto to traverse these roads; the 'bullock

group piloted by an American and pioneering in a snorting car
<span class="t27 hoverable">right</span> into their hamlet fastness, invading the ancient privacy and
sanctity!

"Halting by a narrow lane we <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> ourselves <span class="t5 t7 hoverable">within</span> a hundred feet
of Giri Bala's ancestral home. We felt the thrill of fulfillment
after the <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> road struggle crowned by a rough finish. We approached
a large, two-storied building of brick and plaster, dominating the
surrounding adobe huts; the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> was under the process of repair,
for around it was the characteristically tropical framework of
bamboos.

"With feverish anticipation and suppressed rejoicing we stood
before the open doors of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> blessed by the Lord's 'hungerless'
touch. Constantly agape were the villagers, young and old, bare
and dressed, women aloof somewhat but inquisitive too, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> and
boys unabashedly at our heels as they gazed on this unprecedented
spectacle.

"Soon a short figure <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> into view in the doorway-Giri Bala! She
was swathed in a cloth of dull, goldish silk; in typically Indian
fashion, she drew forward modestly and hesitatingly, peering
slightly from beneath the upper fold of her SWADESHI cloth. Her
eyes glistened <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> smouldering embers in the shadow of her head
piece; we were enamored by a most benevolent and kindly face, a face
of realization and understanding, free from the taint of earthly
attachment.

"Meekly she approached and silently assented to our snapping a
number of pictures with our 'still' and 'movie' cameras. {FN46-6}
Patiently and shyly she endured our photo techniques of posture
adjustment and <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> arrangement. Finally we had recorded for
posterity <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> photographs of the only woman in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> who is
<span class="t6 t10 t15 hoverable">known</span> to have lived <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> food or drink for over fifty years.
(Therese Neumann, of course, has fasted since 1923.) Most motherly
was Giri Bala's expression as she stood before us, completely
covered in the loose-flowing cloth, <span class="t15 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">nothing</span> of her <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> visible

but her face with its downcast eyes, her hands, and her tiny feet.
A face of rare peace and innocent poise-a wide, childlike, quivering
lip, a feminine nose, narrow, sparkling eyes, and a wistful smile."

Mr. Wright's impression of Giri Bala was shared by myself; spirituality
enfolded her <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> her gently shining veil. She PRONAMED before me
in the customary gesture of greeting from a householder to a monk.
Her simple charm and quiet smile gave us a welcome beyond that of
honeyed oratory; forgotten was our difficult, dusty trip.

The little saint seated herself cross-legged on the verandah. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Though</span>
bearing the scars of age, she was not emaciated; her olive-colored
skin had remained clear and healthy in tone.

"Mother," I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> in Bengali, "for over twenty-five <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span> I have
<span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> eagerly of this very pilgrimage! I heard about your sacred

She nodded in acknowledgment. "Yes, my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> neighbor in Nawabganj."

"During those <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span> I have crossed the oceans, but I <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> forgot
my early plan to someday <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> you. The sublime drama that you are
here playing so inconspicuously should be blazoned before a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span>
that has <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> forgotten the inner food divine."

The saint lifted her eyes for a minute, smiling with serene interest.

"Baba (honored father) knows best," she answered meekly.

I was happy that she had <span class="t19 hoverable">taken</span> no offense; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> knows how

shun it, as a rule, wishing to pursue in silence the profound <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span>
research. An inner sanction comes to them when the proper <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span>
arrives to display their lives openly for the benefit of seeking
minds.

"Mother," I <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> on, "please forgive me, then, for burdening you
with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> questions. Kindly answer only those that please you; I

She spread her hands in a gracious gesture. "I am glad to reply,
insofar as an insignificant <span class="t9 hoverable">person</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> myself can <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> satisfactory
answers."

"Oh, no, not insignificant!" I protested sincerely. "You are a

"I am the humble servant of all." She added quaintly, "I <span class="t7 hoverable">love</span> to
cook and feed people."

A strange pastime, I thought, for a non-eating saint!

"Tell me, Mother, from your own lips-do you live <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> food?"

"That is true." She was silent for a few moments; her next remark
showed that she had been struggling with mental arithmetic. "From
the age of twelve <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span> four months down to my present age of
sixty-eight--a period of over fifty-six years--I have not eaten
food or <span class="t19 hoverable">taken</span> liquids."

"Are you <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> tempted to eat?"

"If I felt a craving for food, I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have to eat." Simply <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span>
regally she stated this axiomatic truth, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> <span class="t6 t10 t15 hoverable">known</span> too <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t8 t10 t12 t13 t14 t17 t19 t23 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> by a

"But you do eat something!" My tone held a <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t9 t12 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">note</span> of remonstrance.

"Of course!" She smiled in swift understanding.

"Your nourishment derives from the finer energies of the air and
sunlight, {FN46-7} and from the cosmic <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> which recharges your

"Baba knows." Again she acquiesced, her manner soothing and

unemphatic.

"Mother, please tell me about your early life. It holds a deep
interest for all of India, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> for our brothers and sisters
beyond the seas."

Giri Bala <span class="t0 t2 t16 t18 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">put</span> aside her habitual reserve, relaxing into a conversational
mood.

"So be it." Her voice was low and firm. "I was born in these forest
regions. My childhood was unremarkable save that I was possessed
by an insatiable appetite. I had been betrothed in early years.

"'Child,' my mother often warned me, 'try to control your greed.
When the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> comes for you to live <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span> strangers in your husband's

"The calamity she had foreseen <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> to pass. I was only twelve

shamed me morning, noon, and night about my gluttonous habits.
Her scoldings were a blessing in disguise, however; they roused my
dormant <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> tendencies. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">One</span> morning her ridicule was merciless.

"'I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> soon prove to you,' I said, stung to the quick, 'that I

"My mother-in-law laughed in derision. 'So!' she said, 'how can
you live <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> eating, when you <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">cannot</span> live <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> overeating?'

"This remark was unanswerable! <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> an iron resolution scaffolded
my spirit. In a secluded spot I sought my Heavenly Father.

"'Lord,' I prayed incessantly, 'please send me a guru, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> who can

"A <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> ecstasy fell over me. Led by a beatific spell, I <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t15 t17 t18 t19 hoverable">set</span> out
for the Nawabganj GHAT on the Ganges. On the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> I encountered the
priest of my husband's family.

"'Venerable sir,' I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> trustingly, 'kindly tell me how to live

"He stared at me <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> reply. Finally he spoke in a consoling
manner. 'Child,' he said, 'come to the temple this evening; I will
conduct a special VEDIC ceremony for you.'

"This vague answer was not the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> I was seeking; I continued toward
the GHAT. The morning <span class="t0 t8 t11 t14 t23 t25 t28 hoverable">sun</span> pierced the waters; I purified myself in
the Ganges, as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> for a sacred initiation. As I left the river

bank, my wet cloth around me, in the broad glare of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> my <span class="t6 t18 hoverable">master</span>
materialized himself before me!

"'Dear little one,' he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> in a voice of loving compassion, 'I

live by the astral light, your bodily atoms fed from the infinite
current.'"

Giri Bala fell into silence. I <span class="t4 hoverable">took</span> Mr. Wright's pencil and pad
and translated into English a few items for his information.

The saint resumed the tale, her gentle voice barely audible. "The
GHAT was deserted, but my guru cast round us an aura of guarding
light, that no stray bathers later disturb us. He initiated me
into a KRIA technique which frees the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> from dependence on the
gross food of mortals. The technique includes the use of a <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span>
MANTRA {FN46-8} and a breathing exercise more difficult than the
average <span class="t9 hoverable">person</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> perform. No medicine or magic is involved;
<span class="t15 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">nothing</span> beyond the KRIA."

In the manner of the American newspaper reporter, who had unknowingly
taught me his procedure, I questioned Giri Bala on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> matters

bit by bit, the following information:

"I have <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> had any children; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span> ago I became a widow.
I sleep very little, as sleep and waking are the same to me. I
meditate at night, attending to my domestic duties in the daytime. I
slightly feel the change in climate from season to season. I have
<span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> been sick or experienced any disease. I feel only slight
pain when accidentally injured. I have no bodily excretions. I
can control my <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t16 t19 t22 t23 t25 t26 hoverable">heart</span> and breathing. I often <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> my guru as <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t8 t10 t12 t13 t14 t17 t19 t23 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> as

"Mother," I asked, "why don't you teach <span class="t1 t7 t13 hoverable">others</span> the method of living
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> food?"

My ambitious hopes for the world's starving millions were nipped
in the bud.

"No." She shook her head. "I was strictly commanded by my guru
not to divulge the secret. It is not his wish to tamper with God's
drama of creation. The farmers <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> not thank me if I taught

uselessly on the ground. It appears that misery, starvation, and
disease are whips of our karma which ultimately drive us to seek
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t6 t13 t14 t25 t27 hoverable">meaning</span> of life."

"Mother," I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> slowly, "what is the use of your having been

"To prove that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> is Spirit." Her face lit with wisdom. "To
demonstrate that by <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> advancement he can gradually learn to

The saint sank into a deep meditative state. Her gaze was directed
inward; the gentle depths of her eyes became expressionless. She
gave a <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> sigh, the prelude to the ecstatic breathless trance.
For a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> she had fled to the questionless realm, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t15 t18 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heaven</span> of
inner joy.

The tropical darkness had fallen. The <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> of a small kerosene
lamp flickered fitfully over the faces of a score of villagers
squatting silently in the shadows. The darting glowworms and distant
oil lanterns of the huts wove bright eerie patterns into the velvet
night. It was the painful hour of parting; a slow, tedious journey
lay before our little party.

"Giri Bala," I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> as the saint opened her eyes, "please <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> me

She soon returned with a piece of Benares silk, extending it in
her <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t29 hoverable">hand</span> as she suddenly prostrated herself on the ground.

CHAPTER: 47

I RETURN TO THE WEST

"I have <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> yoga lessons in India and America; but I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span>
confess that, as a Hindu, I am unusually happy to be conducting a
class for English students."

My London class members laughed appreciatively; no political turmoils
<span class="t29 hoverable">ever</span> disturbed our yoga peace.

India was now a hallowed memory. It is September, 1936; I am
in England to fulfill a promise, <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> sixteen months earlier, to
lecture again in London.

England, too, is receptive to the timeless yoga message. Reporters
and newsreel cameramen swarmed over my quarters at Grosvenor House.
The British National Council of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">World</span> Fellowship of Faiths
organized a meeting on September 29th at Whitefield's Congregational
Church where I addressed the audience on the weighty subject of

"How Faith in Fellowship <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> Save Civilization." The eight o'clock
lectures at Caxton Hall attracted such crowds that on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> nights
the overflow waited in Windsor <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">House</span> auditorium for my <span class="t6 hoverable">second</span> talk
at nine-thirty. Yoga classes during the following weeks grew so
large that Mr. Wright was obliged to arrange a transfer to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">another</span>
hall.

The English tenacity has admirable expression in a <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span>
relationship. The London yoga students loyally organized themselves,
after my departure, into a Self-Realization Fellowship center,
holding their meditation meetings weekly throughout the bitter war
years.

Unforgettable weeks in England; <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t11 t20 t26 t27 hoverable">days</span> of sight-seeing in London,
then over the beautiful countryside. Mr. Wright and I summoned the
trusty Ford to visit the birthplaces and tombs of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> poets
and heroes of British history.

Our little party sailed from Southampton for America in late October
on the BREMEN. The majestic Statue of Liberty in <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">New</span> York harbor
<span class="t2 t4 t5 t22 t23 hoverable">brought</span> a joyous emotional gulp not only to the throats of Miss
Bletch and Mr. Wright, but to my own.

The Ford, a bit battered from struggles with ancient soils, was
still puissant; it now <span class="t4 hoverable">took</span> in its stride the transcontinental trip

to California. In late 1936, lo! Mount Washington.

The year-end holidays are celebrated annually at the Los Angeles
center with an eight-hour group meditation on December 24th
(Spiritual Christmas), followed the next <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> by a banquet (Social
Christmas). The festivities this year were augmented by the presence
of dear friends and students from distant cities who had arrived
to welcome home the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> travelers.

miles for this glad occasion: GUCCHI mushrooms from Kashmir, canned
RASAGULLA and mango pulp, PAPAR biscuits, and an oil of the Indian
KEORA flower which flavored our ice cream. The evening <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> us
grouped around a huge sparkling Christmas tree, the near-by fireplace
crackling with logs of aromatic cypress.

Gift-time! Presents from the earth's <span class="t6 t9 t18 t26 hoverable">far</span> corners-Palestine, Egypt,
India, England, France, Italy. How laboriously had Mr. Wright
counted the trunks at each foreign junction, that no pilfering <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t29 hoverable">hand</span>

embroideries from Belgium and Holland, Persian carpets, finely

pile under the tree.

"Sister Gyanamata!" I handed a <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> box to the saintly American
lady of sweet visage and deep realization who, during my absence,
had been in charge at Mt. Washington. From the paper tissues she
lifted a SARI of golden Benares silk.

"Thank you, sir; it brings the pageant of India before my eyes."

"Mr. Dickinson!" The next parcel contained a gift which I had
bought in a Calcutta bazaar. "Mr. Dickinson will <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> this," I had
<span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> at the time. A dearly beloved disciple, Mr. Dickinson had
been present at <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> Christmas festivity since the 1925 founding
of Mt. Washington. At this eleventh annual celebration, he was
standing before me, untying the ribbons of his square little package.

"The silver cup!" Struggling with emotion, he stared at the present,
a tall drinking cup. He seated himself some distance away, apparently

in a daze. I smiled at him affectionately before resuming my role
as Santa Claus.

The ejaculatory evening closed with a prayer to the Giver of all
gifts; then a group singing of Christmas carols.

Mr. Dickinson and I were chatting <span class="t16 t21 hoverable">together</span> sometime later.

"Sir," he said, "please <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">let</span> me thank you now for the silver cup.

"I <span class="t2 t4 t5 t22 t23 hoverable">brought</span> the gift especially for you."

"For forty-three <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span> I have been waiting for that silver cup! It
is a <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> story, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> I have kept hidden <span class="t5 t7 hoverable">within</span> me." Mr. Dickinson
looked at me shyly. "The beginning was dramatic: I was drowning.
My older brother had playfully pushed me into a fifteen-foot pool
in a small town in Nebraska. I was only five <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span> <span class="t25 hoverable">old</span> then. As I

the figure of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> with tranquil eyes and a reassuring smile.
My <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> was sinking for the third <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> when <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of my brother's

the bank and successfully gave me first-aid treatment.

"Twelve <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span> later, a youth of seventeen, I visited Chicago with
my mother. It was 1893; the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">World</span> Parliament of Religions
was in session. Mother and I were walking down a main street, when
again I saw the mighty flash of light. A few paces away, strolling
leisurely along, was the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> I had seen <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span> before in vision.
He approached a large auditorium and vanished <span class="t5 t7 hoverable">within</span> the door.

"'Mother,' I cried, 'that was the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> who appeared at the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> I

"She and I hastened into the building; the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> was seated on a

India. {FN47-1} After he had <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> a soul-stirring talk, I <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span>
forward to meet him. He smiled on me graciously, as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> we

expression to my feelings, but in my <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t16 t19 t22 t23 t25 t26 hoverable">heart</span> I was hoping that he

"'No, my son, I am not your guru.' Vivekananda gazed with his
beautiful, piercing eyes deep into my own. 'Your teacher will <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span>

added, smiling, 'He will pour out to you more blessings than you
are now able to hold.'

by soft strains of melody. A band of celestial beings, carrying

CHAPTER: 48

AT ENCINITAS IN CALIFORNIA

"A surprise, sir! During your absence abroad we have had this
Encinitas hermitage built; it is a 'welcome-home' gift!" Sister
Gyanamata smilingly led me through a gate and up a tree-shaded
walk.

I saw a building jutting out <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> white ocean liner toward

finally with man's insufficient vocabulary of joy and gratitude,
I examined the ashram-sixteen unusually large rooms, each <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span>
charmingly appointed.

The stately central hall, with immense ceiling-high windows, looks
out on a united altar of grass, ocean, sky-a symphony in emerald,
opal, sapphire. A mantle over the hall's huge fireplace holds the
framed likeness of Lahiri Mahasaya, smiling his blessing over this
<span class="t6 t9 t18 t26 hoverable">far</span> Pacific heaven.

Directly below the hall, built into the very bluff, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> solitary
meditation caves confront the infinities of sky and sea. Verandahs,
sun-bathing nooks, acres of orchard, a eucalypti grove, flagstone
paths leading through roses and lilies to quiet arbors, a <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span>
flight of stairs ending on an isolated beach and the vast waters!
Was dream <span class="t29 hoverable">ever</span> more concrete?

"May the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> and heroic and bountiful souls of the saints <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span>

reach me during my stay in India and Europe. Astonishment, delight!

During my earlier <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span> in America I had combed the coast of
California in quest of a small site for a seaside ashram; whenever I
had <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> a suitable location, some obstacle had invariably arisen
to thwart me. Gazing now over the broad acres of Encinitas, {FN48-1}
humbly I saw the effortless fulfillment of Sri Yukteswar's long-ago
prophecy: "a hermitage by the ocean."

A few months later, Easter of 1937, I conducted on the smooth lawns

at Encinitas the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> Sunrise Services. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Like</span> the magi of

lay the inexhaustible Pacific, booming its solemn praise; in the
distance, a tiny white sailing boat, and the lonely flight of a
seagull. "Christ, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thou</span> art risen!" Not alone with the vernal sun,

experience with the receptivity of Westerners to the quaintly

the time, April 18, 1926; the place, Carnegie Hall in <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">New</span> York.

"Mr. Hunsicker," I had confided to an American student, "I am planning
to ask the audience to sing an ancient Hindu chant, 'O <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> Beautiful!'"

"Sir," Mr. Hunsicker had protested, "these Oriental songs are alien
to American understanding. What a shame if the lecture were to be
marred by a commentary of overripe tomatoes!"

I had laughingly disagreed. "Music is a universal language.
Americans will not fail to feel the soul-aspiration in this lofty
chant." {FN48-2}

During the lecture Mr. Hunsicker had sat behind me on the platform,
probably fearing for my safety. His doubts were groundless; not
only had there been an absence of unwelcome vegetables, but for

"Premananda," I told him during a visit to his <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> temple, "this
Eastern headquarters is a memorial in stone to your tireless
devotion. Here in the nation's capital you have held aloft the

Premananda accompanied me from Washington for a brief visit to
the Self-Realization Fellowship center in Boston. What joy to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span>
again the KRIYA YOGA band who had remained steadfast since 1920!
The Boston leader, Dr. M. W. Lewis, lodged my companion and myself
in a modern, artistically decorated suite.

"Sir," Dr. Lewis <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to me, smiling, "during your early <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span> in
America you stayed in this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t22 t23 hoverable">city</span> in a single room, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> bath. I
wanted you to <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">know</span> that Boston possesses some luxurious apartments!"

The shadows of approaching carnage were lengthening over the world;
already the acute ear <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t18 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">might</span> hear the frightful drums of war. During
interviews with thousands in California, and through a world-wide
correspondence, I <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> and women were deeply searching
their hearts; the tragic outer insecurity had emphasized need for
the Eternal Anchorage.

"We have indeed learned the value of meditation," the leader of the
London Self-Realization Fellowship center wrote me in 1941, "and
<span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">know</span> that <span class="t15 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">nothing</span> can disturb our inner peace. In the last few weeks
during the meetings we have heard air-raid warnings and listened
to the explosion of delayed-action bombs, but our students still
gather and thoroughly enjoy our beautiful service."

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Another</span> letter reached me from war-torn England just before America
entered the conflict. In nobly pathetic words, Dr. L. Cranmer Byng,
noted editor of THE WISDOM OF THE EAST SERIES, wrote:

"When I read EAST-WEST I realized how <span class="t6 t9 t18 t26 hoverable">far</span> apart we seemed to be,
apparently living in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> <span class="t1 t2 t18 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">different</span> worlds. Beauty, order, calm,

a beleaguered city.

"I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> as in a dream your palm tree grove, and the temple at

distillment from the bitter herbs of war! To satisfy a growing
need, an inspiring little Self-Realization Church of All Religions
was built and dedicated in 1942 at Hollywood. The site faces Olive

in blue, white, and gold, is reflected amidst the <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> hyacinths
in a large pool. The gardens are gay with flowers, a few startled

stone deer, a stained-glass pergola, and a quaint wishing well.
Thrown in with the pennies and the kaleidoscopic wishes of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span>

the Last Supper.

1943 at San Diego. A quiet hilltop temple, it stands in a sloping

Sitting <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> evening in this tranquil haven, I was pouring out my
<span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t16 t19 t22 t23 t25 t26 hoverable">heart</span> in song. Under my fingers was the sweet-toned organ of the
church, on my lips the yearning plaint of an ancient Bengali devotee
who had searched for eternal solace:

In this world, Mother, none can <span class="t7 hoverable">love</span> me;
In this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> they do not <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">know</span> <span class="t7 hoverable">love</span> divine.
Where is there pure loving love?
Where is there truly loving Thee?
There my <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t16 t19 t22 t23 t25 t26 hoverable">heart</span> longs to be.

My companion in the chapel, Dr. Lloyd Kennell, the San Diego center
leader, was smiling a little at the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">words</span> of the song.

"Tell me truly, Paramhansaji, has it been worth it?" He gazed at
me with an earnest sincerity. I understood his laconic question:
"Have you been happy in America? What about the disillusionments,
the heartaches, the center leaders who <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> not lead, the students

"Blessed is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> whom the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> doth test, Doctor! He has remembered
now and then to <span class="t0 t2 t16 t18 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">put</span> a burden on me!" I thought, then, of all the
faithful ones, of the <span class="t7 hoverable">love</span> and devotion and understanding that
lay in the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t16 t19 t22 t23 t25 t26 hoverable">heart</span> of America. With slow emphasis I <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> on, "But my
answer is: Yes, a thousand times yes! It has been worth-while; it
has been a constant inspiration, more than <span class="t29 hoverable">ever</span> I dreamed, to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span>
West and East <span class="t2 t4 t5 t22 t23 hoverable">brought</span> closer in the only lasting bond, the spiritual!"

Silently I added a prayer: "May Babaji and Sri Yukteswarji feel
that I have done my part, not disappointing the high hope in which
they sent me forth."

I turned again to the organ; this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> my song was tinged with a
martial valor:

"A splendid idea, sir! The colony will surely be a success if
everyone sincerely does his part!"

"'World' is a large term, but <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> enlarge his allegiance,

Dr. Lewis and I halted above the lotus pool near the hermitage.
Below us lay the illimitable Pacific.

"These same waters break equally on the coasts of West and East,
in California and China." My companion threw a little stone into
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> of the oceanic seventy million square miles. "Encinitas

August 15, 1945, close of Global War II! <span class="t7 t10 t15 t25 hoverable">End</span> of a world; dawn of

Gone was the tension of war years; our spirits purred in the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t14 t23 t25 t28 hoverable">sun</span>

"Lord," I <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> gratefully, "Thou <span class="t16 t17 t22 hoverable">hast</span> <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> this monk a large
