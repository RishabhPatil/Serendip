Dhritarashtra said:
1:1. What did my (people) and the Pandavas do, O
Sangaya! when they assembled <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">holy</span>

Sangaya said:
1:2. Seeing the army of the Pandavas drawn up in battlearray, the prince Duryodhana approached his
preceptor, and spoke (these) words:
1:3. `O preceptor! observe this grand army of the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t13 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">sons</span> of

1:4. In it are heroes (bearing) large bows, the equals of
Bhima and Arguna in battle (namely),
Yuyudhana, Virata, and Drupada, the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>

1:7. And now, O best of Brahmanas! learn who are most
distinguished among us, and are leaders of my
army. I will name them to you, in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> that you may
know them well.
1:8. Yourself, and Bhishma, and Karna, and Kripa the
victor of (many) battles; Asvatthaman, and
Vikarna, and also the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> of Somadatta,

lives for me, who fight with various weapons,
(and are) all dexterous in battle.
1:10. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> our army which is protected by Bhishma is
unlimited; while this army of theirs which is

only.'
1:12. Then his powerful grandsire, Bhishma, the oldest of
the Kauravas, roaring aloud like a lion, blew
his conch, (thereby) affording delight to Duryodhana.
1:13. And then all at once, conchs, and kettledrums, and
tabors, and trumpets were played upon; and
there was a tumultuous din.
1:14. Then, too, Madhava and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> of Pandu
(Arguna), seated in a grand chariot to which white steeds
were yoked, blew their heavenly conchs.
1:15. Hrishikesa blew the Pankaganya, and
Dhanangaya the Devadatta, and Bhima, (the doer) of
fearful
deeds, blew the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> conch Paundra.

1:28. Seeing these kinsmen, O Krishna! standing (here)
anxious to engage in battle, my limbs droop
down:
1:29. my mouth is quite dried up; a tremor comes over
my body; and my hairs stand on end; the Gandiva
(bow) slips from my hand; my skin burns intensely.
1:30. I am unable, too, to stand up; my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> whirls

after killing (my) kinsmen in the battle. I do not
wish for victory, O Krishna! nor sovereignty, nor
pleasures:
1:32. what is sovereignty to us, O Govinda! what
enjoyments, and even life?
1:33. Even those, for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> sake we <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> sovereignty,

1:35. What joy shall be ours, O Ganardana! after killing
Dhritarishtra's sons?
1:36. Killing these felons we shall only incur sin.
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Therefore</span> it is not proper for us to kill our own
kinsmen, the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t13 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">sons</span> of Dhritarashtra. For how, O Madhava!
shall we be happy after killing our own
relatives?
1:37. Although they have their consciences corrupted by
avarice, they do not see the evils flowing from
the extinction of a family, and the <span class="t0 t9 t11 t14 t17 t28 hoverable">sin</span> in treachery to
friends;
5

1:38. still, O Ganardana! should not we, who do see the
evils flowing from the extinction of a family,
learn to refrain from that sin?
1:39. On the extinction of a family, the <span class="t20 hoverable">eternal</span> rites of
families are destroyed. Those rites being
destroyed, impiety predominates over the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> family.
1:40. In consequence of the predominance of impiety, O
Krishna! the women of the family become
corrupt; and the women becoming corrupt, O descendant
of Vrishni! intermingling of castes results;
1:41. that intermingling necessarily leads the family and
the destroyers of the family to hell; for when the
ceremonies of (offering) the balls of <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> (to
them) fail, their ancestors fall down (to hell).
1:42. By these transgressions of the destroyers of
families, which occasion interminglings of castes, the

grieve not for the living nor the dead.
2:12. Never did I not exist, nor you, nor these rulers of
men; nor will any one of us ever hereafter cease to
be.
2:13. As in this body, infancy and youth and old age
(come) to the embodied (self), so does the
acquisition of another body; a sensible <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> is not

2:16. There is no <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> for that which is unreal; there

the (correct) conclusion about both is perceived by those

everlasting, all-pervading, stable, firm, and eternal. It is

their end again is unperceived. What (occasion is there

2:33. But if you will not fight this righteous battle, then
you will have abandoned your own duty and your

2:34. All beings, too, will tell of your everlasting infamy;
and to one who has been honoured, infamy is
(a) greater (evil) than death.
2:35. (Warriors who are) masters of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> cars will think

And what, indeed, more lamentable than that?

(repeated) births, repair to that seat where there is no

have heard, will stand firm and steady in
contemplation, then will you acquire devotion.

obtained.
4:13. The fourfold division of castes was <span class="t16 hoverable">created</span> by me

4:16. Even sages are confused as to what is action, what
inaction. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Therefore</span> I will <span class="t9 t11 t20 t21 t22 t23 t27 hoverable">speak</span> to you about

4:20. Forsaking all attachment to the fruit of action,
always contented, dependent on none, he does
nothing at all, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> he engages in action.

not fettered down, even <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> he performs

some offer up the <span class="t2 t9 t10 t16 t18 t19 t27 t28 hoverable">sacrifice</span> by the <span class="t2 t9 t10 t16 t18 t19 t27 t28 hoverable">sacrifice</span> itself in

hearing and others, in the fires of restraint; others
offer up the objects of sense, such as sound and so forth,
into the fires of the senses.
4:27. Some again offer up all the operations of the
senses and the operations of the life-breaths into the

others are ascetics of rigid vows.
4:29. Some offer up the upward life-breath into the
downward life-breath, and the downward life-breath
into the upper life-breath, and stopping up the motions of
the upward and downward life-breaths, devote
themselves to the restraint of the life-breaths. Others,
who (take) limited food, offer up the life-breaths
into the life-breaths.
4:30. All of these, conversant with the sacrifice, have
their sins destroyed by the sacrifice. Those who <span class="t28 hoverable">eat</span>

The Deity said:
5:2. Renunciation and pursuit of action are both
instruments of happiness. But of the two, pursuit of
action is superior to renunciation of action.

The Deity said:

the actions which ought to be performed, is the

who has not renounced (all) fancies.

6:3. To the sage who wishes to rise to devotion, action is
said to be a means, and to him, when be has
risen to devotion, tranquillity is said to be a means.
6:4. When one does not attach oneself to objects of
sense, nor to action, renouncing all fancies, then one
is said to have risen to devotion.
6:5. (A man) should elevate his self by his self; he should
not debase his self, for even (a man's) own self
is his friend, (a man's) own self is also his enemy.
6:6. To him who has subjugated his self by his self, his
self is a friend; but to him who has not restrained
his self, his own self behaves inimically, like an enemy.
6:7. The self of one who has subjugated his self and is
tranquil, is absolutely concentrated (on itself), in

6:24. Abandoning, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> exception, all desires, which

firm resolve coupled with courage; and fixing

forth, there one should ever restrain it, and fix it
steadily on the self alone.
6:27. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> happiness comes to such a devotee,

of passion has been suppressed, who is <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> from sin,

devotee, freed from sin, easily obtains that
supreme happiness-contact with the Brahman.
6:29. He who has devoted his self to abstraction, by
devotion, looking alike on everything, sees the self
abiding in all beings, and all <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> in the self.
6:30. To him who sees me in everything, and everything
in me, I am never lost, and he is not lost to me.
6:31. The devotee who worships me abiding in all
beings, holding that all is one, lives in me, however he
may be living.
6:32. That devotee, O Arguna! is deemed to be the best,
who looks alike on pleasure or pain, whatever it
may be, in all (creatures), comparing all with his own
(pleasure or pain).
Arguna said:

29

6:33. I cannot see, O destroyer of Madhu! (how) the
sustained <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> (is to be secured) of this devotion
by means of equanimity which you have declared in
consequence of fickleness.
6:34. For, O Krishna! the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> is fickle, boisterous,
strong, and obstinate; and I think that to restrain it is
as difficult as (to restrain) the wind.
The Deity said:
6:35. Doubtless, O you of mighty arms! the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> is
difficult to restrain, and fickle. Still, O <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> of Kunti!
it may be restrained by constant practice and by
indifference (to worldly objects).
6:36. It is my belief, that devotion is hard to obtain for
one who does not restrain his self. But by one who
is self-restrained and assiduous, it can be obtained
through (proper) expedients.
Arguna, said:
6:37. What is the end of him, O Krishna! who does not
attain the consummation of his devotion, being
not assiduous, and having a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> shaken off from
devotion, (though) <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span> of faith?
6:38. Does he, fallen from both (paths), go to ruin like a
broken cloud, being, O you of mighty arms!
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> support, and deluded on the path (leading) to the
Brahman?
6:39. Be pleased, O Krishna! to entirely destroy this
doubt of mine, for none else than you can destroy
this doubt.
The Deity said:
6:40. O <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> of Pritha neither in this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> nor the next, is

6:41. He who is fallen from devotion attains the worlds of
those who perform meritorious acts, dwells
30

(there) for many a year, and is afterwards <span class="t16 t24 hoverable">born</span> into a
family of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">holy</span> and illustrious men.
6:42. Or he is even <span class="t16 t24 hoverable">born</span> into a family of talented
devotees; for such a birth as that in this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> is more
difficult to obtain.
6:43. There he comes into contact with the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span>

perfection.
6:44. For even <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> reluctant, he is led away by the
self-same former practice, and although he only
wishes to learn devotion, he rises above the (fruits of
action laid down in the) <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> word.
6:45. But the devotee working with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> efforts, and
cleared of his sins, attains perfection after many
births, and then reaches the supreme goal.
6:46. The devotee is esteemed <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> than the
performers of penances, <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> even than the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> of

6:47. And even among all devotees, he who, being <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span> of
faith, worships me, with his inmost self intent
on me, is esteemed by me to be the most devoted.

11:21. For here these groups of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> are entering into
you. Some being afraid are praying with joined
hands, and the groups of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> sages and Siddhas are
saying `Welfare!' and praising you with abundant
(hymns) of praise.
11:22. The Rudras, and Adityas, the Vasus, the
Sadhyas, the Visvas, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> Asvins, the Maruts, and the
Ushmapas, and the groups of Gandharvas, Yakshas,
demons, and Siddhas are all looking at you amazed.
11:23. Seeing your mighty form, with many mouths and
eyes, with many arms, thighs, and feet, with
many stomachs, and fearful with many jaws, all people,
and I like-wise, are much alarmed, O you of
mighty arms!
11:24. Seeing you, O Vishnu! touching the skies, radiant,
possessed of many hues, with a gaping mouth,
and with large blazing eyes, I am much alarmed in my
inmost self, and feel no courage, no tranquillity.
47

11:25. And seeing your mouths terrible by the jaws, and
resembling the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> of destruction, I cannot
recognise the (various) directions, I feel no comfort. Be
gracious, O <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">lord</span> of gods! who pervadest the

principal warriors also,
11:27. are rapidly entering your mouths, fearful and
horrific by (reason of your) jaws. And some with
their heads smashed are seen (to be) stuck in the spaces
between the teeth.
11:28. As the many rapid currents of a river's waters run
towards the sea alone, so do these heroes of the

11:29. As butterflies, with increased velocity, enter a
blazing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> to their destruction, so too do these

their destruction.
11:30. Swallowing all these people, you are licking them
over and over again from all sides, with your
blazing mouths. Your fierce splendours, O Vishnu! filling
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> universe with (their) effulgence, are
heating it.
11:31. Tell me who you are in this fierce form.
Salutations be to thee, O chief of the gods! Be gracious. I
wish to know you, the primeval one, for I do not
understand your actions.
The Deity said:
11:32. I am death, the destroyer of the worlds, fully
developed, and I am now active about the overthrow
of the worlds. Even <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> you, the warriors standing in
the adverse hosts, shall all cease to be.

instrument, O Savyasakin!
11:34. Drona, and Bhishma, and Gayadratha, and Karna,
and likewise other valiant warriors also, whom
I have killed, do you kill. Be not alarmed. Do fight. And
in the battle you will conquer (your) foes.
Sangaya said:
11:35. Hearing these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> of Kesava, the wearer of the
coronet, trembling, and with joined hands,

Arguna said:
11:36. It is quite proper, O Hrishikesa! that the universe
is delighted and charmed by your renown, that
the demons run away affrighted in all directions, and that
all the assemblages of Siddhas bow down (to

11:37. And why, O high-souled one! should they not bow
down to you (who are) greater than Brahman,

the universe! you are the indestructible, that
which is, that which is not, and what is beyond them.
11:38. You are the primal god, the ancient being, you are
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> support of this universe. You are
that which has knowledge, that which is the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of
knowledge, you are the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> goal. By you is this

greatness (as shown in) this (universal form),

12:10. If you are unequal even to continuous meditation,
then let acts for (propitiating) me be your

me, you will attain perfection.
12:11. If you are unable to do even this, then resort to
devotion to me, and, with self-restraint, abandon
all fruit of action.
12:12. For <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> is better than continuous

assiduous, impartial, <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> from distress, who

and no aversion, who does not grieve and does
not desire, who abandons (both what is) agreeable and
(what is) disagreeable, he is dear to me.
12:18. He who is alike to friend and foe, as also in
honour and dishonour, who is alike in cold and heat,
pleasure and pain, who is <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> from attachments,
12:19. to whom praise and blame are alike, who is
taciturn, and contented with anything whatever (that

14:2. Those who, resorting to this knowledge, reach
assimilation with my essence, are not <span class="t16 t24 hoverable">born</span> at the
creation, and are not afflicted at the destruction (of the

14:5. Goodness, passion, darkness, these qualities <span class="t16 t24 hoverable">born</span>
from nature, O you of mighty arms! bind down
the inexhaustible <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> in the body.
14:6. Of these, goodness, which, in consequence of
being untainted, is enlightening and <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> from (all)
misery, binds the soul, O sinless one! with the bond of
pleasure and the bond of knowledge.
14:7. Know that passion consists in being enamoured,
and is produced from craving and attachment.
That, O <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> of Kunti! binds down the embodied (self) with
the bond of action.
14:8. Darkness (you must) know to be <span class="t16 t24 hoverable">born</span> of ignorance,
it deludes all embodied (selfs). And that, O
descendant of Bharata! binds down (the self) with
heedlessness, indolence, and sleep.
14:9. Goodness unites (the self) with pleasure; passion,
O descendant of Bharata! with action; and
darkness with heedlessness, after shrouding up
knowledge.
14:10. Passion and darkness being repressed, goodness
stands, O descendant of Bharata! Passion and
goodness (being repressed), darkness; and likewise
darkness and goodness (being repressed), passion.
14:11. When in this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> at all portals <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> (that is to say)

goodness to be developed.
14:12. Avarice, activity, performance of actions, want of
tranquillity, desire, these are produced, O chief
of the descendants of Bharata! when passion is
developed.
14:13. Want of light, want of activity heedlessness, and
delusion, these are produced, O descendant of
Kuru! when darkness is developed.
14:14. When an embodied (self) encounters death, while
goodness is developed, then he reaches the
untainted worlds of those who know the highest.
58

14:15. Encountering <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">death</span> during (the prevalence of)
passion, he is <span class="t16 t24 hoverable">born</span> among those attached to action.
Likewise, dying during (the prevalence of) darkness, he is
<span class="t16 t24 hoverable">born</span> in the wombs of the ignorant.
14:16. The fruit of meritorious action is said to be good,
untainted; while the fruit of passion is misery;
and the fruit of darkness ignorance.
14:17. From goodness is produced knowledge, from
passion avarice, and from darkness heedlessness and
delusion and ignorance also.
14:18. Those who adhere to (the ways of) goodness go
up; the passionate remain in the middle; while
those of the qualities of darkness, adhering to the ways of
the lowest quality, go down.
14:19. When a right-seeing <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> sees none but the
qualities (to be) the doers (of all action), and knows
what is above the qualities, he enters into my essence.
14:20. The embodied (self), who transcends these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span>

and misery.
Arguna said:
14:21. What are the characteristics, O lord! of one who
has transcended these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> qualities? What is

The Deity said:

perturbed by the qualities; who remains steady and
moves not, (thinking) merely that the qualities exist; who
is self-contained;
59

14:24. to whom pain and pleasure are alike; to whom a
sod and a stone and gold are alike; to whom what
is agreeable and what is disagreeable are alike; who has
discernment;
14:25. to whom censure and praise of himself are alike;
who is alike in honour and dishonour; who is
alike towards the sides of friends and foes; and who
abandons all action.
14:26. And he who worships me with an unswerving
devotion, transcends these qualities, and becomes fit
for (entrance into) the essence of the Brahman.
14:27. For I am the embodiment of the Brahman, of
indefeasible immortality, of <span class="t20 hoverable">eternal</span> piety, and of
unbroken happiness.

birth, they go down to the vilest state, O <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> of

under the impulse of desire, does not attain

Arguna said:
17:1. What is the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of those, O Krishna! who worship
with faith, (but) abandoning scripture
ordinances goodness, passion, or darkness?
The Deity said:

darkness. Hear about it.
17:3. The <span class="t4 t7 t12 t16 hoverable">faith</span> of all, O descendant of Bharata! is
conformable to the heart. A being here is <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span> of faith,

17:4. Those of the quality of goodness worship the gods;

Rakshases; and the others, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> of the quality of

multitudes of Bhutas.
17:5. Know those to-be of demoniac convictions, who
practise fierce penance not ordained by scripture;
who are <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span> of ostentatiousness and egoism, and of
desire, attachment, and stubbornness; who are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span>

sacrifice, the penance, and gifts, are of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span>

follows.
17:8. The kinds of <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> which increase life, energy,
strength, health, comfort, and relish, which are
savoury, oleaginous, <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span> of nutrition, and agreeable, are
liked by the good.
65

17:9. The kinds of <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> which are bitter, acid, saltish, too
hot, sharp, rough, and burning, and which
cause pain, grief, and disease, are desired by the
passionate.
17:10. And the <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> which is cold, tasteless, stinking,
stale, impure, and even leavings, are liked by the
dark.
17:11. That <span class="t2 t9 t10 t16 t18 t19 t27 t28 hoverable">sacrifice</span> is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> which, being prescribed in

that <span class="t2 t9 t10 t16 t18 t19 t27 t28 hoverable">sacrifice</span> (to be) passionate.

17:15. The speech which causes no sorrow, which is
true, agreeable, and beneficial, and the study of the
Vedas, (this) is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the penance vocal.
17:16. Calmness of mind, mildness, taciturnity, selfrestraint, and purity of heart, this is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the
penance mental.
17:17. This threefold penance, practised with perfect
faith, by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> who do not wish for the fruit, and who
are possessed of devotion, is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> good.
17:18. The penance which is done for respect, honour,
and reverence, and with ostentatiousness, and
66

which is uncertain and transient, is here <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span>
passionate.
17:19. And that penance is described as dark, which is
performed under a misguided conviction, with
pain to oneself, or for the destruction of another.
17:20. That gift is said (to be) good, which is given,
because it ought to be given, to one who (can) do no
service (in return), at a (proper) <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> and time, and to a
(proper) person.
17:21. But that gift which is given with much difficulty, for
a return of services, or even with an
expectation of fruit, is said to be passionate.
17:22. And that gift is described as dark, which is given
to unfit persons, at an unfit <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> and time,

17:23. Om, Tad, and Sat, this is said (to be) the threefold
designation of the Brahman. By that, the
Brahmanas and the Vedas and sacrifices were <span class="t16 hoverable">created</span> in
olden times.
17:24. Hence, the performance by those who study the
Brahman, of sacrifices, gifts, and penances,
prescribed by the ordinances (of scripture, always
commence after saying `Om.'
17:25. Those who <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> final emancipation perform the
various acts of <span class="t2 t9 t10 t16 t18 t19 t27 t28 hoverable">sacrifice</span> and penance, and the
various acts of gift, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> expectation of fruit, after
(saying) `Tad.'
17:26. `Sat' is employed to express <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> and
goodness; and likewise, O <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> of Pritha! the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> `Sat'
is <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> to express an auspicious act.
17:27. Constancy in (making) sacrifices, penances, and
gifts, is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> `Sat'; and (all) action, too, of
which that is the object, is also <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> `Sat.'

whatever penance is performed, and whatever is

done, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> faith, that, O <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> of Pritha! is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> `Asat,'

18:1. O you of mighty arms! O Hrishikesa! O destroyer

renunciation and abandonment distinctly.
The Deity said:
18:2. By renunciation the sages understand the rejection
of actions done with desires. The <span class="t8 t12 t17 hoverable">wise</span> <span class="t3 t11 t18 t27 hoverable">call</span> the
abandonment of the fruit of all actions (by the name)
abandonment.
18:3. Some <span class="t8 t12 t17 hoverable">wise</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> say, that action should be
abandoned as being <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span> of evil; and others, that the
actions of sacrifice, gift, and penance should not be
abandoned.
18:4. As to that abandonment, O best of the descendants
of Bharata! listen to my decision; for
abandonment, O bravest of men! is described (to be)
threefold.
18:5. The actions of sacrifice, gift, and penance should
not be abandoned; they must needs be performed;
for sacrifices, gifts, and penances are means of
sanctification to the wise.
18:6. But even these actions, O <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> of Pritha! should be
performed, abandoning attachment and fruit;
such is my excellent and decided opinion.
18:7. The renunciation of prescribed action is not proper.
Its abandonment through delusion I is
described as of the quality of darkness.
18:8. When a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> abandons action, merely as being
troublesome, through <span class="t28 hoverable">fear</span> of bodily affliction, he
68

does not obtain the fruit of abandonment by making
(such) passionate abandonment.
18:9. When prescribed action is performed, O Arguna!
abandoning attachment and fruit also, merely
because it ought to be performed, that is deemed (to be)
a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> abandonment.
18:10. He who is possessed of abandonment, being <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span>
of goodness, and talented, and having his doubts
destroyed, is not averse from unpleasant actions, is not
attached to pleasant (ones).
18:11. Since no embodied (being) can abandon actions
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> exception, he is said to be possessed of
abandonment, who abandons the fruit of action.
18:12. The threefold fruit of action, agreeable,
disagreeable, and mixed, accrues after <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">death</span> to those
who
are not possessed of abandonment, but never to
renouncers.
18:13. Learn from me, O you of mighty arms! these five
causes of the completion of all actions, declared
in the Sankhya system.
18:14. The substratum, the agent likewise, the various
sorts of organs, and the various and distinct
movements, and with these the deities, too, as the fifth.
18:15. Whatever action, just or otherwise, a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span>
performs with his body, speech, and mind, these five are
its causes.
18:16. That being so, the undiscerning man, who being
of an unrefined understanding, sees the agent in
the immaculate self, sees not (rightly).
18:17. He who has no feeling of egoism, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span>

people, kills not, is not fettered (by the action).
18:18. Knowledge, the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of knowledge, the knower
threefold is the prompting to action. The
69

instrument, the action, the agent, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> in brief is action

the enumeration of qualities (to be) of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span>

Hear about these also as they really are.
18:20. Know that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> to be good, by which (a
man) sees one entity, inexhaustible, and not
different in all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> (apparently) different (from one

devoid of reason, devoid of real principle, and
insignificant.
18:23. That action is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> good, which is prescribed,
which is devoid of attachment, which is not done
from (motives of) affection or aversion, (and which is
done) by one not wishing for the fruit.
18:24. That is described as passionate, which
(occasions) much trouble, is performed by one who
wishes
for objects of desire, or one who is <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span> of egotism.
18:25. The action is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> dark, which is commenced

attachment, who is <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> from egotistic talk, who is

That agent is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> dark, who is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span>

18:29. Now hear, O Dhanangaya! the threefold division
of <span class="t14 t24 hoverable">intelligence</span> and courage, according to
qualities, which I am about to declare exhaustively and
distinctly.
18:30. That intelligence, O <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> of Pritha! is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> which

which is unswerving, and by which one controls
the operations of the mind, breath, and senses, through
abstraction.
18:34. But, O Arguna! that courage is passionate, by
which one adheres to piety, lust, and wealth, and
through attachment wishes, O <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> of Pritha! for the fruit.
18:35. That courage is dark, O <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> of Pritha! by which an

sorrow, despondency, and folly.
18:36. Now, O chief of the descendants of Bharata! hear
from me about the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> sorts of happiness.

pleased after repetition (of enjoyment), and reaches
the close of all misery, which is like poison first and
comparable to nectar in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> run, and which is

18:39. That happiness is described as dark, which arises
from sleep, laziness, heedlessness, which
deludes the self, both at first and in its consequences.
18:40. There is no entity either on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> or in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heaven</span>

qualities <span class="t16 t24 hoverable">born</span> of nature.
18:41. The duties of Brahmanas, Kshatriyas, and
Vaisyas, and of Sudras, too, O terror of your foes! are
distinguished according to the qualities <span class="t16 t24 hoverable">born</span> of nature.
18:42. Tranquillity, restraint of the senses, penance,
purity, forgiveness, straightforwardness, also
knowledge, experience, and belief (in a future world), this
is the natural duty of Brahmanas.
18:43. Valour, glory, courage, dexterity, not slinking away
from battle, gifts, exercise of lordly power,
this is the natural duty of Kshatriyas.
18:44. Agriculture, tending cattle, trade, (this) is the
natural duty of Vaisyas. And the natural duty of
Sudras, too, consists in service.
18:45. (Every) <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> intent on his own respective duties
obtains perfection. Listen, now, how one intent
on one's own duty obtains perfection.
18:46. Worshipping, by (the performance of) his own
duty, him from whom all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> proceed, and by
whom all this is permeated, a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> obtains perfection.
18:47. One's duty, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> defective, is better than

18:48. Performing the duty prescribed by nature, one
does not incur sin. O <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> of Kunti! one should not
abandon a natural duty <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> tainted with evil; for all
actions are enveloped by evil, as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> by smoke.

18:49. One who is self-restrained, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> understanding
is unattached everywhere, from whom affections
have departed, obtains the supreme perfection of
freedom from action by renunciation.
18:50. Learn from me, only in brief, O <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> of Kunti! how
one who has obtained perfection attains the
Brahman, which is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> culmination of knowledge.
18:51. A <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> possessed of a pure understanding,
controlling his self by courage, discarding sound and
other objects of sense, casting off affection and aversion;

always intent on <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> and mental abstraction, and
has recourse to unconcern,
18:53. who abandoning egoism, stubbornness,
arrogance, desire, anger, and (all) belongings, has no
(thought that this or that is) mine, and who is tranquil,
becomes fit for assimilation with the Brahman.
18:54. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> reaching the Brahman, and with a tranquil
self, he grieves not, wishes not; but being alike to
all beings, obtains the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> devotion to me.
18:55. By (that) devotion he truly understands who I am
and how great. And then understanding me
truly, he forthwith enters into my (essence).
18:56. Even performing all actions, always depending on
me, he, through my favour, obtains the
imperishable and <span class="t20 hoverable">eternal</span> seat.
18:57. Dedicating in <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> all actions to me, be
constantly given up to me, (placing) your thoughts on
me, through recourse to mental abstraction.
18:58. (Placing) your thoughts on me, you will cross over
all difficulties by my favour. But if you will not
listen through egotism, you will be ruined.
18:59. If entertaining egotism, you think that you may not
fight, vain, indeed, is that resolution of yours.

in every way; by his favour you will obtain the

certainly come to me. I declare to you truly, you are dear

18:66. Forsaking all duties, come to me as (your) sole

18:67. This you should never declare to one who
performs no penance, who is not a devotee, nor to one
who does not wait on (some preceptor), nor <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> to one

of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> is water, the essence of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> the

speech, the essence of speech the Rig-veda, the
essence of the Rig-veda the Sama-veda, the essence of
the Sama-veda the udgitha (which is Om).
1-1:3. That udgitha (Om) is the best of all essences, the
highest, deserving the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> place, the eighth.
1-1:4. What then is the Rik? What is the Saman? What
is the udgitha? This is the question.
1-1:5. The Rik indeed is speech, Saman is breath, the
udgitha is the syllable Om. Now speech and
breath, or Rik and Saman, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> one couple.

Om.

1-1:8. That syllable is a syllable of permission, for
whenever we permit anything, we say Om, yes. Now
permission is gratification. He who knowing this
meditates on the syllable (Om), the udgitha, becomes
indeed a gratifier of desires.
1-1:9. By that syllable does the threefold <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> (the

proceeds by the greatness of that syllable (the vital
breaths), and by its essence (the oblations).
1-1:10.

<span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">Second</span> Khanda
1-2:1. When the Devas and Asuras struggled together,
both of the race of Pragapati, the Devas <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> the
udgitha (Om), thinking they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> vanquish the Asuras
with it.
1-2:2. They meditated on the udgitha (Om) as the breath
(scent) in the nose, but the Asuras pierced it (the
breath) with evil. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Therefore</span> we smell by the breath in the
nose both what is good-smelling and what is
bad-smelling. For the breath was pierced by evil.
1-2:3. Then they meditated on the udgitha (Om) as
speech, but the Asuras pierced it with evil. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Therefore</span>

pierced by evil.

1-2:4. Then they meditated on the udgitha (Om) as the
eye, but the Asuras pierced it with evil. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Therefore</span>
we see both what is sightly and unsightly. For the eye is
pierced by evil.
1-2:5. Then they meditated on the udgitha (Om) as the
ear, but the Asuras pierced it with evil. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Therefore</span>
we hear both what should be <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> and what should not
be heard. For the ear is pierced by evil.
1-2:6. Then they meditated on the udgitha (Om) as the
mind, but the Asuras pierced it with evil.
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Therefore</span> we conceive both what should be conceived

pierced by evil.
1-2:7. Then comes this breath (of life) in the mouth. They
meditated on the udgitha (Om) as that breath.
When the Asuras came to it, they were scattered, as (a
ball of earth) <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be scattered when hitting a
solid stone.
1-2:8. Thus, as a ball of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> is scattered when hitting

is a solid stone.
1-2:9. By it (the breath in the mouth) he distinguishes
neither what is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> nor what is bad-smelling, for
that breath is <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> from evil. What we <span class="t28 hoverable">eat</span> and drink with it
supports the other vital breaths (i.e. the
senses, such as smell, &c.)

1-2:10. Angiras meditated on the udgitha (Om) as that
breath, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> hold it to be Angiras, i.e. the

Udgatri (singer) of the Naimishiya-sacrificers, and
by singing he obtained for them their wishes.
1-2:14. He who knows this, and meditates on the syllable
Om (the imperishable udgitha) as the breath of
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> in the mouth, he obtains all wishes by singing. So
much for the udgitha (Om) as meditated on with

1-3:1. Now follows the <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on the udgitha with
reference to the gods. Let a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> meditate on the

the <span class="t28 hoverable">fear</span> of darkness (ignorance).
1-3:2. This (the breath in the mouth) and that (the sun)

Because the Devas entered it, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> they became

he is Saman, Uktha, Yagus, Brahman. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span>

Pravahana Gaivali. They said: `We are well-versed in

1-8:2. They all agreed and sat down. Then Pravahana
Gaivali said: `Sirs, do you both <span class="t9 t11 t20 t21 t22 t23 t27 hoverable">speak</span> first, for I

1-8:3. Then Silaka Salavatya said to Kaikitayana
Dalbhya: `Let me ask you.'
`Ask,' he replied.
1-8:4. `What is the origin of the Saman?' `Tone (svara),'
he replied.
`What is the origin of tone?' `Breath,' he replied.
`What is the origin of breath?' `Food,' he replied.
`What is the origin of food?' `Water,' he replied.
1-8:5. `What is the origin of water?' `That <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span>

`And what is the origin of that world?'
He replied: `Let no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> carry the Saman beyond the

as svarga (heaven).'
1-8:6. Then said Silaka Salavatya to Kaikitayana
Dalbhya: `O Dalbhya, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thy</span> Saman is not firmly

`Know it,' replied Silaka Salavatya.

1-8:8. Then said Pravahana Gaivali to Silaka Salavatya:
`Your Saman (the earth), O Salavatya, has an

`Well then, let me know this from you, Sir,' said

He who knowing this meditates on the udgitha, the

Section 10
Tenth Khanda
1-10:1. When the Kurus had been destroyed by (hail)
stones, Ushasti Kakrayana lived as a beggar with
his virgin wife at Ibhyagrama.
1-10:2. Seeing a chief eating beans, he begged of him.
The chief said: `I have no more, except those
86

which are put away for me here.'
1-10:3. Ushasti said: `Give me to <span class="t28 hoverable">eat</span> of them.' He gave
him the beans, and said: `There is something to
drink also.' Then said Ushasti: `If I drank of it, I should
have drunk what was <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> by another, and is
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> unclean.'
1-10:4. The chief said: `Were not those beans also <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span>

`No,' he replied; `for I should not have lived, if I had not
eaten them, but the drinking of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be

1-10:5. Having eaten himself, Ushasti gave the
remaining beans to his wife. But she, having eaten
before, <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> them and put them away.
1-10:6. Rising the next morning, Ushasti said to her:

gain a little wealth. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> here is going to offer a

1-10:7. His wife said to him: `Look, here are those beans
of yours.' Having eaten them, he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> to the

Udgatris, who were going to sing their hymns of
praise. And he said to the Prastotri (the leader):
1-10:9. `Prastotri, if you, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> knowing the deity which

Prastotri), are going to sing it, your <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> will fall off.'

`Udgatri, if you, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> knowing the deity which
belongs to the udgitha (the hymns of the Udgatri), are
going to sing it, your <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> will fall off.'
1-10:11. In the same manner he addressed the
Pratihartri: `Pratihartri, if you, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> knowing the deity

They stopped, and sat down in silence.

Eleventh Khanda
1-11:1. Then the sacrificer said to him: `I should like to
know who you are, Sir.' He replied: `I am
Ushasti Kakrayana.'
1-11:2. He said: `I looked for you, Sir, for all these
sacrificial offices, but not finding you, I chose others.'
1-11:3. `But now, Sir, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> all the sacrificial offices.'
Ushasti said: `Very well; but let those, with my
permission, perform the hymns of praise. Only as much
wealth as you give to them, so much give to me also.'
The sacrificer assented.
1-11:4. Then the Prastotri approached him, saying: `Sir,
you said to me, "Prastotri, if you, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span>
knowing the deity which belongs to the prastava, are
going to sing it, your <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> will fall off," which
then is that deity?'
1-11:5. He said: `Breath (prana). For all these <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span>
merge into breath alone, and from breath they
arise. This is the deity belonging to the prastava. If,

1-11:6. Then the Udgatri approached him, saying: `Sir,
you said to me, "Udgatri, if you, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> knowing

1-11:7. He said: `The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> (Aditya). For all these <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span>

3-19:1. Aditya (the sun) is Brahman, this is the doctrine,
and this is the fuller <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of it:
In the beginning this was non-existent. It became

were one of silver, the other of gold.
3-19:2. The silver one became this earth, the golden one
the sky, the thick membrane (of the white) the
mountains, the thin membrane (of the yoke) the mist with
the clouds, the small veins the rivers, the fluid
the sea.
3-19:3. And what was <span class="t16 t24 hoverable">born</span> from it that was Aditya, the

4-1:2. Once in the night some Hamsas (flamingoes) flew
over his house, and one flamingo said to
another: `Hey, Bhallaksha, Bhallaksha (short-sighted
friend). The <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> (glory) of Ganasruti Pautrayana

4-1:3. The other answered him: `How can you <span class="t9 t11 t20 t21 t22 t23 t27 hoverable">speak</span> of
him, being what he is (a raganya, noble), as if he
were like Raikva with the car?'
4-1:4. The first replied: `How is it with this Raikva with the
car of whom <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thou</span> speakest?'
The other answered: `As (in a game of dice) all the lower

4-1:5. Ganasruti Pautrayana overheard this
conversation, and as soon as he had risen in the
morning, he

said to his door-keeper (kshattri): `Friend, dost <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thou</span> <span class="t9 t11 t20 t21 t22 t23 t27 hoverable">speak</span>

He answered: `Here I am.'
Then the door-keeper returned, and said: `I have found

only by that mouth did you make me speak.'
These are the Raikva-parna villages in the country of the
Mahavrishas (mahapunyas) where Raikva dwelt
under him. And he said to him:

4-3:1. `Air (vayu) is indeed the end of all. For when <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span>

Kakshaseni were being waited on at their meal, a

nothing.

food). <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Therefore</span> in all quarters those ten are <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> (and)

of serpents or poisons, and the sciences of the

They, after having adorned themselves, having put on
their best clothes and cleaned themselves, looked

8-12:1. `Maghavat, this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> is mortal and always held

immortal and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> body.

held by pleasure and pain. So <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> as he is in the body,

different from the body), then neither pleasure nor

`Like as a horse attached to a cart, so is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> (prana,
pragnatman) attached to this body.
8-12:4. `Now where the sight has entered into the void
(the open space, the black pupil of the eye), there
is the <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> of the eye, the eye itself is the instrument of
seeing. He who knows, let me smell this, he is
the Self, the nose is the instrument of smelling. He who
knows, let me say this, he is the Self, the tongue
is the instrument of saying. He who knows, let me hear
this, he is the Self, the ear is the instrument of
hearing.
8-12:5. `He who knows, let me think this, he is the Self,

He, the Self, seeing
these pleasures (which to others are hidden like a buried

Immortal, the Self.
I come to the hall of Pragapati, to the house; I am the

glorious among men. I obtained that glory, I am glorious

8-15:1. Brahma (Hiranyagarbha or Paramesvara) told
this to Pragapati (Kasyapa), Pragapati to Manu (his
son), Manu to mankind. He who has learnt the Veda from
a family of teachers, according to the sacred
rule, in the leisure <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> from the duties to be

regularly in some sacred spot, who has begotten virtuous

never giving pain to any creature, except at the tirthas

5-10:8. Note: In this manner all the five questions have
been answered. First why in the fifth oblation

death, some by the path of the Devas, others by
the path of the fathers, others again by neither of these
paths; thirdly, how they return, some returning to
Brahman, others returning to the earth; fourthly, where
the paths of the Devas and the fathers diverge,
viz. when from the half-year the path of the Devas goes
on to the year, while that of the fathers branches
off to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> of the fathers; fifthly, why that world, the
other world, does never become full, viz.
because <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> either go on to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> or return again to
this world.
Many questions are raised among Indian philosophers on
the exact <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> of certain passages occuring
in the preceding paragraphs. First, as to who is admitted
to the path of the Devas? Householders, who
know the secret doctrine of the five fires or the five
libations of the Agnihotra, as described above, while
other householders, who only perform the ordinary
sacrifices, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of their secret
meaning, go by the path of the fathers. Secondly, those
who have retired to the forest, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> worship
there consists in <span class="t4 t7 t12 t16 hoverable">faith</span> and austerities, i.e. Vanaprasthas
and Parivragakas, before they arrive at a
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> Brahman. The question then
arises, <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> religious students also enter the path
of the Devas? This is affirmed, because Puranas and
Smritis assert it, or because our text, if properly
understood, does not exclude it. Those, on the contrary
who know not only a conditioned, but the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span>
unconditioned Brahman, do not proceed on the path of
the Devas, but obtain <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> immediately.
Again, there is much difference of opinion whether, after a
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> has been in the moon, consuming his
works, he can be <span class="t16 t24 hoverable">born</span> again. Birth is the result of former
works, and if former <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> are altogether
consumed, there cna be no new birth. This, however, is
shown to be an erroneous view, because, besides
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> sacrificial works, the fruits of which are
consumed in the moon, there are other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> which
have to be enjoyed or expiated, as the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> may be, in a
new existence.

The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> difficulty or danger in the round of
transmigration arises when the rain has fructified the
earth,
and passes into herbs and trees, rice, corn, and beans.
For, first of all, some of the rain does not fructify at
once, but falls into rivers and into the sea, to be
swallowed up by the fishes and sea monsters. Then, only
after these have been dissolved in the sea, and after the
sea <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> has been attracted by the clouds, the rain
falls down again, it may be on desert or stony land. Here
it may be swallowed by snakes or deer, and these
may be swallowed by other animals, so that the round of
<span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> seems endless. Nor is this all. Some
rain may dry up, or be absorbed by bodies that cannot be
eaten. Then, if the rain is absorbed by rice, corn,
&c., and this be eaten, it may be eaten by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">children</span> or by

again lose the chance of a new birth. Lastly there is the
danger arising from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of the being in
whom the food, such as rice and corn, becomes a new
seed, and likewise from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of the mother.
All these chances have to be met before a new birth as a
Brahmana, Kshatriya, or Vaisya can be secured.
Another curious distinction is here made by Sankara in
his commentary. There are some, he says, who
assume the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of rice, corn, &c., not in their descent
from the <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> world, as described in the
Upanishad, but as a definite punishment for certain <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span>
deeds they have committed. These remain in that
<span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> till the results of their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> deeds are over, and
assume then a new body, according to their work, like
caterpillars. With them there is also a <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> of
these states, and the acts which caused them to
assume this or that body, leave impressions behind, like
dreams. This is not the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> with those who in
their descent from the moon, pass, as we saw, through
an <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> as rice, corn, &c. They have no
<span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> of such existences, at least not in their
descent. In their ascent to the moon, they have
consciousness, as a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> who climbs up a tree knows

For, verily, that is real respect which is shown to

1, 3-1:3. As he begins with the sound Him, surely that
masculine sound of Him and the feminine Rik (the

1, 3-1:5. He who knows this digs up, by means of the

be said to consist of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> divisions, or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> Upanishads.
Their general title is Bahvrika-upanishad,
sometimes Mahaitareya-upanishad, while the Upanishad
generally known as Aitareya-upanishad
comprises the 4th, 5th, and 6th adhyayas only of the
<span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> Aranyaka.
The character of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> component portions of the

consists of those who have turned away from the world,

the Ait. Ar. II, 4-6. The middle class are those who wish
to become <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> gradually by attaining to the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> of Hiranyagarbha. For them the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> and
worship of Prana (breath and life) is intended, as
explained in the Ait. Ar. II, 1-3. The lowest class consists
of those who do not care either for immediate
or gradual freedom, but who <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> nothing but offspring,
cattle, &c. For these the meditative worship of
the Samhita is intended, as explained in the <span class="t7 hoverable">third</span>
Aranyaka. They cling too strongly to the letter of the
sacred <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> to be able to surrender it for a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span>
either of Prana (life) or of Brahman.'
The connexion between the Upanishad or rather the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span>
Upanishads and the first Aranyaka seems at
first sight very slight. Still we soon perceive that it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span>
be impossible to understand the first
Upanishad, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> a previous <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of the
Mahavrata ceremony as described in the first Aranyaka.
On this point too there are some pertinent remarks in
Sankara's commentary on the Aranyaka II, 1, 2.
`Our first duty,' he says, `consists in performing sacrifices,
such as are described in the first portion of the
Veda, the Samhitas, Brahmanas, and, to a certain extent,
in the Aranyakas also. Afterwards arises a
217

desire for knowledge, which cannot be satisfied except a
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> has first attained complete concentration of

the performance of certain upasanas or
meditations is enjoined, such as we <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> described in our
Upanishad, viz. in Ar. II, 1-3.'
This <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> or, as it is sometimes translated, worship
is of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> kinds, either brahmopasana or

certain qualities. Pratikopasana or <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on symbols
consists in looking <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> certain worldly objects
as if they were Brahman, in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> to withdraw the

objects.
These objects, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> lifted up into symbols of Brahman,
are of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> kinds, either connected with <span class="t2 t9 t10 t16 t18 t19 t27 t28 hoverable">sacrifice</span> or
not. In our Upanishad we have to deal with the former
class only, viz. with certain portions of the
Mahavrata, as described in the first Aranyaka. In <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span>
that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> may not be entirely absorbed by the
sacrifice, it is lifted up during the performance from the
consideration of these sacrificial objects to a
<span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> objects, leading up at last to
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> as prana or life.
This <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> is to be performed by the priests, and
while they meditate they may meditate on a <span class="t4 hoverable">hymn</span> or
on a single <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> of it as <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> something else, such as
the sun, the earth, or the sky, but not vice versa.
And if in one Sakha, as in that of the Aitareyins, for
instance, a certain <span class="t4 hoverable">hymn</span> has been symbolically
explained, the same explanation may be adopted by
another Sakha also, such as that of the Kaushitakins.
It is not necessary, however, that every part of the
<span class="t2 t9 t10 t16 t18 t19 t27 t28 hoverable">sacrifice</span> should be accompanied by meditation, but it is
<span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> optional to the priest in what particular <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> he
wishes to engage, nor is even the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of the
<span class="t2 t9 t10 t16 t18 t19 t27 t28 hoverable">sacrifice</span> the only right <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> for him to engage in these
meditations.
2, 1-1:1. This is the path: this sacrifice, and this
Brahman. This is the true.

2, 1-1:3. For the old (sages) did not transgress it, and
those who did transgress, became lost.
2, 1-1:4. This has been declared by a Rishi (Rv. VIII,
101, 14): `Three (classes of) <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> transgressed,

about the venerable,' he means those who now sit
down to worship <span class="t4 t6 t9 t10 t12 t14 t17 t18 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">Agni</span> (fire).

Pragapati are the Devas (gods). The seed of the
Devas is rain. The seed of rain are herbs. The seed of
herbs is food. The seed of <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> is seed. The seed
of seed are creatures. The seed of creatures is the heart.
The seed of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> is the mind. The seed of

(sacrifice). The action done (in a former state) is
this man, the abode of Brahman.
2, 1-3:2. He (man) consists of <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> (ira), and because he
consists of <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> (iramaya), he consists of gold
(hiranmaya). He who knows this becomes golden in the
other world, and is seen as golden (as the sun) for
the benefit of all beings.

2, 1-4:5. The Sarkarakshyas meditate on the belly as

2, 1-5:1. Then the Devas carried him (the breath) forth,

then it was in the evening. Day, therefore, is the

2, 1-5:5. That breath is (to be called) sattya (the true), for
sat is breath, ti is food, yam is the sun. This is

(cause), that (the world) was the shoot (effect). He (the
person) is the father, they (earth, fire, &c.) are the
sons. Whatever there is belonging to the son, belongs to
the father; whatever there is belonging to the
father, belongs to the son. This was intended.
2, 1-8:2. Mahidasa Aitareya, who knew this, said: `I know
myself (reaching) as far as the gods, and I
know the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> (reaching) as far as me.

2, 1-8:5. He (the Prana, identified with Brahman) is the
life, the breath; he is being (while the givatman
remains), and not-being (when the givatman departs).
2, 1-8:6. The Devas (speech, &c.) worshipped him
(prana) as Bhuti or being, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> they became <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>

immortality (while he abides).
2, 1-8:10. And this has been said by a Rishi (Rv. I, 164,
38):
2, 1-8:11. `Downwards and upwards he (the wind of the
breath) goes, held by food;' for this upbreathing, being held back by the down-breathing, does
not move forward (and leave the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> altogether).
2, 1-8:12. `The immortal dwells with the mortal;'- for
through him (the breath) all this dwells together,
the bodies being clearly mortal, but this being (the
breath), being immortal.
2, 1-8:13. `These <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> (body and breath) go for ever in

one (the body), but they do not increase the other,'
i.e. they increase these bodies (by food), but this being

2, 1-8:14. He who knows this becomes immortal in that

2, 3-2:5. With regard to the other animals hunger and
thirst only are a kind of understanding. But they
do not say what they have known, nor do they see what
they have known. They do not know what is to
happen to-morrow, nor <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heaven</span> and hell. They go so far
and no further, for they are <span class="t16 t24 hoverable">born</span> according to
their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> (in a former life).

he wishes to go beyond. If he reaches the sky, he wishes
to go beyond.
2, 3-3:2. If he should reach that (heavenly) world, he
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> wish to go beyond.
2, 3-3:3. That <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> is fivefold. The heat in him is fire; the
apertures (of the senses) are ether; blood,
mucus, and seed are water; the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> is earth; breath is
air.
2, 3-3:4. That air is fivefold, viz. up-breathing, downbreathing, back-breathing, out-breathing, onbreathing. The other powers (devatas), viz. sight,
hearing, mind, and speech, are comprised under upbreathing and down-breathing. For when breath departs,
they also depart with it.
2, 3-3:5. That <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> (conceived as uktha) is the sacrifice,
which is a succession now of speech and now of
thought. That <span class="t2 t9 t10 t16 t18 t19 t27 t28 hoverable">sacrifice</span> is fivefold, viz. the Agnihotra, the
new and <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span> moon sacrifices, the four-monthly
sacrifices, the animal sacrifice, the Soma sacrifice. The
Soma <span class="t2 t9 t10 t16 t18 t19 t27 t28 hoverable">sacrifice</span> is the most perfect of sacrifices,
for in it these five kinds of ceremonies are seen: the first
which precedes the libations (the Diksha, &c.),
then <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> libations, and what follows (the Avabhritha,
&c.) is the fifth.

2, 3-4:2. This uktha is fivefold. With regard to its being
performed as a Stoma (chorus), it is Trivrit,
235

Pankadasa, Saptadasa, Ekavimsa, and Pankavimsa.
With regard to its being performed as a Saman
(song), it is Gayatra, Rathantara, Brihat, Bhadra, and
Ragana. With regard to metre, it is Gayatri,
Ushnih, Brihati, Trishtubh, and Dvipada. And the
explanation (given before in the Aranyaka) is that it is
the head, the right wing, the <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> wing, the tail, and the

2, 3-4:3. He performs the Prastava in five ways, he
performs the Udgitha in five ways, he performs the
Pratihara in five ways, he performs the Upadrava in five
ways, he performs the Nidhana in five ways. All
this <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> forms one <span class="t15 t23 hoverable">thousand</span> Stobhas, or musical
syllables.
2, 3-4:4. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> also are the Rik verses, contained in the
Nishkevalya, recited (by the Hotri) in five orders.
What precedes the eighty trikas, that is one order, then
follow the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> sets of eighty trikas each, and
what comes after is the fifth order.
2, 3-4:5. This (the hymns of this Sastra) as a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> (if
properly counted with the Stobha syllables) comes
to one <span class="t15 t23 hoverable">thousand</span> (of Brihati verses). That (thousand) is
the whole, and ten, ten is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the whole. For
<span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> is such (measured by ten). Ten tens are a
hundred, ten hundreds are a thousand, and that is the
whole. These are the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> metres (the tens, pervading

Section 5
Fifth Khanda
2, 3-5:1. This (nishkevalya-sastra) becomes perfect as a
<span class="t15 t23 hoverable">thousand</span> of Brihati verses.
2, 3-5:2. Some teachers (belonging to a different Sakha)
recognise a <span class="t15 t23 hoverable">thousand</span> of different metres (not of
Brihatis only). They say: `Is another <span class="t15 t23 hoverable">thousand</span> (a
<span class="t15 t23 hoverable">thousand</span> of other verses) good? Let us say it is good.'
236

2, 3-5:3. Some say, a <span class="t15 t23 hoverable">thousand</span> of Trishtubh verses,
others a <span class="t15 t23 hoverable">thousand</span> of Gagati verses, others a <span class="t15 t23 hoverable">thousand</span>
of Anushtubh verses.
2, 3-5:4. This has been said by a Rishi (Rv. X, 124, 9):
2, 3-5:5. `Poets through their understanding discovered
Indra dancing an Anushtubh.' This is meant to
say: They discovered (and meditated) in speech (called
Anushtubh) at that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> (when they worshipped
the uktha)- the Prana (breath) connected with Indra.
2, 3-5:6. He (who takes the recited verses as
Anushtubhs) is able to become celebrated and of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span>

2, 3-5:7. No! he says; rather is such a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> liable to die
before his time. For that self (consisting of
Anushtubhs) is incomplete. For if a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> confines himself
to speech, not to breath, then driven by his
mind, he does not succeed with speech.
2, 3-5:8. Let him <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> towards the Brihati, for the Brihati
(breath) is the complete self.
2, 3-5:9. That self (givatman) is surrounded on all sides
by members. And as that self is on all sides
surrounded by members, the Brihati also is on all sides
surrounded by metres.
2, 3-5:10. For the self (in the heart) is the middle of these
members, and the Brihati is the middle of the
metres.
2, 3-5:11. `He is able to become celebrated and of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span>

reckon the sastra recitation as a <span class="t15 t23 hoverable">thousand</span> Brihatis).

2, 3-6:1. This (nishkevalya-sastra) becomes perfect as a
<span class="t15 t23 hoverable">thousand</span> of Brihati verses. In this <span class="t15 t23 hoverable">thousand</span> of
Brihatis there are one <span class="t15 t23 hoverable">thousand</span> one hundred and twentyfive Anushtubhs. For the smaller is contained in
the larger.
2, 3-6:2. This has been said by a Rishi (Rv. VIII, 76, 12):
2, 3-6:3. `A speech of eight feet;' because there are
eight feet of four syllables each in the Anushtubh.
2, 3-6:4. `Of nine corners;' because the Brihati becomes
nine-cornered (having nine feet of four
syllables each).
2, 3-6:5. `Touching the truth;' because speech
(Anushtubh) is truth, touched by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">verse</span> (Brihati).
2, 3-6:6. `He (the Hotri) makes the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> out of Indra;'
for out of this <span class="t15 t23 hoverable">thousand</span> of Brihati verses turned
into Anushtubhs, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> out of Prana as connected
with Indra, and out of the Brihati (which is
Prana), he makes speech, that is Anushtubh, as a body.
2, 3-6:7. This Mahaduktha is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> development of
speech, and it is fivefold, viz. measured, not
measured, music, true, and untrue.
2, 3-6:8. A Rik verse, a gatha, a kumbya are measured
(metrical). A Yagus line, an invocation, and
general remarks, these are not measured (they are in
prose). A Saman, or any portion (parvan) of it, is
music. Om is true, Na is untrue.
2, 3-6:9. What is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> (Om) is the flower and fruit of
speech. He is able to become celebrated and of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span>

speech.
2, 3-6:10. Now the untrue is the root of speech, and as a
tree <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> root is exposed dries up and perishes,

what is untrue, but guard oneself from it.

2, 3-6:11. That syllable Om (yes) goes forward (to the
first cause of the world) and is empty. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Therefore</span> if

Section 1
First Khanda
With this adhyaya begins the real Upanishad, best known
under the name of the Aitareya-upanishad, and
often separately edited, commented on, and translated. If
treated separately, what we <span class="t3 t11 t18 t27 hoverable">call</span> the fourth
adhyaya of the <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> Aranyaka, becomes the first
adhyaya of the Upanishad, sometimes also, by counting
all adhyayas from the beginning of the Aitareya-aranyaka,
the ninth. The divisions adopted by Sayana,
who explains the Upanishad as part of the Aranyaka, and
by Sankara, who explains it independently,
vary, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> Sayana states that he follows in his
commentary on the Upanishad the earlier commentary of
Sankara. I have given the divisions adopted by Sayana,
and have marked those of Sankara's by figures in
parentheses, placed at the end of each paragraph. The
difference between this Upanishad and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span>
preceding adhyayas is easily perceived. Hitherto the
answer to the question, Whence this world? had
been, From Prana, prana <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> breath and life, which

This, however, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> it may have satisfied the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> of
the Brahmans for a time, was not a final solution.
That final solution of the problem not simply of life, but of
existence, is given in the Upanishad which
teaches that Atman, the Self, and not Prana, Life, is the
last and only cause of everything. In some places
this doctrine is laid down in all its simplicity. Our <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> self,

mixed up with much that is mythological, fanciful, and
absurd, arthavada, as the commentators <span class="t3 t11 t18 t27 hoverable">call</span> it, but
as it might often be more truly called, anarthavada, and it
is only towards the end that the identity of the

Nostrils burst forth. From the nostrils proceeded scent

2, 5-1:1. Let the women who are with child move away!
2, 5-1:2. Verily, from the beginning he (the self) is in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span>

2, 5-1:3. This (seed), which is strength gathered from all
the limbs of the body, he (the man) bears as self
in his self (body). When he commits the seed to the
woman, then he (the father) causes it to be born.
That is his first birth. (1)
2, 5-1:4. That seed becomes the self of the woman, as if
one of her own limbs. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Therefore</span> it does not
injure her.
2, 5-1:5. She nourishes his (her husband's) self (the son)

nourished.
2, 5-1:6. The woman bears the germ. He (the father)
elevates the child even before the birth, and
immediately after.
2, 5-1:7. When he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> elevates the child both before
and after his birth, he really elevates his own self,
247

2, 5-1:8. For the continuation of these worlds (men). For

2, 5-1:9. This is his <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> birth. (3)
2, 5-1:10. He (the son), being his self, is then placed in
his stead for (the performance of) all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> works.
2, 5-1:11. But his other self (the father), having done all
he has to do, and having reached the <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span>
measure of his life, departs.
2, 5-1:12. And departing from hence he is <span class="t16 t24 hoverable">born</span> again.
That is his <span class="t7 hoverable">third</span> birth.
2, 5-1:13. And this has been declared by a Rishi (Rv. IV,
27, 1): (4)
2, 5-1:14. `While dwelling in the womb, I discovered all
the births of these Devas. A hundred iron
strongholds kept me, but I escaped quickly down like a
falcon.'
2, 5-1:15. Vamadeva, lying in the womb, has <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span>
declared this. (5)
And having this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> he stepped forth, after this

3, 1-2:9. He who <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> knows this union, becomes united
with offspring, cattle, fame, <span class="t0 t7 t21 t27 hoverable">glory</span> of
countenance, and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> of Svarga. He lives his <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span>
age.
Section 3
<span class="t7 hoverable">Third</span> Khanda
3, 1-3:1. Next come the reciters of the Nirbhuga.
3, 1-3:2. Nirbhuga abides on earth, Pratrinna in heaven,
the Ubhayamantarena in the sky.
3, 1-3:3. Now, if any one should chide him who recites
the Nirbhuga, let him answer: `Thou <span class="t2 t6 t8 t9 t10 t15 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">art</span> fallen
from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> lower places.' If any one should chide him
who recites the Pratrinna, let him answer: `Thou

But he who recites
the Ubhayamantarena, there is no chiding him.
3, 1-3:4. For when he turns out the Sandhi (the union of
words), that is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of Nirbhuga; and when
he pronounces <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> syllables pure (without modification),
that is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of Pratrinna. This comes first.
By the Ubhayamantara (what is between the two) both
are fulfilled (both the sandhi and the pada).
3, 1-3:5. Let him who wishes for proper <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> say the
Nirbhuga; let him who wishes for Svarga, say the
Pratrinna; let him who wishes for both say the
Ubhayamantarena.
252

3, 1-3:6. Now if another <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> (an enemy) should chide
him who says the Nirbhuga, let him say to him:
`Thou <span class="t0 t6 t12 t13 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">hast</span> offended the earth, the deity; the earth, the

If another <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> should chide him who says the Pratrinna,
let him say to him: `Thou <span class="t0 t6 t12 t13 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">hast</span> offended heaven,
the deity; heaven, the deity, will strike thee.'
If another <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> should chide him who says the
Ubhayamantarena, let him say to him: `Thou <span class="t0 t6 t12 t13 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">hast</span>

the sky, the deity; the sky, the deity, will strike thee.'
3, 1-3:7. And whatever the reciter shall say to one who
speaks to him or does not <span class="t9 t11 t20 t21 t22 t23 t27 hoverable">speak</span> to him, depend

3, 1-3:8. But to a Brahmana let him not say anything
except what is auspicious.
3, 1-3:9. Only he may curse a Brahmana in excessive
wealth.
3, 1-3:10. Nay, not even in excessive wealth should he
curse a Brahmana, but he should say, `I bow
before Brahmanas,' <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> says Suravira Mandukeya.
Section 4
Fourth Khanda
3, 1-4:1. Next follow the imprecations.
3, 1-4:2. Let him know that breath is the beam (on which
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> rests).
3, 1-4:3. If any one (a Brahmana or another man) should
chide him, who by <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> has become that
breath as beam, then, if he thinks himself strong, he says:
`I grasped the breath, the beam, well; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thou</span> dost
not prevail against me who have grasped the breath as
the beam.' Let him say to him: `Breath, the beam,
will forsake thee.'
253

3, 1-4:4. But if he thinks himself not strong, let him say to
him: `Thou couldst not grasp him who wishes
to grasp the breath as the beam. Breath, the beam, will
forsake thee.'
3, 1-4:5. And whatever the reciter shall say to one who
speaks to him or does not <span class="t9 t11 t20 t21 t22 t23 t27 hoverable">speak</span> to him, depend
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> it, it will come to pass. But to a Brahmana let him
not say anything except what is auspicious. Only
he may curse a Brahmana in excessive wealth. Nay, not
even in excessive wealth should he curse a
Brahmana, but he should say, `I bow before Brahmanas,'

Section 5
Fifth Khanda
3, 1-5:1. Now those who repeat the Nirbhuga say:
3, 1-5:2. `The former half is the first syllable, the latter half
the <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> syllable, and the space between the
first and <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> halves is the Samhita (union).'
3, 1-5:3. He who <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> knows this Samhita (union),
becomes united with offspring, cattle, fame, <span class="t0 t7 t21 t27 hoverable">glory</span> of
countenance, and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> of Svarga. He lives his <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span>
age.
3, 1-5:4. Now Hrasva Mandukeya says: `We reciters of
Nirbhuga say, "Yes, the former half is the first
syllable, and the latter half the <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> syllable, but the
Samhita is the space between the first and <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span>
halves in so far as by it one turns out the union (sandhi),
and knows what is the accent and what is not,
and distinguishes what is the mora and what is not."'
3, 1-5:5. He who <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> knows this Samhita (union),
becomes united with offspring, cattle, fame, <span class="t0 t7 t21 t27 hoverable">glory</span> of
countenance, and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> of Svarga. He lives his <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span>
age.
3, 1-5:6. Now his middle son, the child of his mother
Pratibodhi, says: `One pronounces these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span>
syllables letter by letter, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> entirely separating them,
and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> entirely uniting them. Then that

mora between the first and <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> halves, which
indicates the union, that is the Saman (evenness,
sliding). I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> hold Saman only to be the Samhita
(union).
3, 1-5:7. This has also been declared by a Rishi (Rv. II,
23, 16):
3, 1-5:8. `O Brihaspati, they know nothing <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> than
Saman.'
3, 1-5:9. He who <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> knows this Samhita (union),
becomes united with offspring, cattle, fame, <span class="t0 t7 t21 t27 hoverable">glory</span> of
countenance, and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> of Svarga. He lives his <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span>
age.
Section 6
Sixth Khanda
3, 1-6:1. Tarukshya said: `The Samhita (union) is formed
by means of the Brihat and Rathantara Samans.'
3, 1-6:2. Verily, the Rathantara Saman is speech, the
Brihat Saman is breath. By both, by speech and
breath, the Samhita is formed.
3, 1-6:3. For this Upanishad (for acquiring from his
teacher the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of this Samhita of speech and
breath) Tarukshya guards (his teacher's) cows a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span>
year.
3, 1-6:4. For it alone Tarukshya guards the cows a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span>
year.
3, 1-6:5. This has also been declared by a Rishi (Rv. X,
181, 1; and Rv. X, 181, 2):
3, 1-6:6. `Vasishtha carried hither the Rathantara;
`Bharadvaga <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> hither the Brihat of Agni.'
3, 1-6:7. He who <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> knows this Samhita (union),
becomes united with offspring, cattle, fame, <span class="t0 t7 t21 t27 hoverable">glory</span> of
countenance, and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> of Svarga. He lives his <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span>
age.
255

3, 1-6:8. Kauntharavya said: `Speech is united with
breath, breath with the blowing air, the blowing air
with the Visvedevas, the Visvedevas with the heavenly
world, the heavenly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> with Brahman. That
Samhita is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the gradual Samhita.'
3, 1-6:9. He who knows this gradual Samhita (union),
becomes united with offspring, cattle, fame, <span class="t0 t7 t21 t27 hoverable">glory</span>
of countenance, and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> of Svarga, in exactly the
same manner as this Samhita, i.e. gradually.
3, 1-6:10. If that worshipper, <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> for his own sake or
for that of another, recites (the Samhita), let
him know when he is going to recite, that this Samhita

those who by knowing it become Devas. May it always
be so!
3, 1-6:11. He who <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> knows this Samhita (union),
becomes united with offspring, cattle, fame, <span class="t0 t7 t21 t27 hoverable">glory</span> of
countenance, and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> of Svarga. He lives his <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span>
age.
3, 1-6:12. Pankalakanda said: `The Samhita (union,
composition) is speech.'
3, 1-6:13. Verily, by speech the Vedas, by speech the
metres are composed. Friends unite through
speech, all <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> unite through speech; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span>
speech is everything here.
3, 1-6:14. With regard to this (view of speech being more
than breath), it should be borne in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> that
when we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> repeat (the Veda) or speak, breath is
(absorbed) in speech; speech swallows breath. And
when we are silent or sleep, speech is (absorbed) in
breath; breath swallows speech. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> swallow
each other. Verily, speech is the mother, breath the son.
3, 1-6:15. This has been declared also by a Rishi (Rv. X,
114, 4):
3, 1-6:16. `There is one bird; (as wind) he has entered
the sky; (as breath or living soul) he saw this
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> world. With my ripe <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> I saw him close to me (in
the heart); the mother (licks or) absorbs him
256

(breath), and he absorbs the mother (speech).'
3, 1-6:17. He who <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> knows this Samhita (union),
becomes united with offspring, cattle, fame, <span class="t0 t7 t21 t27 hoverable">glory</span> of
countenance, and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> of Svarga. He lives his <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span>
age.
3, 1-6:18. Next follows the Pragapati-Samhita.
3, 1-6:19. The former half is the wife, the latter half the
man; the result of their union the son; the act of
their union the begetting; that Samhita is Aditi
(indestructible).
3, 1-6:20. For Aditi (indestructible) is all this whatever
there is, father, mother, son, and begetting.
3, 1-6:21. This has also been declared by a Rishi (Rv. I,
189, 10):
3, 1-6:22. `Aditi is mother, is father, is son.'

3, 2-1:1. Sthavira Sakalya said that breath is the beam,
and as the other beams rest on the house-beam,

3, 2-1:2. Of that self the breathing is like the sibilants, the
bones like the mutes, the marrow like the
vowels, and the fourth part, flesh, blood, and the rest, like
the semivowels, so said Hrasva Mandukeya.
257

3, 2-1:3. To us it was said to be a triad only.
3, 2-1:4. Of that triad, viz. bones, marrow, and joints,
there are 360 (parts) on this <span class="t6 hoverable">side</span> (the right), and
360 on that <span class="t6 hoverable">side</span> (the left). They make 720 together, and

(consonants), 360 groups.
3, 2-2:3. What we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> syllables are the days, what we

3, 2-2:4. Now with regard to the body. The syllables
which we explained mythologically, are
physiologically the bones; the sibilants which we
explained mythologically, are physiologically the
marrow.
3, 2-2:5. Marrow is the real breath (life), for marrow is
seed, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> breath (life) seed is not sown.

not grow.
3, 2-2:6. The groups which we explained mythologically,
are physiologically the joints.

there are 540 (parts) on this <span class="t6 hoverable">side</span> (the right), and

540 on that <span class="t6 hoverable">side</span> (the left). They make 1080 together, and

raven's nest: let him know then that his self
(in the body) is gone, and that he will not live very long.
3, 2-4:8. Then whatever he thinks he has to do, let him
do it, and let him recite the following hymns: Yad
anti yak ka durake (Rv. IX, 67, 21-27); Ad it pratnasya
retasah (Rv. VIII, 6, 30); Yatra brahma pavamana

3, 2-4:11. Next, let him cover his <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> and watch, then
threads are seen as if falling together. But if he
does not see them, let him know then that it is so.
3, 2-4:12. Next, let him cover his ears and listen, and
there will be a sound as if of a burning <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> or of a

3, 2-4:15. These are the visible signs (from 7-14).

this they <span class="t3 t11 t18 t27 hoverable">call</span> so (chiefly).

3, 2-5:2. The mute consonants represent the earth, the
sibilants the sky, the vowels heaven.
The mute consonants represent <span class="t4 t6 t9 t10 t12 t14 t17 t18 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">Agni</span> (fire), the sibilants

The mute consonants represent the Rig-veda, the

The mute consonants represent the eye, the sibilants the
ear, the vowels the mind.
The mute consonants represent the up-breathing, the
sibilants the down-breathing, the vowels the backbreathing.
3, 2-5:3. Next comes this <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> lute (the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> body,

imitation of it.
3, 2-5:4. As there is a <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> of this, so there is a <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> of
that (lute, made by man). As there is a stomach
of this, so there is the cavity (in the board) of that. As
there is a tongue of this, so there is a tongue in
that. As there are fingers of this, so there are strings of
that. As there are vowels of this, so there are
tones of that. As there are consonants of this, so there
are touches of that. As this is endowed with sound
and firmly strung, so that is endowed with sound and
firmly strung. As this is covered with a hairy skin,
so that is covered with a hairy skin.
3, 2-5:5. Verily, in former times they covered a lute with a
hairy skin.
3, 2-5:6. He who knows this lute made by the Devas (and
meditates on it), is willingly listened to, his
<span class="t0 t7 t21 t27 hoverable">glory</span> fills the earth, and wherever they <span class="t9 t11 t20 t21 t22 t23 t27 hoverable">speak</span> Aryan
languages, there they know him.
3, 2-5:7. Next follows the verse, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> vagrasa, the
essence of speech. When a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> reciting or speaking

3, 2-5:8. `May the queen of all speech, who is covered,
as it were, by the lips, surrounded by teeth, as if by
spears, who is a thunderbolt, help me to <span class="t9 t11 t20 t21 t22 t23 t27 hoverable">speak</span> well.' This
is the vagrasa, the essence of speech.
Section 6
Sixth Khanda
3, 2-6:1. Next Krishna-Harita confided this Brahmana
concerning speech to him (his pupil):
3, 2-6:2. Pragapati, the year, after having sent forth all
creatures, burst. He put himself <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> again by
means of khandas (Vedas). Because he put himself
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> again by means of khandas, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> (the

3, 2-6:3. Of that Samhita the letter n is the strength, the
letter sh the breath and self (atman).
3, 2-6:4. He who knows the Rik verses and the letters n
and sh for every Samhita, he knows the Samhita
with strength and breath. Let him know that this is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span>
of the Samhita.
3, 2-6:5. If the pupil asks, `Shall I say it with the letter n or
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> it?' let the teacher say, `With the
letter n' And if he asks, `Shall I say it with the letter sh or
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> it?' let the teacher say, `With the letter
sh.'
3, 2-6:6. Hrasva Mandukeya said: `If we here recite the
verses according to the Samhita (attending to the
necessary changes of n and s into n and sh), and if we
say the adhyaya of Mandukeya (Ait. Ar. III, 1),
then the letters n and sh (strength and breath) have by
this been obtained for us.'
3, 2-6:7. Sthavira Sakalya said: `If we recite the verses
according to the Samhita, and if we say the
adhyaya of Mandukeya, then the letters n and sh have by
this been obtained for us.'
3, 2-6:8. Here the Rishis, the Kavasheyas, knowing this,
said: `Why should we repeat (the Veda), why
264

should we sacrifice? We offer as a <span class="t2 t9 t10 t16 t18 t19 t27 t28 hoverable">sacrifice</span> breath in
speech, or speech in breath. What is the beginning
(of one), that is the end (of the other).'
3, 2-6:9. Let no one tell these Samhitas (Ait. Ar. III, 1-2)
to one who is not a resident pupil, who has not
been with his teacher at least one year, and who is not
himself to become an instructor. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> say the
teachers, yea, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> say the teachers.
2, 3-4:2. Note: All these are technicalities connected with
the singing and reciting of the uktha. The
commentator says: The stoma is a collection of single
Rik verses occurring in the trikas which have to be
sung. The Trivrit stoma, as explained in the Samabrahmana, is as follows: There are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> Suktas, each

S. V. Uttararkika I, 1, 1 = Rv. IX, 11. The
Udgatri first sings the first <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> verses in each hymn.
This is the first round. He then sings the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span>
middle verses in each hymn. This is the <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> round.
He lastly sings the last <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> verses in each hymn.
This is the <span class="t7 hoverable">third</span> round. This song is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Udyati.
The Pankadasa stoma is formed out of one Sukta only,

The Saptadasa stoma is formed in the same manner,

Sayana in his commentary on the Ait. Ar. takes the Trivrit
stoma to be formed out of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> hymns, each

stomas are formed out of one <span class="t4 hoverable">hymn</span> only. B. and
R., s. v. trivrit, <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> that this stoma consists of verses 1,
4, 7; 2, 5, 8; and 3, 6, 9 of the Rig-veda <span class="t4 hoverable">hymn</span> IX,
11, but, accoording to Sayana, the stoma consists (1) of
the first verses of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> Suktas, ukpasmai

Mahidhara (Yv. X, 9) takes the same view, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> the

Tandya-brahmana seems to support the opinion of B. and

The five Samans are explained by the commentator. The
Gayatra is formed out of the Rik (III, 62, 10) tat
savitur varenyam. The Rathantara is formed out of the
Rik (VII, 32, 22) abhi tva sura nonuma. The
Brihat is formed out of the Rik (VI, 46, 1) tvam id dhi
havamahe. The Bhadra is formed out of the Rik
(X, 157, 1) ima nu kam. The Ragana is formed out of the
Rik (VII, 27, 1) indram naro nemadhita.
The metres require no explanation.
In identifying certain portions of the Nishkevalya <span class="t4 hoverable">hymn</span>

this was explained in the first Aranyaka.
3, 2-6:9. Note: The strict prohibition uttered at the end
of the <span class="t7 hoverable">third</span> Aranyaka, not to divulge a

here explained, is peculiar. It <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have
seemed self-evident that, like the rest of the sruti or
sacred literature, the Aranyaka too, and evey portion
of it, could have been learnt from the mouth of a teacher
only, and according to rule (niyamena), i.e. by a
pupil performing all the duties of a student (brahmakarin),
so that no one except a regular pupil
(antevasin) could possibly gain access to it. Nor can
there be any doubt that we ought to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span>
asamvatsaravasin and apravaktri as limitations, and to
translate, `Let no one tell these Samhitas to any
pupil who has not at least been a year with his master,
and who does not mean to become a teacher in
turn.'
That this is the right <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> is confirmed by similar
injunctions given at the end of the fifth Aranyaka. Here
we have first some rules as to who is qualified to recite
the Mahavrata. No one is permitted to do so, who
has not passed throught the Diksha, the initiation for the
Agnishtoma. If the Mahavrata is performed as a
Sattra, the sacrificer is a Hotri priest, and he naturally has
passed through tha ceremony. But if the
Mahavrata is performed as an Ekaha or Ahina ceremony,
anybody might be the sacrificer, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> it
was necessary to say that no one who is adikshita,
uninitiated, should recite it for another person; not
should he do so, when the Mahavrata is performed
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> (or with) an altar, or if it does not last one
year. In saying, however, that one should not recite the
Mahavrata for another person, parents and
teachers are not to be understood as included, because
what is done for them, is done for ouselves.
After these restrictions as to the recitation of the
Mahavrata, follow other restrictions as to the teaching of
it, and here we read, as at the end of the Upanishad:
267

4. `Let no one teach this day, the Mahavrata, to one who
is not a regular pupil (antevasin), and has been
so for one year, certainly not to one who has not been so
for one year; not to one who is not a brahmakarin
and does not study the same Veda, certainly not to one
who does not study the same Veda; nor to one who
does not come to him.
5. `Let the teaching not be more than saying it once or
twice, twice only.
6. `One <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> should tell it to one man, so says
Gatukarnya.
7. `Not to a child, nor to a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> in his <span class="t7 hoverable">third</span> stage of life.
8. `The teacher and pupil should not stand, nor walk, nor
lie down, nor sit on a couch; but they should
both sit on the ground.
9. `The pupil should not lean backward while learning,
nor lean forward. He should not be covered with
too much clothing, nor assume the postures of a devotee,
but <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> using any of the apparel of a devotee,
simply elevate his knees. Nor should he learn, when he
has eaten flesh, when he has seen blood, or a
corpse, or when he has done an unlawful thing; when he
has anointed his eyes, oiled or rubbed his body,
when he has been shaved or bathed, put colour on, or
ornamented himself with flower-wreaths, when he
has been writing or effacing his writing.
10. `Nor should he finish the reading in one day, so says
Gatukarnya, while according to Galava, he
should finish it in one day. Agnivesyayana holds that he
should finish all before the Trikasitis, and then
rest in another <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> finishing it.
11. `And in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> where he reads this, he should not
read anything else, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> he may read this (the
Mdahavrata) where he has read something else.
12. `No one should bathe and become a snataka who
does not read this. Even if he has read many other
268

things, he should not become a snataka if he has not
read this.
13. `Nor should he forget it, and even if he should forget
anything else, he should not forget this.
14. `No, he should never forget this.
15. `If he does not forget this, it will be enough for himself
(or for acquiring a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of the Self).
16. `It is enough, let him know this to be true.
17. `Let him who knows this not communicate, nor dine,
nor amuse himself with any one who does not
know it.'
Then follow some more rules as to the reading of the
Veda in general:
18. `When the old <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> that stood round the roots of
trees is dried up (after about the month of Pausha,
January to February) he should not read; nor (at any
time) in the morning or in the afternoon, when the
shadows meet (he should begin at sunrise so soon as the
shadows divide, and end in the evening before
they fall together). Nor should he read when a cloud has
risen; and when there is an unseasonable rain
(after the months of Sravana and Bhadrapada, August
and September) he should stop his Vedic reading
for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> nights. Nor should he at that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> tell stories,
not even during the night, nor should he <span class="t0 t7 t21 t27 hoverable">glory</span> in
his knowledge.
19. `This (the Veda <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> learnt and studied) is the name
of that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Great</span> Being; and he who <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> knows the

First Adhyaya
1:1. Kitra Gangyayani, forsooth, wishing to perform a
sacrifice, chose Aruni (Uddalaka, to be his chief
priest). But Aruni sent his son, Svetaketu, and said:
`Perform the <span class="t2 t9 t10 t16 t18 t19 t27 t28 hoverable">sacrifice</span> for him.' When Svetaketu had
arrived, Kitra asked him: `Son of Gautama, is there a

leads?'
He answered and said: `I do not know this. But, let me
ask the master.' Having approached his father, he
asked `Thus has Kitra asked me; how shall I answer?'
Aruni said: `I also do not know this. Only after having
learnt the proper portion of the Veda in Kitra's
own dwelling, shall we obtain what others give us
(knowledge). Come, we will both go.'
Having said this he <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> fuel in his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> (like a pupil), and
approached Kitra Gangyayani, saying: `May I
come near to you?' He replied: `You are worthy of
Brahman, O Gautama, because you were not led away
by pride. Come hither, I shall make you know clearly.'
1:2. And Kitra said: All who depart from this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> (or this

thou?' And he should answer: `From the <span class="t8 t12 t17 hoverable">wise</span>

of fifteen parts, from the moon who is the home

begs not, but the charitable will press him and say, `Let

2:2. Prana (breath) is Brahman, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> says Paingya. And
in that prana, which is Brahman, the eye stands
firm behind speech, the ear stands firm behind the eye,
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> stands firm behind the ear, and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span>

stands firm behind the mind. To that prana, which is
Brahman, all these deities <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> an offering, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span>

2:3. Now follows the attainment of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> treasure
(scil. prana, spirit). If a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> meditates on that

in the bright fortnight, under an auspicious
Nakshatra, at one of these proper times, bending his right
knee, offer oblations of ghee with a ladle
(sruva), after having placed the fire, swept the ground,
strewn the sacred grass, and sprinkled water. Let
him say: `The deity <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Speech is the attainer, may it

Then having inhaled the smell of the smoke, and having
rubbed his limbs with the ointment of ghee,
walking on in silence, let him declare his wish, or let him
send a messenger. He will surely obtain his
wish.
275

2:4. Now follows the Daiva Smara, the <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> to be
accomplished by the gods. If a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> desires to become

then at one of the (fore-mentioned) proper times he
offers, in exactly the same manner (as before), oblations
of ghee, saying: `I offer <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thy</span> speech in myself, I

myself, I (this one here), Svaha.' Then having
inhaled the smell of the smoke, and having rubbed his
limbs with the ointment of ghee, walking on in
silence, let him try to come in contact or let him stand
speaking in the wind, (so that the wind may carry
his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> to the <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> by whom he desires to be loved).
Surely he becomes dear, and they think of him.
2:5. Now follows the restraint (samyamana) instituted by
Pratardana (the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> of Divodasa): they <span class="t3 t11 t18 t27 hoverable">call</span> it
the inner Agni-hotra. So <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> as a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> speaks, he
cannot breathe, he offers all the while his prana
(breath) in his speech. And so <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> as a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> breathes,
he cannot speak, he offers all the while his speech
in his breath. These <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> endless and immortal oblations
he offers always, <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> waking or sleeping.
Whatever other oblations there are (those, e.g. of the
ordinary Agnihotra, consisting of milk and other
things), they have an end, for they consist of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span>
(which, like all works, have an end). The ancients,
knowing this (the best Agnihotra), did not offer the
(ordinary) Agnihotra.
2:6. Uktha is Brahman, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> said Sushkabhringara. Let
him meditate on it (the uktha) as the same with
the Rik, and all <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> will praise him as the best. Let
him meditate on it as the same with the Yagus, and
all <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> will join before him as the best. Let him
meditate on it as the same with the Saman, and all
<span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> will bow before him as the best. Let him meditate
on it as the same with might, let him meditate on
it as the same with glory, let him meditate on it as the
same with splendour. For as the bow is among
weapons the mightiest, the most glorious, the most
splendid, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> is he who knows this among all <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span>
the mightiest, the most glorious, the most splendid. The
Adhvaryu conceives the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> of the altar, which is
276

used for the sacrifice, to be himself. In it he (the
Adhvaryu) weaves the Yagus portion of the sacrifice.
And in the Yagus portion the Hotri weaves the Rik portion
of the sacrifice. And in the Rik portion the
Udgatri weaves the Saman portion of the sacrifice. He
(the Adhvaryu or prana) is the self of the threefold
knowledge; he indeed is the self of it (of prana). He who
knows this is the self of it (becomes prana).
2:7. Next follow the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> kinds of <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> of the allconquering (sarvagit) Kaushitaki. The allconquering Kaushitaki adores the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> when rising, having
put on the sacrificial cord, having <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span>
water, and having thrice sprinkled the water-cup, saying:
`Thou <span class="t2 t6 t8 t9 t10 t15 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">art</span> the deliverer, deliver me from sin.' In
the same manner he adores the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> when in the zenith,
saying: `Thou <span class="t2 t6 t8 t9 t10 t15 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">art</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> deliverer, deliver me
highly from sin.' In the same manner he adores the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span>
when setting, saying: `Thou <span class="t2 t6 t8 t9 t10 t15 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">art</span> the <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span> deliverer,
deliver me fully from sin.' <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> he fully removes whatever

the same manner he who knows this, likewise adores the
sun, and fully removes whatever <span class="t0 t9 t11 t14 t17 t28 hoverable">sin</span> he
committed by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> and by night.
2:8. Then (secondly) let him worship every month (in the
year) at the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of the new moon, the moon as
it is seen in the west in the same manner (as before
described with regard to the sun), or let him send forth
his speech toward the moon with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> green blades of

`Pratardana, let me give you a boon to choose.' And
Pratardana answered: `Do you yourself choose that boon
for me which you deem most beneficial for a
man.' Indra said to him: `No one who chooses, chooses
for another; choose thyself.' Then Pratardana
replied: `Then that boon to choose is no boon for me.'
Then, however, Indra did not swerve from the truth, for
Indra is truth. Indra said to him: `Know me only;
that is what I deem most beneficial for man, that he
should know me. I slew the three-headed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> of

pranas perceive all these together, one by one.
While speech speaks, all pranas <span class="t9 t11 t20 t21 t22 t23 t27 hoverable">speak</span> after it. While the
eye sees, all pranas see after it. While the ear
hears, all pranas hear after it. While the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> thinks, all

`Thus it is indeed,' said Indra, `but nevertheless there is a
pre-eminence among the pranas.

they go out of it. Of that, this is the evidence, this is the
understanding. When a man, being <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> asleep,
sees no dream whatever, he becomes one with that
prana alone. Then speech goes to him (when he is
absorbed in prana) with all names, the eye with all forms,
the ear with all sounds, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> with all

Of this, this is the proof, this is the understanding. When
a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> sick, going to die, falling into

departed, he hears not, he sees not, he speaks not, he
thinks not.' Then he becomes one with that prana alone.
Then speech goes to him (who is absorbed in
prana) with all names, the eye with all forms, the ear with
all sounds, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> with all thoughts. And
when he departs from this body, he departs <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> with
all these.
3:4. Speech gives up to him (who is absorbed in prana)
all names, so that by speech he obtains all names.
The nose gives up to him all odours, so that by scent he
obtains all odours. The eye gives up to him all
forms, so that by the eye he obtains all forms. The ear
gives up to him all sounds, so that by the ear he
obtains all sounds. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> gives up to him all

284

This is the complete absorption in prana. And what is
prana is pragna (self-consciousness), what is
pragna (self-consciousness) is prana. For <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> do

him I meditate.'
Agatasatru said to him: `Do not challenge me on this. I
meditate on him as death. Whoso meditates on
him thus, neither he himself nor his offspring will die

4:15. Balaki said: `The <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> that is embodied, on him I

Agatasatru said to him: `Do not challenge me on this. I

meditates on him thus, is multiplied in offspring and
cattle.'
4:16. Balaki said: `The Self which is conscious (pragna),
and by whom he who sleeps here, walks about
in sleep, on him I meditate.'
Agatasatru said to him: `Do not challenge me on this. I
meditate on him as Yama the king. Whoso
meditates on him thus, everything is subdued for his
excellencies.'
4:17. Balaki said: `The <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> that is in the right eye, on
him I meditate.'
Agatastru said to him: `Do not challenge me on this. I
meditate on him as the self of the name, as the
self of fire, as the self of splendour. Whoso meditates on
him thus, he becomes the self of these.'
4:18. Balaki said: `The <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> that is in the <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> eye, on

Agatastru said to him: `Do not challenge me on this. I
meditate on him as the self of the true, as the self
of lightning, as the self of light. Whoso meditates on him
thus, he becomes the self of these.'
4:19. After this Balaki became silent. Agatastru said to
him: `Thus far only (do you know), O Balaki?'
`Thus far only,' replied Balaki.
Then Agatastru said to him: `Vainly did you challenge
me, saying: `Shall I tell you Brahman? O Balaki,
he who is the maker of those persons (whom you
mentioned), he of whom all this is the work, he alone is
to be known.'
Thereupon Balaki came, carrying fuel in his hand,
saying: `May I come to you as a pupil?' Agatastru
said to him: `I deem it improper that a Kshatriya should
initiate a Brahmana. Come, I shall make you
know clearly.' Then taking him by the hand, he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span>

he remained lying. Then he pushed him with a stick, and
he rose at once. Then said Agatastru to him:
`Balaki, where did this <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> here sleep? Where was

Note: This Upanishad, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> apparently simple and
intelligible is in reality one of the most difficult to
understand properly. Coming at the end of the
Vagasaneyi-samhita in which the sacrifices and the
hymns
297

to be <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> by the officiating priests have been described,
it begins by declaring that all has to be
surrendered to the Lord. The name is, lord, is peculiar,
as having a far more personal colouring than
Atman, Self, or Brahman, the usual names given by the
Upanishads to what is the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span>
knowledge.
Next follows a permission to continue the performance of
sacrifices, provided that all desires have been
surrendered. And here occurs our first difficulty which
has perplexed ancient as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as modern
commentators.
I shall tray, first of all, to justify my own translation. I hold
that the Upanishad wishes to teach the
uselessness by themselves of all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> works, <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> we
<span class="t3 t11 t18 t27 hoverable">call</span> them sacrificial, legal, or moral, and yet, at
the time, to recognise, if not the necessity, at least the
harmlessness of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> works, provided they are
performed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> any selfish motives, withoug any <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span>
of reward, but simply as a preparation for
<span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> knowledge, as a means, in fact, of subduing all
passions, and producing that serenity of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span>

knowledge. From that point of <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> the
Upanishad may <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> say, Let a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> wish to live here his

him. It will not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> on and produce effect after effect,
nor will it involve him in a succession of new
births in which to enjoy the reward of his works, but it will
leave him <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> to enjoy the blessings of the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> knowledge. It will have served as a preparation
for that <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> which the Upanishad
imparts, and which secures freedom from further births.
The expression `na karma lipyate nare' seems to me to
admit of this one explanation only, that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> done

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> knowledge. Similar expressions occur again
and again. Lip was, no doubt, <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> originally of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span>

but afterwards of all work, even of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> work, if done with
a <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> of reward. The doctrine of the
298

Upanishads is throughout that orthodoxy and <span class="t2 t9 t10 t16 t18 t19 t27 t28 hoverable">sacrifice</span>
can procure a limited beatitude only, and that they
are a hindrance to real salvation, which can be obtained
by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> alone.

Sankara, in his colamentary on the Vedanta-sutras III, 4,
7; 13; 14, takes the same <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of this passage.
The opponent of Badarayana, in this case, Gaimini
himself; maintains that karma, work, is indispensable
to knowledge, and among other arguments, he says, III,
4, 7, that it is so `Niyamat,' `Because it is so laid
down by the law.' The <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> here referred to is,
according to Sankara, our very verse, which, he thinks,
should be translated as follows: `Let a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> wish to live a

which to escape the influence of works.' In answer to
this, Badarayana says, first of all, III, 4, 13, that this
rule may refer to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> in general, and not to one who
knows; or, III, 4, 14, if it refers to a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> who knows,
that then the permission to perform <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> is only intended
to exhalt the value of knowledge, the <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span>

The same Sankara, however, who here sees quite clearly
that this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">verse</span> refers to a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> who knows,
explains it in the Upanishad as referring to a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> who

The verses 9-14 are again <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span> of difficulty, not so much in
themselves as in relation to the general system
of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> which prevails in the Upanishads, and forms
the foundation of the Vedanta philosophy. The
commentators vary considerably in their interpretations.
Sankara explains avidya, not-knowledge, by
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> works, particularly sacrifice, performed with a hope
of reward; vidya, or knowledge, by a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span>
of the gods, but not, as yet, of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Brahman. The
former is generally supposed to lead the
sacrificer to the pitriloka, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> of the fathers, from
whence he returns to a new series of births; the
latter to the devaloka, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> of the gods, from whence
he may either proceed to Brahman, or enter
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> a new round of existence. The question then
arises, how in our <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> the former could be said to
lead to blind darkness, the latter to still greater darkness.
But for that statement, I have no doubt that all
300

the commentators would, as usual, have <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> vidya for
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">Highest</span> Brahman, and
avidya for orthodox belief in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> works, the
former securing in immortality in the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> of
freedom from new births, while the reward of the latter is
blessedness in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heaven</span> for a limited period, but

This antithesis between vidya and avidya seems to me so
firmly established that I cannot <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> myself to

before (ver. 3), that those who have destroyed their

this, how, while the orthodox believer is said to

enter into still greater darkness. While Sankara in this
<span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> seems hardly to have caught the drift of the
Upanishad, Uvata and Mahidhara propose an explanation
which is far more satisfactory. They perceive
that the chief stress must be laid on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> ubhayam

doctrine of certain Vedanta philosophers was that works,

knowledge, and that those who imagine that they can

into darkness, but that those who delight altogether
in knowledge, despising the previous discipline of works,
deceive themselves and enter into still greater
darkness.
Then follows the next verse, simply stating that, according
to the teaching of <span class="t8 t12 t17 hoverable">wise</span> people, the reward of
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> is one thing, the reward of ignorance, i.e. trust
in sacrifice, other. Here Mahidhara is right
again by assigning the pitriloka, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> of the fathers,

Mahidhara's view. Here it is laid down distinctly
that he only who knows both together, both what is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span>

obtains the Immortal, here explained by oneness with the

Brahman.
Uvata, who takes the same <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of these verses, explains
at once, and even more boldly than Mahidhara
vidya, or knowledge, by brahavignana, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of

asambhuti instead of vidy and avidya, stand first
in the Vagasaneyi-samhita. They must necessarily be
explained in accordance with our explanation of
the former verses, i.e. sambhuti must correspond to
vidya, it must be meant for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> cause, i.e. for
Brahman, while asambhuti must correspond with avidya,
as a name of what is not real but phenomenal
only and perishable.
Mahidhara thinks that these verses refer to the
Bauddhas, which can hardly be admitted, unless we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span>

Buddhist in a very general sense. Uvata puts the
Lokayatas in their place. It is curious also to observe
that Mahidhara, following Uvata, explains asambhuti at
first by the denial of the resurrection of the body,
while he takes sambhuti rightly for Brahman. I have
chiely followed Uvata's commentary, except in his
first explanation of asambhuti, resurrection. In what
follows Uvata explains sambhuti rightly by the only
cause fo the origin of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> world, i.e. Brahman, while
he takes vinasa, destruction, as a name of the
perishable body.
Sankara sees much more in these verses than Uvata. He
takes asambhuti as a name of Prakriti, the
undeveloped cause, sambhuti as as a name of the
phenomenal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> or Hiranyagarbha. From a
worship of the latter a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> obtains supernataral powers,
from devotion to the former, absorption in
Prakriti.
Mahidhara also takes a similar view, and he allows, like
Sankara, another reading, viz. sambhutim
avinasam ka, and avinasena mrityum tirtva. In this <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span>
the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be: `He who knows the worship
both of the developed and the undeveloped, overcomes
death, it.e. such <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> as sin, passion, &c., through
worship of the undeveloped, while he obtains through
worship of the developed, i.e. of Hiranyagarbha,
immortality, absorption in Prakriti.'
All these forced explanations to which the commentators
have recourse, arise from the shifting views held
by various authorities with regard to the value of works.
Our Upanishad seems to me to propound the
doctrine that works, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> in themselves useless, or
even mischievous, if performed with a <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> to any

discipline. This is or was for a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> the
orthodox view. Each <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> was required to <span class="t6 t9 t13 t15 t17 t18 t23 t28 t29 hoverable">pass</span> through
the asramas, or stages of student and householder, before he was admitted to the freedom of a
Sannyasin. As on a ladder, no step was to be skipped.
Those who attempted to do so were considered to have
broken the old law, and in some respects they may
indeed be looked <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> precursors of the

unwillingness to assent to the decided teaching of the Isaupanishad that Sankara attempted to explain vidya,
knowledge, in a limited sense, as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of the

How misleading Sankara's explanation may prove, we
can see from the translation of this Upanishad by
Rammohun Roy. He followed Sankara implicitly, and this
is the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> which he drew from the text:
`9. Those observers of religious rites that perform only the
worship of the sacred fire, and oblations to
sages, to ancestors, to men, and to other creatures,

sacred fire, and oblations to sages, to ancestors, to
men, and to other creatures, shall enter into a regon still
darker than the former.
`10. It is said that adoration of the celestial <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> produces
one consequence; and that the performance of
the worship of sacred fire, and oblations to sages, to
ancestors, to men, and to other creatures, produce

worship of the sacred fire, and oblation to the sages, to
ancestors, to men, and to other creatures, should be

both, will, by means of the latter, surmount the
obstacles presented by natural temptations, and will
attain the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of the celestial <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> through the
practice of the former.
`12. Those observers of religious rites who worship
Prakriti alone (Prakriti or nature, who, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span>

throughout the universe) shall enter into the dark
region: and those practisers of religious ceremonies that
are devoted to worship solely the prior operating
sensitive particle, allegorically <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Brahma, shall enter
into a region much more dark than the former.
`13. It is said that one consequence may be attained by
the worship of Brahma, and another by the
adoration of Prakriti. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> have we <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> from learned
men, who have distinctly explained the subject to

`14. Of those observers of ceremonies, whatever person,
knowing that the adoration of Prakriti and that of
Brahma should be <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> observed by the same

latter overcome indigence, and will attain the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of
Prakriti, through the practice of the former.'

1-2:1. Om! Let us explain Siksha, the doctrine of

Now let us explain the Upanishad (the secret meaning) of
the union (samhita), under five heads, with
regard to the worlds, the heavenly lights, knowledge,
offspring, and self (body). <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">People</span> <span class="t3 t11 t18 t27 hoverable">call</span> these the

First, with regard to the worlds. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> is the former
element, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heaven</span> the latter, ether their union;
1-3:2. That union takes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> through Vayu (air). So
much with regard to the worlds.
Next, with regard to the heavenly lights. <span class="t4 t6 t9 t10 t12 t14 t17 t18 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">Agni</span> (fire) is the
former element, Aditya (the sun) the latter,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> their union.

lightning. So much with regard to the heavenly lights.

Next, with regard to knowledge. The teacher is the
former element,
1-3:3. The pupil the latter, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> their union. That
union takes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> through the recitation of the
Veda. So much with regard to knowledge.
Next, with regard to offspring. The mother is the former
element, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">father</span> the latter, offspring their
union. That union takes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> through procreation. So
much with regard to offspring.
1-3:4. Next, with regard to the self (body). The lower jaw
is the former element, the upper jaw the latter,
speech their union. That union takes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> through
speech. So much with regard to the Self. These are
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Samhitas. He who knows these Samhitas
(unions), as here explained, becomes united with
offspring, cattle, Vedic light, food, and with the heavenly
world.

Fourth Anuvaka
1-4:1. May he who is the strong bull of the Vedas,
assuming all forms, who has risen from the Vedas,
from the Immortal, may that Indra (lord) strengthen me
with wisdom! May I, O God, become an
upholder of the Immortal!

that Sri (happiness) hither to me, the woolly, with her
cattle! Svaha! May the Brahman-students come to
me, Svaha! May they come from all sides, Svaha! May
they come forth to me, Svaha! May they practise
restraint, Svaha! May they enjoy peace, Svaha!

1-4:3. May I be a <span class="t0 t7 t21 t27 hoverable">glory</span> among men, Svaha! May I be
better than the richest, Svaha! May I enter into
thee, O treasure (Om), Svaha! Thou, O treasure, enter
into me, Svaha! In thee, consisting of a <span class="t15 t23 hoverable">thousand</span>
branches, in thee, O treasure, I am cleansed, Svaha! As

1-5:1. Bhu, Bhuvas, Suvas, these are the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> sacred
interjections (vyahriti). Mahakamasya taught a
fourth, viz. Mahas, which is Brahman, which is the Self.
The others (devatas) are its members.
Bhu is this world, Bhuvas is the sky, Suvas is the other
world.
1-5:2. Mahas is the sun. All the worlds are increased by
the sun. Bhu is <span class="t4 t6 t9 t10 t12 t14 t17 t18 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">Agni</span> (fire), Bhuvas is Vayu
(air), Suvas is Aditya (sun). Mahas is the moon. All the
heavenly lights are increased by the moon.
Bhu is the Rik-verses, Bhuvas is the Saman-verses,
Suvas is the Yagus-verses.
1-5:3. Mahas is Brahman. All the Vedas are increased
by the Brahman.
(1-2) Bhu is Prana (up-breathing), Bhuvas is Apana
(down-breathing), Suvas is Vyana (back-breathing).
Mahas is food. All breathings are increased by food.
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> there are these four times four, the four and four

nipple that is the starting-point of Indra (the

enters <span class="t4 t6 t9 t10 t12 t14 t17 t18 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">Agni</span> (the fire); saying Bhuvas, he enters Vayu
(air);
1-6:2. Saying Suvas, he enters Aditya (sun); saying
Mahas, he enters Brahman. He there obtains
lordship, he reaches the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">lord</span> of the mind. He becomes

the intermediate quarters,' `Agni (fire), Vayu
(air), Aditya (sun), Kandramas (moon), and the stars,'
`Water, herbs, trees, ether, the universal Self

(bhuta).
Now with reference to the self (the body): `Prana (upbreathing), Apana (down-breathing), Vyana (backbreathing), Udana (out-breathing), and Samana (onbreathing),' `The eye, the ear, mind, speech, and
touch,'- `The skin, flesh, muscle, bone, and marrow.'
Having dwelt on this (fivefold arrangement of the
worlds, the gods, beings, breathings, senses, and
elements of the body), a Rishi said: `Whatever exists is
fivefold (pankta).'
333

(1) By means of the one fivefold <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> (that referring to the

On this there is also the following Sloka:
Section 5
Fifth Anuvaka
`Understanding performs the sacrifice, it performs all
sacred acts. All Devas worship understanding as
Brahman, as the oldest. If a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> knows understanding
as Brahman, and if he does not swerve from it, he
leaves all evils behind in the body, and attains all his
wishes.' The embodied Self of this (consisting of
understanding) is the same as that of the former
(consisting of mind).
Different from this, which consists of understanding, is the
other inner Self, which consists of bliss. The
339

former is filled by this. It also has the shape of man. Like
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> shape of the former is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span>

On this there is also the following Sloka:
Section 6
Sixth Anuvaka
`He who knows the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> as non-existing, becomes
himself non-existing. He who knows the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span>
as existing, him we know himself as existing.' The
embodied Self of this (bliss) is the same as that of the
former (understanding).
Thereupon follow the questions of the pupil:
`Does any one who knows not, after he has departed this
life, ever go to that world? Or does he who
knows, after he has departed, go to that world?'
The answer is: He wished, may I be many, may I grow
forth. He brooded over himself (like a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span>

forth (created) all, whatever there is. Having
sent forth, he entered into it. Having entered it, he
became sat (what is manifest) and tyat (what is not

supported, (endowed with) <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span>

<span class="t8 t12 t17 hoverable">wise</span> <span class="t3 t11 t18 t27 hoverable">call</span> it (the Brahman) Sat-tya (the true).
On this there is also this Sloka:
Section 7
Seventh Anuvaka
`In the beginning this was non-existent (not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> defined by

exists. That made itself its Self, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> it is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the
Self-made.' That which is Self-made is a flavour
340

(can be tasted), for only after perceiving a flavour can any
one perceive pleasure. Who could breathe, who
could breathe forth, if that bliss (Brahman) existed not in
the ether (in the heart)? For he alone causes
blessedness.
When he finds freedom from <span class="t28 hoverable">fear</span> and rest in that which is
invisible, incorporeal, undefined, unsupported,
then he has obtained the fearless. For if he makes but
the smallest distinction in it, there is <span class="t28 hoverable">fear</span> for him.
But that <span class="t28 hoverable">fear</span> exists only for one who thinks himself wise,
(not for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> sage.)
On this there is also this Sloka:

commentary on the Brihadaranyaka-upanishad, gives
nearly the same explanation as before; only that he
makes aganadevah still clearer, by explaining them as

The arrangement of these <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> and their worlds, one
rising above the other, reminds us of the

He desired, `Let a <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> be <span class="t16 t24 hoverable">born</span> of me,'
and he (Death or Hunger) embraced Speech in his
mind. Then the seed became the year. Before that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span>
there was no year. Speech bore him so <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> as a

was born, he (Death) opened his mouth, as if to
swallow him. He cried Bhan! and that became speech.

1-2:5. He thought, `If I kill him, I shall have but little food.'
He <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> forth by that speech

the Yagus, the Saman, the metres, the sacrifices,

And whatever he (Death) <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> forth, that he resolved
to <span class="t28 hoverable">eat</span> (ad). Verily because he eats everything,

everything, and everything becomes his food.
1-2:6. He desired to <span class="t2 t9 t10 t16 t18 t19 t27 t28 hoverable">sacrifice</span> again with a greater
sacrifice. He toiled and performed penance. And while
he toiled and performed penance, glorious <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span>
out of him. Verily glorious <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> means the

in the body.
1-2:7. He desired that this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> should be fit for <span class="t2 t9 t10 t16 t18 t19 t27 t28 hoverable">sacrifice</span>

Then he became a horse (asva), because it swelled
(asvat), and was fit for <span class="t2 t9 t10 t16 t18 t19 t27 t28 hoverable">sacrifice</span> (medhya); and this is
why the horse-sacrifice is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Asva-medha.
Verily he who knows him thus, knows the Asvamedha.
Then, letting the horse free, he thought, and at
the end of a year he offered it up for himself, while he
gave up the (other) animals to the deities.
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Therefore</span> the sacrificers offered up the purified horse

Third Brahmana
1-3:1. There were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> kinds of descendants of Pragapati,
the Devas and the Asuras. Now the Devas were
indeed the younger, the Asuras the elder ones. The
Devas, who were struggling in these worlds, said:
`Well, let us overcome the Asuras at the sacrifices (the
Gyotishtoma) by means of the udgitha.'
1-3:2. They said to speech (Vak): `Do <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thou</span> sing out for
us (the udgitha).' `Yes,' said speech, and sang (the
udgitha). Whatever delight there is in speech, that she
obtained for the Devas by singing (the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span>

nine pavamanas), that was for herself. The
Asuras knew: `Verily, through this singer they will
overcome us.' They <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> rushed at the singer and
pierced her with evil. That <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> which consists in saying
what is bad, that is that evil.
1-3:3. Then they (the Devas) said to breath (scent): `Do
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thou</span> sing out for us.' `Yes,' said breath, and
sang. Whatever delight there is in breath (smell), that he
obtained for the Devas by singing; but that he
smelled well, that was for himself. The Asuras knew:
`Verily, through this singer they will overcome us.'
They <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> rushed at the singer, and pierced him with

is bad, that is that evil.
1-3:4. Then they said to the eye: `Do <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thou</span> sing out for

delight there is in the eye, that he obtained for the Devas
by singing; but that he saw well, that was for
himself. The Asuras knew: `Verily, through this singer
they will overcome us.' They <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> rushed at
the singer, and pierced him with evil. That <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> which
consists in seeing what is bad, that is that evil.
1-3:5. Then they said to the ear: `Do <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thou</span> sing out for us.'
`Yes,' said the ear, and sang. Whatever
delight there is in the ear, that he obtained for the Devas
by singing; but that he <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> well, that was for
himself. The Asuras knew: `Verily, through this singer
they will overcome us.' They <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> rushed at

the singer, and pierced him with evil. That <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> which
consists in hearing what is bad, that is that evil.
1-3:6. Then they said to the mind: `Do <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thou</span> sing out for

by singing; but that he <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> well, that was
for himself. The Asuras knew: `Verily, through this singer
they will overcome us.' They <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> rushed

pierced them with evil.
1-3:7. Then they said to the breath in the mouth: `Do

The Asuras knew: `Verily, through this singer they will

pierced him with evil. Now as a ball of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> will be

scattered in all directions. Hence the Devas rose, the
Asuras fell. He who knows this, rises by his self,
and the enemy who hates him falls.
1-3:8. Then they (the Devas) said: `Where was he then
who <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> stuck to us?' It was (the breath) <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span>

those deities, viz. death, carried them beyond
death.

1-3:12. He carried speech across first. When speech
had become freed from death, it became (what it had
been before) <span class="t4 t6 t9 t10 t12 t14 t17 t18 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">Agni</span> (fire). That Agni, after having stepped
beyond death, shines.
1-3:13. Then he carried breath (scent) across. When
breath had become freed from death, it became
Vayu (air). That Vayu, after having stepped beyond
death, blows.
1-3:14. Then he carried the eye across. When the eye
had become freed from death, it became Aditya
(the sun). That Aditya, after having stepped beyond
death, burns.
1-3:15. Then he carried the ear across. When the ear
had become freed from death, it became the
quarters (space). These are our quarters (space), which

had become freed from death, it became the
moon (Kandramas). That moon, after having stepped
beyond death, shines. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> does that deity carry
him, who knows this, across death.
1-3:17. Then breath (vital), by singing, obtained for
himself eatable food. For whatever <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> is eaten, is
eaten by breath alone, and in it breath rests.
The Devas said: `Verily, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> far, whatever <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> there is,

there, enter into me.' They said Yes, and entered all
into him. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Therefore</span> whatever <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> is eaten by breath, by
it the other senses are satisfied.
1-3:18. If a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> knows this, then his own relations come
to him in the same manner; he becomes their
supporter, their chief leader, their strong ruler. And if ever
any one tries to oppose one who is possessed
of such <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> among his own relatives, then he will
not be able to support his own belongings. But

that limb withers, for breath verily is the sap of the limbs.
1-3:20. He (breath) is also Brihaspati, for speech is
Brihati (Rig-veda), and he is her lord; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> he is

1-3:21. He (breath) is also Brahmanaspati, for speech is

He (breath) is also Saman (the Udgitha), for speech is
Saman (Sama-veda), and that is both speech (sa)
and breath (ama). This is why Saman is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Saman.

and oneness with Saman.
1-3:23. He (breath) is Udgitha. Breath verily is Ut, for by
breath this universe is upheld (uttabdha); and
speech is Githa, song. And because he is ut and githa,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> he (breath) is Udgitha.

sang another Udgitha than this. He sang it indeed
as speech and breath.'
1-3:25. He who knows what is the property of this
Saman, obtains property. Now verily its property is
tone only. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Therefore</span> let a priest, who is going to perform

the property of that Saman, obtains property.
1-3:26. He who knows what is the gold of that Saman,
obtains gold. Now verily its gold is tone only. He
who <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> knows what is the gold of that Saman, obtains
gold.
1-3:27. He who knows what is the support of that Saman,
he is supported. Now verily its support is
speech only. For, as supported in speech, that breath is
sung as that Saman. Some say the support is in
food.
Next follows the Abhyaroha (the ascension) of the
Pavamana verses. Verily the Prastotri begins to sing the
Saman, and when he begins, then let him (the sacrificer)
recite these (three Yagus-verses):
`Lead me from the unreal to the real! Lead me from
darkness to light! Lead me from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">death</span> to
immortality!'
Now when he says, `Lead me from the unreal to the real,'
the unreal is verily death, the real immortality.
He <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> says, `Lead me from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">death</span> to immortality,
make me immortal.'
When he says, `Lead me from darkness to light,'
darkness is verily death, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> immortality.

When he says, `Lead me from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">death</span> to immortality,' there
is nothing there, as it were, hidden (obscure,
requiring explanation).
1-3:28. Next come the other Stotras with which the priest
may obtain <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> for himself by singing them.
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Therefore</span> let the sacrificer, while these Stotras are being
sung, ask for a boon, whatever <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> he may

singing whatever <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> he may <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> either for

Fourth Brahmana
1-4:1. In the beginning this was Self alone, in the shape
of a <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> (purusha). He looking round saw
nothing but his Self. He first said, `This is I;' <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> he

pronounces the other name which he may have. And
because before (purva) all this, he (the Self) burnt down
(ush) all evils, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> he was a <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> (purusha).

1-4:2. He feared, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> any one who is lonely
fears. He thought, `As there is nothing but myself,
why should I fear?' Thence his <span class="t28 hoverable">fear</span> passed away. For
what should he have feared? Verily <span class="t28 hoverable">fear</span> arises
from a <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> only.

But he felt no delight. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Therefore</span> a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> who is

He was so large as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> and wife together. He then
made this his Self to fall in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> (pat), and thence

1-4:4. She thought, `How can he embrace me, after
having produced me from himself? I shall hide
myself.'
She then became a cow, the other became a bull and
embraced her, and hence cows were born. The one
became a mare, the other a stallion; the one a male ass,
the other a female ass. He embraced her, and
hence one-hoofed animals were born. The one became
a she-goat, the other a he-goat; the one became a
ewe, the other a ram. He embraced her, and hence
goats and sheep were born. And <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> he <span class="t16 hoverable">created</span>

who knows this lives in this his creation.
1-4:6. Next he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> produced <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> by rubbing.

Now, whatever there is moist, that he <span class="t16 hoverable">created</span> from seed;
this is Soma. So far verily is this universe either
<span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> or eater. Soma indeed is food, <span class="t4 t6 t9 t10 t12 t14 t17 t18 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">Agni</span> eater. This is
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span> of Brahman, when he <span class="t16 hoverable">created</span>
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> from his better part, and when he, who was
(then) mortal, <span class="t16 hoverable">created</span> the immortals. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Therefore</span> it
was the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> creation. And he who knows this, lives in
this his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> creation.
1-4:7. Now all this was then undeveloped. It became
developed by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> and name, so that one could say,
`He, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> so and so, is such a one.' <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Therefore</span> at present
also all this is developed by name and form, so
that one can say, `He, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> so and so, is such a one.'
He (Brahman or the Self) entered thither, to the very tips
of the finger-nails, as a razor might be fitted in a
razor-case, or as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> in a fire-place.
He cannot be seen, for, in part only, when breathing, he is
breath by name; when speaking, speech by
name; when seeing, eye by name; when hearing, ear by
name; when thinking, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> by name. All these
are but the names of his acts. And he who worships
(regards) him as the one or the other, does not know
him, for he is apart from this (when qualified) by the one
or the other (predicate). Let <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> worship him
as Self, for in the Self all these are one. This Self is the
footstep of everything, for through it one knows
359

everything. And as one can <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> again by footsteps what
was lost, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> he who knows this finds <span class="t0 t7 t21 t27 hoverable">glory</span> and
praise.
1-4:8. This, which is nearer to us than anything, this Self,
is dearer than a son, dearer than wealth, dearer
than all else.
And if one were to say to one who declares another than
the Self dear, that he will lose what is dear to
him, very likely it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be so. Let him worship the Self
alone as dear. He who worships the Self alone
as dear, the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of his <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t8 t13 t15 t17 t18 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> will never perish.
1-4:9. Here they say: `If <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> think that by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of

then did that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> know, from whence all this
sprang?'
1-4:10. Verily in the beginning this was Brahman, that
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> knew (its) Self only, saying, `I am
Brahman.' From it all this sprang. Thus, whatever Deva
was awakened (so as to know Brahman), he
indeed became that (Brahman); and the same with Rishis
and men. The Rishi Vamadeva saw and
understood it, singing, `I was Manu (moon), I was the
sun.' <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Therefore</span> now also he who <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> knows that
he is Brahman, becomes all this, and even the Devas
cannot prevent it, for he himself is their Self.
Now if a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> worships another deity, thinking the deity is
one and he another, he does not know. He is
like a beast for the Devas. For verily, as many beasts
nourish a man, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> does every <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> nourish the

how much more when many are taken!
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Therefore</span> it is not pleasant to the Devas that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> should
know this.
1-4:11. Verily in the beginning this was Brahman, one
only. That being one, was not strong enough. It
<span class="t16 hoverable">created</span> still further the most excellent Kshatra (power),
viz. those Kshatras (powers) among the Devas,
Indra, Varuna, Soma, Rudra, Parganya, Yama, Mrityu,
Isana. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Therefore</span> there is nothing beyond the

He who injures him, injures his own birth-place. He
becomes worse, because he has injured one better

1-4:12. He was not strong enough. He <span class="t16 hoverable">created</span> the Vis
(people), the classes of Devas which in their
different orders are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Vasus, Rudras, Adityas, Visve

reasoned.
1-4:17. In the beginning this was Self alone, one only.
He desired, `Let there be a wife for me that I may
have offspring, and let there be wealth for me that I may
offer sacrifices.' Verily this is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> desire,

so <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> as he does not obtain either of these things, he

the fivefold sacrifice, for fivefold is the animal,
fivefold man, fivefold all this whatsoever. He who knows
this, obtains all this.

1-5:1. `When the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">father</span> (of creation) had produced by

food, one of his (foods) was common to all beings, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> he
assigned to the Devas, (1)
`Three he made for himself, one he gave to the animals.
In it all rests, whatsoever breathes and breathes
not. (2)
`Why then do these not perish, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> they are always
eaten? He who knows this imperishable one, he
eats <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> with his face. (3)
He goes even to the Devas, he lives on strength.' (4)
1-5:2. When it is said, that `the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">father</span> produced by

clear that (it was he who) did so. When it is said, that
`one of his (foods) was common,' then that is that
common <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> of his which is eaten. He who worships
(eats) that (common food), is not removed from
evil, for verily that <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> is mixed (property). When it is
said, that `two he assigned to the Devas,' that is
the huta, which is sacrificed in fire, and the prahuta, which
is given away at a sacrifice. But they also say,
the new-moon and full-moon sacrifices are here intended,
and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> one should not offer them as an
ishti or with a wish.
When it is said, that `one he gave to animals,' that is milk.
For in the beginning (in their infancy) both
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> and animals live on milk. And <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> they either
make a new-born child lick ghrita (butter), or
they make it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> the breast. And they <span class="t3 t11 t18 t27 hoverable">call</span> a new-born
creature `atrinada,' i.e. not eating herbs. When it
is said, that `in it all rests, whatsoever breathes and
breathes not,' we see that all this, whatsoever breathes
and breathes not, rests and depends on milk.
And when it is said (in another Brahmana), that a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span>

No, on the very <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> on

entire <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> (viz. milk).

When it is said, `Why do these not perish, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> they

the imperishable, and he produces that <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> again and
again.
When it is said, `He who knows this imperishable one,'
then, verily, the <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">Person</span> is the imperishable one,
for he produces this <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> by repeated thought, and
whatever he does not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> by his works, that perishes.
When it is said, that `he eats <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> with his face,' then face
means the mouth, he eats it with his mouth.
When it is said, that `he goes even to the Devas, he lives
on strength,' that is meant as praise.
1-5:3. When it is said, that `he made <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> for himself,'
that means that he made mind, speech, and breath
for himself. As <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> say, `My <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> was elsewhere, I

mind.
Whatever sound there is, that is speech. Speech indeed
is intended for an end or object, it is nothing by
itself.
The up-breathing, the down-breathing, the backbreathing, the out-breathing, the on-breathing, all that is
breathing is breath (prana) only. Verily that Self consists
of it; that Self consists of speech, mind, and
breath.

2-1:1. There was formerly the proud Gargya Balaki, a

He said to Agatasatru of
Kasi, `Shall I tell you Brahman?' Agatasatru said: `We
give a <span class="t15 t23 hoverable">thousand</span> (cows) for that speech (of yours),

2-1:2. Gargya said: `The <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> that is in the sun, that I
adore as Brahman.' Agatasatru said to him: `No,
no! Do not <span class="t9 t11 t20 t21 t22 t23 t27 hoverable">speak</span> to me on this. I adore him verily as the
supreme, the <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> of all beings, the king.
Whoso adores him thus, becomes supreme, the <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> of
all beings, a king.'
2-1:3. Gargya said: `The <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> that is in the moon (and
in the mind), that I adore as Brahman.'
Agatasatru said to him: `No, no! Do not <span class="t9 t11 t20 t21 t22 t23 t27 hoverable">speak</span> to me on
this. I adore him verily as the great, clad in
white raiment, as Soma, the king.' Whoso adores him
thus, Soma is poured out and poured forth for him

Agatasatru said to him: `No, no! Do not <span class="t9 t11 t20 t21 t22 t23 t27 hoverable">speak</span> to me on
this. I adore him verily as the luminous.' Whoso
adores him thus, becomes luminous, and his offspring
becomes luminous.

2-1:5. Gargya said: `The <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> that is in the ether (and
in the ether of the heart), that I adore as
Brahman.' Agatasatru said to him: `No, no! Do not <span class="t9 t11 t20 t21 t22 t23 t27 hoverable">speak</span>
to me on this. I adore him as what is full, and
quiescent.' Whoso adores him thus, becomes filled with
offspring and cattle, and his offspring does not
cease from this world.
2-1:6. Gargya said: `The <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> that is in the wind (and
in the breath), that I adore as Brahman.'
Agatasatru said to him: `No, no! Do not <span class="t9 t11 t20 t21 t22 t23 t27 hoverable">speak</span> to me on
this. I adore him as Indra Vaikuntha, as the
unconquerable army (of the Maruts).' Whoso adores him
thus, becomes victorious, unconquerable,
conquering his enemies.
2-1:7. Gargya said: `The <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> that is in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> (and in

Agatasatru said to him: `No, no! Do not <span class="t9 t11 t20 t21 t22 t23 t27 hoverable">speak</span> to me on
this. I adore him as powerful.' Whoso adores
him thus, becomes powerful, and his offspring becomes
powerful.
2-1:8. Gargya said: `The <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> that is in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> (in

Agatasatru said to him: `No, no! Do not <span class="t9 t11 t20 t21 t22 t23 t27 hoverable">speak</span> to me on
this. I adore him as likeness.' Whoso adores him
thus, to him comes what is likely (or proper), not what is
improper; what is <span class="t16 t24 hoverable">born</span> from him, is like <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">unto</span>

2-1:9. Gargya said: `The <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> that is in the mirror, that
I adore as Brahman.' Agatasatru said to him:
`No, no! Do not <span class="t9 t11 t20 t21 t22 t23 t27 hoverable">speak</span> to me on this. I adore him verily
as the brilliant.' Whoso adores him thus, he
becomes brilliant, his offspring becomes brilliant, and with
whomsoever he comes together, he outshines
them.
2-1:10. Gargya said: `The sound that follows a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> while

Agatasatru said to him: `No, no! Do not <span class="t9 t11 t20 t21 t22 t23 t27 hoverable">speak</span> to me on
this. I adore him verily as life.' Whoso adores
him thus, he reaches his <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span> age in this world, breath
does not leave him before the time.

2-1:11. Gargya said: `The <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> that is in space, that I
adore as Brahman.' Agatasatru said to him: `No,
no! Do not <span class="t9 t11 t20 t21 t22 t23 t27 hoverable">speak</span> to me on this. I adore him verily as the
<span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> who never leaves us.' Whoso adores
him thus, becomes possessed of a second, his party is
not cut off from him.
2-1:12. Gargya said: `The <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> that consists of the
shadow, that I adore as Brahman.' Agatasatru said
to him: `No, no! Do not <span class="t9 t11 t20 t21 t22 t23 t27 hoverable">speak</span> to me on this. I adore him
verily as death.' Whoso adores him thus, he
reaches his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> age in this world, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">death</span> does not
approach him before the time.
2-1:13. Gargya said: `The <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> that is in the body, that
I adore as Brahman.' Agatasatru said to him:
`No, no! Do not <span class="t9 t11 t20 t21 t22 t23 t27 hoverable">speak</span> to me on this. I adore him verily
as embodied.' Whoso adores him thus, becomes
embodied, and his offspring becomes embodied.
Then Gargya became silent.
2-1:14. Agatasatru said: `Thus far only?' `Thus far only,'
he replied. Agatasatru said: `This does not
suffice to know it (the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> Brahman).' Gargya replied:
`Then let me come to you, as a pupil.'
2-1:15. Agatasatru said: `Verily, it is unnatural that a
Brahmana should come to a Kshatriya, hoping that
he should tell him the Brahman. However, I shall make
you know him clearly,' <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> saying he <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> him

And the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> came to a <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> who was asleep.
He <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> him by these names, `Thou, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> one,

rubbing him with his hand, he woke him, and
he arose.
2-1:16. Agatasatru said: `When this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span>

Gargya did not know this?
2-1:17. Agatasatru said: `When this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span>

2-1:18. But when he moves about in sleep (and dream),
then these are his worlds. He is, as it were, a

does never perish.
2-2:3. On this there is this Sloka:
`There is a cup having its mouth below and its bottom
above. Manifold <span class="t0 t7 t21 t27 hoverable">glory</span> has been placed into it. On
its lip sit the seven Rishis, the tongue as the eighth
communicates with Brahman.' What is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the cup
having its mouth below and its bottom above is this head,
for its mouth (the mouth) is below, its bottom
(the skull) is above. When it is said that manifold <span class="t0 t7 t21 t27 hoverable">glory</span>
has been placed into it, the senses verily are
manifold glory, and he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> means the senses.
When he says that the seven Rishis sit on its lip, the
Rishis are verily the (active) senses, and he means the
senses. And when he says that the tongue as the
eighth communicates with Brahman, it is because the
tongue, as the eighth, does communicate with
Brahman.
2-2:4. These <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> (the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> ears) are the Rishis Gautama

is eaten, and Atri is meant for Atti, eating. He
who knows this, becomes an eater of everything, and
everything becomes his food.

<span class="t7 hoverable">Third</span> Brahmana
2-3:1. There are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> forms of Brahman, the material and
the immaterial, the mortal and the immortal,
373

the solid and the fluid, sat (being) and tya (that), (i.e. sattya, true).
2-3:2. Everything except air and sky is material, is mortal,
is solid, is definite. The essence of that which
is material, which is mortal, which is solid, which is
definite is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> that shines, for he is the essence of
sat (the definite).
2-3:3. But air and sky are immaterial, are immortal, are
fluid, are indefinite. The essence of that which is
immaterial, which is immortal, which is fluid, which is
indefinite is the <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> in the disk of the sun, for
he is the essence of tyad (the indefinite). So far with
regard to the Devas.
2-3:4. Now with regard to the body. Everything except
the breath and the ether <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> is
material, is mortal, is solid, is definite. The essence of
that which is material, which is mortal, which is
solid, which is definite is the Eye, for it is the essence of
sat (the definite).
2-3:5. But breath and the ether <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> are
immaterial, are immortal, are fluid, are indefinite.
The essence of that which is immaterial, which is
immortal, which is fluid, which is indefinite is the
<span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> in the right eye, for he is the essence of tyad (the
indefinite).
2-3:6. And what is the appearance of that person? Like
a saffron-coloured raiment, like white wool, like
cochineal, like the flame of fire, like the white lotus, like
sudden lightning. He who knows this, his <span class="t0 t7 t21 t27 hoverable">glory</span>
is like <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">unto</span> sudden lightning.
Next follows the teaching (of Brahman) by No, no! for
there is nothing else <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> than this (if one says):
`It is not so.' Then comes the name `the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">True</span> of the

2-4:1. Now when Yagnavalkya was going to enter <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span>
another state, he said: `Maitreyi, verily I am
going away from this my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> (into the forest).

that Katyayani (my other wife).'
2-4:2. Maitreyi said: `My Lord, if this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> earth, <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span> of

`No,' replied Yagnavalkya; `like the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of rich <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> will

by wealth.'
2-4:3. And Maitreyi said: `What should I do with that by
which I do not become immortal? What my

2-4:4. Yagnavalkya replied: `Thou who <span class="t2 t6 t8 t9 t10 t15 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">art</span> truly dear to
me, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thou</span> speakest dear words. Come, sit down, I

`Verily, the Self is to be seen, to be heard, to be

perceive, and know the Self, then all this is known.
2-4:6. `Whosoever looks for the Brahman-class
elsewhere than in the Self, was abandoned by the
Brahman-class. Whosoever looks for the Kshatra-class
elsewhere than in the Self, was abandoned by the
Kshatra-class. Whosoever looks for the worlds elsewhere
than in the Self, was abandoned by the worlds.
Whosoever looks for the Devas elsewhere than in the
Self, was abandoned by the Devas. Whosoever looks

This Brahman-class, this Kshatra-class, these
worlds, these Devas, these creatures, this everything, all
is that Self.

2-4:9. `And as the sounds of a lute, when played, cannot

Yagnavalkya.
2-4:13. Then Maitreyi said: `Here <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thou</span> <span class="t0 t6 t12 t13 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">hast</span> bewildered

there is no more knowledge.'
But Yagnavalkya replied: `O Maitreyi, I say nothing that is
bewildering. This is enough, O beloved, for
wisdom.
`For when there is as it were duality, then one sees the
other, one smells the other, one hears the other,
one salutes the other, one perceives the other, one
knows the other; but when the Self only is all this, how
should he smell another, how should he see another, how
should he hear another, how should he salute
377

another, how should he perceive another, how should he
know another?_ How should he know Him by
whom he knows all this? How, O beloved should he
know (himself), the Knower?'

3-1:1. Ganaka Vaideha (the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> of the Videhas)
sacrificed with a <span class="t2 t9 t10 t16 t18 t19 t27 t28 hoverable">sacrifice</span> at which many presents were
offered to the priests of (the Asvamedha). Brahmanas of
the Kurus and the Pankalas had come thither,
and Ganaka Vaideha wished to know, which of those
Brahmanas was the best read. So he enclosed a
<span class="t15 t23 hoverable">thousand</span> cows, and ten padas (of gold) were fastened to
each pair of horns.
3-1:2. And Ganaka spoke to them: `Ye venerable
Brahmanas, he who among you is the wisest, let him
drive away these cows.'
Then those Brahmanas durst not, but Yagnavalkya said
to his pupil: `Drive them away, my dear.'
He replied: `O <span class="t0 t7 t21 t27 hoverable">glory</span> of the Saman,' and drove them away.
384

The Brahmanas became angry and said: `How could he
<span class="t3 t11 t18 t27 hoverable">call</span> himself the wisest among us?'
Now there was Asvala, the Hotri priest of Ganaka
Vaideha. He asked him: `Are you indeed the wisest
among us, O Yagnavalkya?' He replied: `I bow before the
wisest (the best knower of Brahman), but I wish
indeed to have these cows.'
Then Asvala, the Hotri priest, undertook to question him.
3-1:3. `Yagnavalkya,' he said, `everything here
(connected with the sacrifice) is reached by death,
everything is overcome by death. By what means then is
the sacrificer freed beyond the reach of death?'
Yagnavalkya said: `By the Hotri priest, who is <span class="t4 t6 t9 t10 t12 t14 t17 t18 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">Agni</span> (fire),
who is speech. For speech is the Hotri of the
<span class="t2 t9 t10 t16 t18 t19 t27 t28 hoverable">sacrifice</span> (or the sacrificer), and speech is Agni, and he is
the Hotri. This constitutes freedom, and perfect
freedom (from death).'
3-1:4. `Yagnavalkya,' he said, `everything here is
reached by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> and night, everything is overcome by

beyond the reach of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> and night?'
Yagnavalkya said: `By the Adhvaryu priest, who is the
eye, who is Aditya (the sun). For the eye is the
Adhvaryu of the sacrifice, and the eye is the sun, and he
is the Adhvaryu. This constitutes freedom, and
perfect freedom.'
3-1:5. `Yagnavalkya,' he said, `everything here is
reached by the waxing and waning of the moon,
everything is overcome by the waxing and waning of the
moon. By what means then is the sacrificer
freed beyond the reach of the waxing and waning of the
moon?'
Yagnavalkya said: `By the Udgatri priest, who is Vayu
(the wind), who is the breath. For the breath is the
Udgatri of the sacrifice, and the breath is the wind, and he
is the Udgatri. This constitutes freedom, and
perfect freedom.'
385

3-1:6. `Yagnavalkya,' he said, `this sky is, as it were,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> an ascent (staircase.) By what approach
does the sacrificer approach the Svarga world?'
Yagnavalkya said: `By the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> priest, who is the

For the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> is

and he is the Brahman. This constitutes freedom,
and perfect freedom. These are the complete
deliverances (from death).'
Next follow the achievements.
3-1:7. `Yagnavalkya,' he said, `how many Rik verses will
the Hotri priest employ to-day at this sacrifice?'
`Three,' replied Yagnavalkya.
`And what are these three?'
`Those which are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Puronuvakya, Yagya, and,
thirdly, Sasya.'
`What does he gain by them?'
`All whatsoever has breath.'
3-1:8. `Yagnavalkya,' he said, `how many oblations
(ahuti) will the Adhvaryu priest employ to-day at this
sacrifice?'
`Three,' replied Yagnavalkya.
`And what are these three?'
`Those which, when offered, flame up; those which, when
offered, make an excessive noise; and those
which, when offered, sink down.'`What does he gain by
them?'
`By those which, when offered, flame up, he gains the
Deva (god) world, for the Deva <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> flames up, as

below.'
3-1:9. `Yagnavalkya,' he said, `with how many deities
does the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> priest on the right protect to-day

`By one,' replied Yagnavalkya.
`And which is it?'
`The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> alone; for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> is endless, and the
Visvedevas are endless, and he thereby gains the
endless
world.'
3-1:10. `Yagnavalkya,' he said, `how many Stotriya
hymns will the Udgatri priest employ to-day at this
sacrifice?'
`Three,' replied Yagnavalkya.
`And what are these three?'
`Those which are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Puronuvakya, Yagya, and,

`And what are these with regard to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span>

`The Puronuvakya is Prana (up-breathing), the Yagya the
Apana (down-breathing), the Sasya the Vyana
(back-breathing).'
`What does he gain by them?'
`He gains the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> by the Puronuvakya, the sky by the

After that Asvala held his peace.

3-2:1. Then Garatkarava Artabhaga asked.
`Yagnavalkya,' he said, `how many Grahas are there, and
how many Atigrahas?'
`Eight Grahas,' he replied, `and eight Atigrahas.'
`And what are these eight Grahas and eight Atigrahas?'
3-2:2. `Prana (breath) is one Graha, and that is seized by
Apana (down-breathing) as the Atigraha, for
one smells with the Apana.'
3-2:3. `Speech (vak) is one Graha, and that is seized by
name (naman) as the Atigraha, for with speech
one pronounces names.'
3-2:4. `The tongue is one Graha, and that is seized by
taste as the Atigraha, for with the tongue one
perceives tastes.'
3-2:5. `The eye is one Graha, and that is seized by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span>

3-2:6. `The ear is one Graha, and that is seized by sound
as the Atigraha, for with the ear one hears
sounds.'
3-2:7. `The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> is one Graha, and that is seized by

3-2:8. `The arms are one Graha, and these are seized by

3-2:9. `The skin is one Graha, and that is seized by touch
as the Atigraha, for with the skin one perceives
touch. These are the eight Grahas and the eight
Atigrahas.'
3-2:10. `Yagnavalkya,' he said, `everything is the <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> of
death. What then is the deity to whom <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">death</span> is

`Fire (agni) is death, and that is the <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> of water. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Death</span>

3-2:11. `Yagnavalkya,' he said, `when such a <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> (a
sage) dies, do the vital breaths (pranas) move out
of him or no?'
`No,' replied Yagnavalkya; `they are gathered up in him,
he swells, he is inflated, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> inflated the

3-2:12. `Yagnavalkya,' he said, `when such a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> dies,
what does not leave him?'
`The name,' he replied; `for the name is endless, the
Visvedevas are endless, and by it he gains the endless
world.'
3-2:13. `Yagnavalkya,' he said, `when the speech of this
dead <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> enters into the fire, breath into the
air, the eye into the sun, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> into the moon, the

said, `we wandered about as students, and came

Sudhanvan, the Angirasa.' And when we asked

him about the ends of the world, we said to him, `Where
were the Parikshitas? Where then were the
Parikshitas, I ask thee, Yagnavalkya, where were the
Parikshitas?'
3-3:2. Yagnavalkya said: `He said to thee, I suppose,
that they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> where those go who have performed

He said: `And where do they go who have performed a

unheard, but hearing; unperceived, but

sees but it, nothing that hears but it, nothing

He asked: `Who are those thirty-three?'
Yagnavalkya replied: `The eight Vasus, the eleven
Rudras, the twelve Adityas. They make thirty-one, and
Indra and Pragapati make the thirty-three.'

Yagnavalkya replied: `Agni (fire), Prithivi (earth), Vayu

3-9:27. Then Yagnavalkya said: `Reverend Brahmanas,
whosoever among you desires to do so, may now
question me. Or question me, all of you. Or whosoever
among you desires it, I shall question him, or I
shall question all of you.
But those Brahmanas durst not (say anything).
3-9:28. Then Yagnavalkya questioned them with these
Slokas:
1. `As a mighty tree in the forest, so in <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> is man, his
hairs are the leaves, his outer skin is the bark.

2. `From his skin flows forth blood, sap from the skin (of
the tree); and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> from the wounded <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span>
comes forth blood, as from a tree that is struck.
3. `The lumps of his <span class="t21 hoverable">flesh</span> are (in the tree) the layers of
wood, the fibre is strong like the tendons. The
bones are the (hard) wood within, the marrow is made like
the marrow of the tree.
4. `But, while the tree, when felled, grows up again more
young from the root, from what root, tell me,
does a mortal grow up, after he has been felled by death?
5. `Do not say, "from seed," for seed is produced from
the living; but a tree, springing from a grain,
clearly rises again after death.
6. `If a tree is pulled up with the root, it will not grow
again; from what root then, tell me, does a mortal
grow up, after he has been felled by death?
7. `Once born, he is not <span class="t16 t24 hoverable">born</span> (again); for who should
create him again?'
`Brahman, who is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> and bliss, he is the

audience), Yagnavalkya approached, and Ganaka
Vaideha said: `Yagnavalkya, for what <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> did you
come, wishing for cattle, or for subtle questions?'
Yagnavalkya replied: `For both, Your Majesty;

4-1:2. `Let us hear what anybody may have told you.'
Ganaka Vaideha replied: `Gitvan Sailini told me
that speech (vak) is Brahman.'
Yagnavalkya said: `As one who had (the benefit of a

Sailini tell you, that speech is Brahman; for what is the

Yagnavalkya said: `Your Majesty, this (Brahman) stands

Ganaka Vaideha said: `Then tell me, Yagnavalkya.'
Yagnavalkya said: `The tongue is its body, ether its place,

Yagnavalkya replied: `Your Majesty, speech itself (is

the Itihasa (tradition), Purana-vidya (knowledge of the

Yagnavalkya said: `Your Majesty, this (Brahman) stands

Ganaka Vaideha said: `Then tell me, Yagnavalkya.'
Yagnavalkya said: `The ear is its body, ether its place,

4-3:7. Ganaka Vaideha said: `Who is that Self?'
Yagnavalkya replied: `He who is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the heart,
surrounded by the Pranas (senses), the <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> of light,

wanders along the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> worlds, as if thinking, as if

the sway of death, all that is perishable).
4-3:8. `On being <span class="t16 t24 hoverable">born</span> that person, assuming his body,
becomes united with all evils; when he departs and
dies, he leaves all evils behind.
4-3:9. `And there are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> states for that person, the one

and as a <span class="t7 hoverable">third</span> an intermediate state, the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of sleep.
When in that intermediate state, he sees both those
states together, the one here in this world, and the other
in the other world. Now whatever his admission

`And when he falls asleep, then after having <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> away

4-3:10. `There are no (real) chariots in that state, no
horses, no roads, but he himself sends forth (creates)
chariots, horses, and roads. There are no blessings
there, no happiness, no joys, but he himself sends forth
(creates) blessings, happiness, and joys. There are no
tanks there, no lakes, no rivers, but he himself
sends forth (creates) tanks, lakes, and rivers. He indeed
is the maker.
4-3:11. `On this there are these verses:
`After having subdued by sleep all that belongs to the

to his place, the golden person, the lonely bird.
(1)
4-3:12. `Guarding with the breath (prana, life) the lower
nest, the immortal moves away from the nest;
that immortal one goes wherever he likes, the golden
person, the lonely bird. (2)
4-3:13. `Going up and down in his dream, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">god</span> makes

`Here some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> (object and) say: "No, this (sleep) is

Then Yagnavalkya was afraid lest the King, having

Section 4
Fourth Brahmana
4-4:1. Yagnavalkya continued: `Now when that Self,
having sunk into weakness, sinks, as it were, into
unconsciousness, then gather those senses (pranas)
around him, and he, taking with him those elements of
light, descends into the heart. When that <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> in the
eye turns away, then he ceases to know any forms.
4-4:2. `"He has become one," they say, "he does not
see." "He has become one," they say, "he does not
smell." "He has become one," they say, "he does not
does not taste." "He has become one," they say, "he
does not speak." "He has become one," they say, "he
does not hear." "He has become one," they say, "he
does not think." "He has become one," they say, "he
does not touch." "He has become one," they say, "he
does not know." The point of his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> becomes lighted

423

through the eye, or through the skull, or through other
places of the body.

(the chief prana) departs after him, and when <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span>
departs, all the other vital spirits (pranas) depart
after it. He is conscious, and being conscious he follows
and departs.
`Then both his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> and his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> hold of him,
and his acquaintance with former things.'
4-4:3. `And as a caterpillar, after having reached the end
of a blade of grass, and after having made
another approach (to another blade), draws itself <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span>
towards it, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> does this Self, after having
thrown off this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> and dispelled all ignorance, and after
making another approach (to another body),
draw himself <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> towards it.
4-4:4. `And as a goldsmith, taking a piece of gold, turns it
into another, newer and more beautiful shape,
so does this Self, after having thrown off this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> and
dispelled all ignorance, make <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">unto</span> himself
another, newer and more beautiful shape, <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> it be
like the Fathers, or like the Gandharvas, or like
the Devas, or like Pragapati, or like Brahman, or like other
beings.
4-4:5. `That Self is indeed Brahman, consisting of
knowledge, mind, life, sight, hearing, earth, water,
wind, ether, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> and no light, <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> and no desire, anger
and no anger, right or wrong, and all things.
Now as a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> is like this or like that, according as he acts
and according as he behaves, so will he be:

bad. He becomes pure by pure deeds, bad by bad
deeds.
`And here they say that a <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> consists of desires. And
as is his desire, so is his will; and as is his will,
so is his deed; and whatever deed he does, that he will
reap.
4-4:6. `And here there is this verse: "To whatever <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span>
a man's own <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> is attached, to that he goes

the end (the last results) of whatever deed he does
424

here on earth, he returns again from that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> (which is

of action."
`So much for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> who desires.

who does not desire, who, not desiring, freed from
desires, is satisfied in his desires, or desires the Self only,
his vital spirits do not depart elsewhere,
being Brahman, he goes to Brahman.
4-4:7. `On this there is this verse: "When all desires

`And as the slough of a snake lies on an ant-hill, dead

Ganaka Vaideha said: `Sir, I give you a thousand.'
4-4:8. `On this there are these verses:
`The small, old path stretching far away has been found
by me. On it sages who know <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> move on

4-4:9. `On that path they say that there is white, or blue,
or yellow, or green, or red; that path was found

no! He is incomprehensible, for he cannot be

4-4:24. This indeed is the great, the unborn Self, the
strong, the giver of wealth. He who knows this

immortal, fearless, is indeed Brahman. Fearless is
Brahman, and he who knows this becomes verily the

But he replied: `O Maitreyi, I say nothing that is
bewildering. Verily, beloved, that Self is imperishable,

4-5:15. `For when there is as it were duality, then one
sees the other, one smells the other, one tastes the

perceives the other, one touches the other, one knows
the other; but when the Self only is all this, how should he
see another, how should he smell another, how
should he taste another, how should he salute another,
how should he hear another, how should he touch
another, how should he know another? How should he
know Him by whom he knows all this? That Self
is to be described by No, no! He is incomprehensible, for
he cannot be comprehended; he is imperishable,
for he cannot perish; he is unattached, for he does not
attach himself; unfettered, he does not suffer, he
does not fail. How, O beloved, should he know the
Knower? Thus, O Maitreyi, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thou</span> <span class="t0 t6 t12 t13 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">hast</span> been instructed.

5-13:4. Next follows the Kshatra. Verily, breath is the
Kshatra, for breath is Kshatra, i.e. breath protects

this, obtains Kshatra (power), which requires
no protection; he obtains union and oneness with

First Brahmana
6-1:1. Harih, Om. He who knows the first and the best,
becomes himself the first and the best among his
people. Breath is indeed the first and the best. He who
knows this, becomes the first and the best among
his people, and among whomsoever he wishes to be so.
6-1:2. He who knows the richest, becomes himself the
richest among his people. Speech is the richest.
442

He who knows this, becomes the richest among his
people, and among whomsoever he wishes to be so.
6-1:3. He who knows the firm rest, becomes himself firm
on even and uneven ground. The eye indeed is
the firm rest, for by means of the eye a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> stands firm
on even and uneven ground. He who knows this,
stands firm on even and uneven ground.
6-1:4. He who knows success, whatever <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> he
desires, it succeeds to him. The ear indeed is success.
For in the ear are all these Vedas successful. He who
knows this, whatever <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> he desires, it succeeds
to him.
6-1:5. He who knows the home, becomes a home of his
own people, a home of all men. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> indeed

6-1:6. He who knows generation, becomes rich in
offspring and cattle. Seed indeed is generation. He
who knows this, becomes rich in offspring and cattle.
6-1:7. These Pranas (senses), when quarrelling <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span>

6-1:8. The tongue (speech) departed, and having been
absent for a year, it came back and said: `How

Then the seed entered in.
6-1:13. The (vital) breath, when on the point of departing,
tore up these senses, as a great, excellent horse
of the Sindhu country might tare up the pegs to which he
is tethered. They said to him: `Sir, do not
depart. We shall not be able to live <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> thee.' He
said: `Then make me an offering.' They said: `Let

6-4:24. When the child is born, he prepares the fire,
places the child on his lap, and having poured
prishadagya, i.e. dadhi (thick milk) mixed with ghrita
(clarified butter) into a metal jug, he sacrifices bit
by bit of that prishadagya, saying: `May I, as I increase in
this my house, nourish a thousand! May
fortune never fail in his race, with offspring and cattle,
Svaha!'
`I offer to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thee</span> in my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> the vital breaths which are in

6-4:25. Then putting his mouth near the child's right ear,
he says thrice, Speech, speech! After that he
pours <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> thick milk, honey, and clarified butter, and
feeds the child with (a ladle of) pure gold,
saying: `I give <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thee</span> Bhuh, I give <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thee</span> Bhuvah, I give <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thee</span>

6-4:26. Then he gives him his name, saying: `Thou <span class="t2 t6 t8 t9 t10 t15 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">art</span>
Veda;' but this is his secret name.
6-4:27. Then he <span class="t13 t23 hoverable">hands</span> the boy to his mother and gives
him her breast, saying: `O Sarasvati, that breast of

And they say of such a boy: `Ah, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thou</span> <span class="t2 t6 t8 t9 t10 t15 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">art</span> better than <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thy</span>

1:1. The Brahma-students say: Is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> the cause?
Whence are we born? Whereby do we live, and
whither do we go? O ye who know Brahman, (tell us) at
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> command we abide, <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> in pain or in
pleasure?
1:2. Should time, or nature, or necessity, or chance, or
the elements be considered as the cause, or he who
is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> (purusha, vignanatma)? It cannot be
their union either, because that is not selfdependent, and the self also is powerless, because there
is (independent of him) a cause of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> and evil.
1:3. The sages, devoted to <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> and concentration,
have seen the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> belonging to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> himself,
hidden in its own qualities (guna). He, being one,
superintends all those causes, time, self, and the rest.

1:5. We meditate on the river <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> consists of the
five streams, which is wild and winding with its
five springs, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> waves are the five vital breaths,

five kinds of perceptions. It has five whirlpools, its rapids
are the five pains; it has fifty kinds of suffering,
and five branches.
1:6. In that vast Brahma-wheel, in which all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> live
and rest, the bird flutters about, so <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> as he
thinks that the self (in him) is different from the mover (the
god, the lord). When he has been <span class="t11 hoverable">blessed</span> by
him, then he gains immortality.
1:7. But what is praised (in the Upanishads) is the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">Highest</span> Brahman, and in it there is the triad. The

The Brahma-students, when they have known
what is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> this (world), are devoted and merged in the
Brahman, <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> from birth.
1:8. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> (isa) supports all this together, the
perishable and the imperishable, the developed and the
undeveloped. The (living) self, not being a lord, is bound,
because he has to enjoy (the fruits of works);
but when he has known the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">god</span> (deva), he is freed from
all fetters.
1:9. There are two, one knowing (isvara), the other notknowing (giva), both unborn, one strong, the
other weak; there is she, the unborn, through whom each
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> receives the recompense of his works; and
there is the infinite Self (appearing) under all forms, but
himself inactive. When a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> finds out these
three, that is Brahma.
1:10. That which is perishable is the Pradhana (the first),
the immortal and imperishable is Hara. The
one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">god</span> rules the perishable (the pradhana) and the
(living) self. From meditating on him, from joining
him, from becoming one with him there is further

clarified butter, alone enveloping everything, he who
knows the god, is freed from all fetters.

wherein the two, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> and ignorance, are

5:2. It is he who, being one only, rules over every germ
(cause), over all forms, and over all germs; it is
he who, in the beginning, bears in his thoughts the <span class="t8 t12 t17 hoverable">wise</span>
son, the fiery, whom he wishes to look on while
he is born.
5:3. In that field in which the god, after spreading out one
net after another in various ways, draws it

5:4. As the car (of the sun) shines, lighting up all
quarters, above, below, and across, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> does that god,

5:5. He, being one, rules over all and everything, so that
the universal germ ripens its nature, diversifies
all natures that can be ripened, and determines all
qualities.
5:6. Brahma (Hiranyagarbha) knows this, which is hidden
in the Upanishads, which are hidden in the
Vedas, as the Brahma-germ. The ancient <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> and
poets who knew it, they became it and were immortal.

5:8. That lower one also, not larger than a thumb, but
brilliant like the sun, who is endowed with
personality and thoughts, with the quality of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> and the

5:11. By means of thoughts, touching, seeing, and
passions the incarnate Self assumes successively in
various places various forms, in accordance with his
deeds, just as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> grows when <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> and drink
are poured into it.
5:12. That incarnate Self, according to his own qualities,
chooses (assumes) many shapes, coarse or
subtile, and having himself caused his union with them,
he is seen as another and another, through the
471

qualities of his acts, and through the qualities of his body.
5:13. He who knows him who has no beginning and no
end, in the midst of chaos, creating all things,
having many forms, alone enveloping everything, is freed
from all fetters.
5:14. Those who know him who is to be grasped by the
mind, who is not to be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the nest (the body),

Commentary
6:4. Note: These <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> verses are again extremely
obscure, and the explanations of the commentators throw
little <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> on the their real, original meaning. To begin
with Sankara, he assumes the subject to be the
same as he at <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> command this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> unfolds itself,
and explains tattvasya tattvena sametya yogam by
atmano bhumyadina yogam samgamayya. As the eight
Tattvas he gives earth, water, fire, air, ether,
mind, thought, personality, while the Atmagunas are,
according to him, the affections of the mind, love,
anger, &c. In the <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> verse, however, Sankara
seems to assume a different subject. `If a man,' he says,
`having done works, infected by qualities, should transfer
them on Isvara, the Lord, there <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be
destruction of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> formerly done by him, because
there <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be no more connection with the self.'
Something is <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> out, but that this is Sankara's idea,
appears from the verses which he quotes in support,
and which are intended to show that Yogins, transfering
all their acts, good, bad, or indifferent, on
Brahman, are no longer affected by them. `That person,'
Sankara continues, `his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> being destroyed
and his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> purified, moves on, different from all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span>
(tattva), from all the results of ignorance,
knowing himself to be Brahman.' `Or,' he adds, `if we
read anyad, it means, he goes to that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span>
which is differen from all things.'
Sankarananda takes a different view. He says: `If a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span>
has performed sacrifices, and has finished them,
or, has turned away from them again as vain, and if he
has obtained union with that which is the real of
the (apparently) real, &c.' The commentator then asks
what is that with which he obtains union, and
replies, `the one, i.e. ignorance; the two, i.e. right and
wrong; the three, i.e. the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> colours, red white,
and black; and the eight, i.e. the five elements, with mind,
thought, and personality; also with time, and
with the subtile affections of the mind.' He then goes on,
`If that man, after having begun qualified
475

works, should <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> on himself all states (resulting from
ignorance), yet, when these states cease, there
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be an end of the work, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> or bad, done by him,
and when his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> has come to an end, he abides
in <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> (according to the Veda); while the other, who
differs from the Veda, is wrong.' Sankarananda,
however, evidently feels that this is a doubtful
interpretation, and he suggests another, viz. `If the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span>
himself,' he says, `determined these states (bhava), it
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> seem that there <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be no end of samsara.
He <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> says, that when these states, ignorance &c.,
cease, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> done by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> ceases; and when
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> done ceases, the living <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> gets <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> of

ignorance and its products.'
Vignanatman says: `If a man, having done work, turns
away from it, and obtains union of one tattva (the
tvam, or self) with the real tatta (the tat, or the Lord); and
how? By means of the one, i.e. the teaching
of the Guru; the two, i.e. <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t8 t13 t15 t17 t18 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> of the Guru and of the Lord;
the three, i.e. hearing remembering, and
meditating; the eight, i.e. restraint, penance, postures,
regulation of the breath, abstraction, devotion,
contemplation, and <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> (Yoga-sutras II, 29); by
time, i.e. the right <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> for work; by the qualities
of the self, i.e. pity, &c.; by the subtile ones, i.e. the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span>
dispositions for knowledge, then (we must
supply) he becomes free.' And this he explains more fully
in the next verse. `If, after having done
qualified works, i.e. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> to please the Lord, a Yati
discards all things, and recognises the phenomenal
character of all states, and traces them back to their real
source, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> done ceases also in its effects,
and when the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> has been annihilated, he goes to
freedom, being another in truth; or, if we read anyat,
he goes to what is different from all these things, namely,
to the Lord; or, he goes to a <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of perfect
lordship in truth, having discovered the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> truth, the
oneness of the self with the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">Highest</span> Self.'
I think that, judging from the context, the subject is really
the same in both verses, viz. the Lord, as
passing through different states, and at last knowing
himself to be above them all. Yet, the other
476

explanations may be defended, and if the subject were
<span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> to be different in each verse, some difficulties
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> disappear.

First Question
Adoration to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">Highest</span> Self! Harih, Om!
1:1. Sukesas Bharadvaga, and Saivya Satyakama, and
Sauryayanin Gargya, and Kausalya Asvalayana,
and Bhargava Vaidarbhi, and Kabandhin Katyayana,
these were devoted to Brahman, firm in Brahman,
seeking for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">Highest</span> Brahman. They <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> that the
venerable Pippalada could tell them all that, and
they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> fuel in their <span class="t13 t23 hoverable">hands</span> (like pupils), and
approached him.
1:2. That Rishi said to them: `Stay here a year longer,
with penance, abstinence, and faith; then you may
ask questions according to your pleasure, and if we know
them, we shall tell you all.'
1:3. Then Kabandhin Katyayana approached him and
asked: `Sir, from whence may these creatures be
born?'
1:4. He replied: `Pragapati (the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">lord</span> of creatures) was
desirous of creatures (pragah). He performed
penance, and having performed penance, he produces a
pair, <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> (rayi) and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> (prana), thinking that
they <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> should produce creatures for him in many
ways.
1:5. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> is spirit, <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> is the moon. All this, what
has <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> and what has no body, is matter, and
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> indeed is matter.

1:6. Now Aditya, the sun, when he rises, goes toward the
East, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> receives the Eastern spirits into
his rays. And when he illuminates the South, the West,
the North, the Zenith, the Nadir, the intermediate
quarters, and everything, he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> receives all spirits into
his rays.
1:7. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> he rises, as Vaisvanara, (belonging to all men,)
assuming all forms, as spirit, as fire. This has
been said in the following verse:
1:8. (They knew) him who assumes all forms, the golden,
who knows all things, who ascends highest,
alone in his splendour, and warms us; the thousandrayed, who abides in a hundred places, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> of all
creatures, the Sun, rises.
1:9. The year indeed is Pragapati, and there are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span>
paths thereof, the Southern and the Northern. Now
those who here believe in sacrifices and pious gifts as
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> done, gain the moon only as their (future)
world, and return again. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Therefore</span> the Rishis who <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span>
offspring, go to the South, and that path of the
Fathers is <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> (rayi).
1:10. But those who have sought the Self by penance,
abstinence, faith, and knowledge, gain by the
Northern path Aditya, the sun. This is the home of the
spirits, the immortal, <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> from danger, the
highest. From thence they do not return, for it is the end.
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> says the Sloka:
1:11. Some <span class="t3 t11 t18 t27 hoverable">call</span> him the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">father</span> with five feet (the five
seasons), and with twelve shapes (the twelve
months), the giver of rain in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> half of heaven;
others again say that the sage is placed in the
lower half, in the chariot with seven wheels and six
spokes.
1:12. The month is Pragapati; its dark half is matter, its
bright half spirit. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Therefore</span> some Rishis perform
<span class="t2 t9 t10 t16 t18 t19 t27 t28 hoverable">sacrifice</span> in the bright half, others in the other half.
1:13. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Day</span> and Night are Pragapati; its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> is spirit, its
night matter. Those who unite in <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t8 t13 t15 t17 t18 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span>

waste their spirit, but to unite in <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t8 t13 t15 t17 t18 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> by night is right.
1:14. <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">Food</span> is Pragapati. Hence proceeds seed, and
from it these creatures are born.
1:15. Those <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> who observe this rule of Pragapati
(as laid down in {verse} 13), produce a pair, and
to them belongs this Brahma-world here. But those in
whom dwell penance, abstinence, and truth,
1:16. To them belongs that pure Brahma-world, to them,
namely, in whom there is nothing crooked,
nothing false, and no guile.'

<span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">Second</span> Question
2:1. Then Bhargava Vaidarbhi asked him: `Sir, How

many manifest this, and who is the best of them?'
2:2. He replied: `The ether is that god, the wind, fire,
water, earth, speech, mind, eye, and ear. These,
when they have manifested (their power), contend and
say: We (each of us) support this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> and keep it.
2:3. Then Prana (breath, spirit, life), as the best, said to
them: Be not deceived, I alone, dividing myself
fivefold, support this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> and keep it.
2:4. They were incredulous; so he, from pride, did as if
he were going out from above. Thereupon, as he

2:6. As spokes in the nave of a wheel, everything is fixed
in Prana, the verses of the Rig-veda, Yagurveda, Sama-veda, the sacrifice, the Kshatriyas, and the
Brahmans.
2:7. As Pragapati (lord of creatures) <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thou</span> movest about

3:1. Then Kausalya Asvalayana asked: `Sir, whence is
that Prana (spirit) born? How does it come into

itself? How does it go out? How does it support

3:2. He replied: `You ask questions more difficult, but you

Hiranyanabha, the prince of Kosala, came to me
and asked this question: Do you know the <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> of
sixteen parts, O Bharadvaga? I said to the prince: I
do not know him; if I knew him, how should I not tell you?
Surely, he who speaks what is untrue withers
away to the very root; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> I will not say what is
untrue. Then he mounted his chariot and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> away
silently. Now I ask you, where is that person?'
6:2. He replied: `Friend, that <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> is here <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the
body, he in whom these sixteen parts arise.
6:3. He reflected: What is it by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> departure I shall
depart, and by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> staying I shall stay?
6:4. He sent forth (created) Prana (spirit); from Prana
Sraddha (faith), ether, air, light, water, earth,
sense, mind, food; from <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> came vigour, penance,
hymns, sacrifice, the worlds, and in the worlds the
name also.
6:5. As these flowing rivers that go towards the ocean,
when they have reached the ocean, sink into it,
their name and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> are broken, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> <span class="t9 t11 t20 t21 t22 t23 t27 hoverable">speak</span> of the
ocean only, exactly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> these sixteen parts of the
spectator that go towards the <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> (purusha), when
they have reached the person, sink into him, their
name and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> are broken, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> <span class="t9 t11 t20 t21 t22 t23 t27 hoverable">speak</span> of the
<span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> only, and he becomes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> parts and
immortal. On this there is this verse:
6:6. That <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> who is to be known, he in whom these
parts rest, like spokes in the nave of a wheel, you
know him, lest <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">death</span> should hurt you.'
6:7. Then he (Pippalada) said to them: `So far do I know
this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">Highest</span> Brahman, there is nothing <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span>
than it.'
485

6:8. And they praising him, said: `You, indeed, are our
father, you who carry us from our ignorance to
the other shore.'
Adoration to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Rishis!

First Prapathaka
Section 1
The laying of the formerly-described sacrificial fires is
indeed the <span class="t2 t9 t10 t16 t18 t19 t27 t28 hoverable">sacrifice</span> of Brahman. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Therefore</span> let the
sacrificer, after he has laid those fires, meditate on the
Self. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> only does the sacrificer become
complete and faultless.
But who is to be meditated on? He who is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Prana
(breath). Of him there is this story:
Section 2
A King, named Brihadratha, having established his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> in
his sovereignty, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> into the forest, because
he considered this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> as transient, and had obtained
freedom from all desires. Having performed the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> penance, he stands there, with uplifted arms,
looking up to the sun. At the end of a <span class="t15 t23 hoverable">thousand</span>
(days), the Saint Sakayanya, who knew the Self, came
near, burning with splendour, like a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span>
smoke. He said to the King: `Rise, rise! Choose a boon!'
486

The King, bowing before him, said: `O Saint, I know not
the Self, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thou</span> knowest the essence (of the Self).
We have <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> so. Teach it us.'
Sakayanya replied: `This was achieved of yore; but what
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thou</span> askest is difficult to obtain. O Aikshvaka,
choose other pleasures.'
The King, touching the Saint's feet with his head, recited
this Gatha:
Section 3
`O Saint, What is the <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> of the enjoyment of pleasures in
this offensive, pithless <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> a mere mass of
bones, skin, sinews, marrow, flesh, seed, blood, mucus,
tears, phlegm, ordure, water, bile, and slime!
What is the <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> of the enjoyment of pleasures in this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span>
which is assailed by lust, hatred, greed,
delusion, fear, anguish, jealousy, separation from what is
loved, union with what is not loved, hunger,
thirst, old age, death, illness, grief, and other evils!
Section 4
And we see that all this is perishable, as these flies,
gnats, and other insects, as herbs and trees, growing
and decaying. And what of these? There are other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>

Hariskandra, Ambarisha, Nahusha, Ananata, Saryati,
Yayati, Anaranya, Ukshasena, &c., and kings such

We see the destruction of Gandharvas, Asuras, Yakshas,
Rakshasas, Bhutas, Ganas, Pisakas, snakes, and
vampires. And what of these? There is the drying up of
other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> oceans, the falling of mountains, the

Then the Saint said to him:

`Now then this is the science of Brahman, and the

by the Saint Maitri. I shall tell it to thee:

said:

`He who in the Sruti is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> "Standing above," like

They said: `O Saint, How has this been made intelligent
by such a being as this which has no desires, and
how is he its driver?' He answered them and said:

They said to him: `O Saint, if this has been made
intelligent by such a being as this, which has no desires,
and if he is the driver thereof, how was it?' He answered
them and said:
Section 6
`In the beginning Pragapati (the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">lord</span> of creatures) stood
alone. He had no happiness, when alone.
489

Meditating on himself, he <span class="t16 hoverable">created</span> many creatures. He
looked on them and saw they were, like a stone,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> understanding, and standing like a lifeless post.
He had no happiness. He thought, I shall enter
within, that they may awake. Making himself like air
(vayu) he entered within. Being one, he could not
do it. Then dividing himself fivefold, he is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Prana,
Apana, Samana, Udana, Vyana. Now that air
which rises upwards, is Prana. That which moves
downwards, is Apana. That by which these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> are
supposed to be held, is Vyana. That which carries the
grosser material of <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> to the Apana, and brings
the subtler material to each limb, has the name Samana.
[After these (Prana, Apana, Samana) comes the

and Samana on one <span class="t6 hoverable">side</span> and the Vyana on the
other) comes the rising of the Udana.] That which brings
up or carries down what has been drunk and
eaten, is the Udana.
Now the Upamsu-vessel (or prana) depends on the
Antaryama-vessel (apana) and the Antaryama-vessel
(apana) on the Upamsu-vessel (prana), and between
these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> the self-resplendent (Self) produced heat.
This heat is the purusha (person), and this purusha is

that is eaten is cooked, i.e. digested. Its noise
is that which one hears, if one covers one's ears. When a

does not hear that noise."
Now he, having divided himself fivefold, is hidden in a
secret <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> (buddhi), assuming the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of

objects." Therefore, having first broken open these five
apertures (of the senses), he enjoys the objects by
means of the five reins. This means that these perceptive
organs (ear, skin, eye, tongue, nose) are his
reins; the active organs (tongue (for speaking), hands,
feet, anus, generative organ) his horses; the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span>

This is indeed the Self, who seeming to be filled with

Section 2
Pragapati Kratu replied: `There is indeed that other
different one, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the elemental Self (Bhutatma),

his course, and overcome by the pairs he roams about.
And this is his explanation: The five Tanmatras
(sound, touch, form, taste, smell) are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Bhuta; also

dwelt in the body, he is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Bhutatma, the elemental

qualities, darkened in his imaginations, unstable,
fickle, crippled, <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span> of desires, vacillating, he enters into
belief, believing "I am he," "this is mine;" he
binds his Self by his Self, as a bird with a net, and
overcome afterwards by the fruits of what he has done,
he enters on a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> and bad birth; downward or upward
is his course, and overcome by the pairs he roams

They asked: `Which is it?' And he answered them:

`This also has elsewhere been said: He who acts, is the

even a ball of iron, pervaded (overcome) by fire, and

and many impurities besides, like a treasury
<span class="t5 hoverable">full</span> of treasures.
Section 5
And it has been said elsewhere: Bewilderment, fear, grief,
sleep, sloth, carelessness, decay, sorrow,
hunger, thirst, niggardliness, wrath, infidelity, ignorance,
envy, cruelty, folly, shamelessness, meanness,
pride, changeability, these are the results of the quality of
darkness (tamah).
Inward thirst, fondness, passion, covetousness,
unkindness, love, hatred, deceit, jealousy, vain
restlessness, fickleness, unstableness, emulation, greed,
patronising of friends, family pride, aversion to
disagreeable objects, devotion to agreeable objects,
whispering, prodigality, these are the results of the
quality of passion (ragas).
By these he is filled, by these he is overcome, and

Svaha to Prana, Svaha to Apana, Svaha to Vyana, Svaha

Section 10
There is something else to be known. There is a further
modification of this Self-sacrifice (the eating),
namely, the <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> and the eater thereof. This is the
explanation. The thinking Purusha (person), when he
abides <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the Pradhana (nature), is the feeder who
feeds on the <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> supplied by Prakriti (nature).
The elemental Self is truly his food, his maker being
Pradhana (nature). <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Therefore</span> what is composed of
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> qualities (gunas) is the food, but the <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span>
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> is the feeder. And for this the evidence is
supplied by the senses. For animals spring from seed,
and as the seed is the food, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> it is clear that
what is <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> is Pradhana (the seed or cause of
everything). Therefore, as has been said, the Purusha
(person) is the eater, Prakriti, the food; and abiding <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span>
it he feeds. All that begins with the Mahat
(power of intellect) and ends with the Viseshas
(elements), being developed from the distinction of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span>
with its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> qualities, is the sign (that there must be a
Purusha, an intelligent subject). And in this
manner the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> with its fourteen steps has been
explained. (This is comprehended in the following

there is no laying hold of the taste of the seed (cause), so
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> as there is no development (in the shape of

of food, as childhood, youth, and old age; for,
because these are developed, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> there is in them
the character of food.
And in the following manner does the perception of
Pradhana (nature) <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> place, after it has become
manifest: Intellect and the rest, such as determination,
conception, consciousness, are for the tasting (of
the effects of Pradhana). Then there are the five
(perceptive organs) intended for the (five) objects of
senses, for to taste them. And <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> are all acts of the five
active organs, and the acts of the five Pranas or
vital airs (for the tasting of their corresponding objects).
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> what is manifest (of nature) is food, and
what is not manifest is food. The enjoyer of it is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span>

an enjoyer, it follows that he possesses intelligence.
As <span class="t4 t6 t9 t10 t12 t14 t17 t18 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">Agni</span> (fire) is the food-eater among the gods, and
Soma the food, so he who knows this eats <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> by
<span class="t4 t6 t9 t10 t12 t14 t17 t18 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">Agni</span> (is not defiled by food, as little as Agni, the sacrificial

no one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> touch women intruding into an empty

`There are endless rays (arteries) for the Self who, like a
lamp, dwells in the heart: white and black, brown

and blue, tawny and reddish.
One of them (the Sushumna) leads upwards, piercing the
solar orb: by it, having stepped beyond the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span>

The other hundred rays rise upwards also, and on them
the worshipper reaches the mansions belonging to
the different bodies of gods.

downwards, by them a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> travels on and on helplessly,

Section 31
Some one asks: `Of what <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> are those organs of
<span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> that go forth (towards their objects)? Who
sends them out here, or who holds them back?'
Another answers: `Their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> is the Self; the Self sends
them out, or holds them back; also the Apsaras
(enticing objects of sense), and the solar rays (and other
deities presiding over the senses).'
Now the Self devours the objects by the five rays (the
organs of sense); then who is the Self?
He who has been defined by the terms pure, clean,
undeveloped, tranquil, &c., who is to be apprehended
independently by his own peculiar signs. That sign of him
who has no signs, is like what the pervading
heat is of fire, the purest taste of water; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> say some. It

Self in the same <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> in which here on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> shoots are
the signs of seed, or smoke, light, and sparks of
fire. And for this they quote:
514

`As the sparks from the fire, and as the rays from the sun,

`The gold-coloured bird abides in the heart, and in the

having there broken through the (four) spheres of
the Sun, the Moon, the Fire, and Goodness, he then,
being purified himself, beholds dwelling in goodness,
immovable, immortal, indestructible, firm, bearing the

(4) The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> excites the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> of the body, that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> stirs the
breath, and the breath, moving in the chest,
produces the low sound.

churning-stick, it is at first a minim, from the minim
it becomes in the throat a double minim; on the tip of the
tongue know that it is a treble minim, and, when
uttered, they <span class="t3 t11 t18 t27 hoverable">call</span> it the alphabet ({stoicheia [greek]}).
(6) He who sees this, does not see death, nor disease,
nor misery, for seeing he sees all (objectively, not as
affecting him subjectively); he becomes all everywhere
(he becomes Brahman).
(7) There is the <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> in the eye, there is he who walks
as in sleep, he who is sound asleep, and he who
is above the sleeper: these are the four conditions (of the
Self), and the fourth is greater than all.

It is that both the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> (in the fourth condition) and the
