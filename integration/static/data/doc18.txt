PREFACE
Tantra is a major development in the evolution of
Indian <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> inasmuch as it represents a
determined attempt at reconciling the apparent points of
conflict <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span> the <span class="t1 t2 t18 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">different</span> schools of philosophy that

synthesize the monism of the Advaita with the dualism
of the Samkhya, enrich Jnana with the rasa of Bhakti,
join <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Nature</span> to her <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> in the <span class="t9 hoverable">person</span> of the <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span>
individual, harmonize the claims of the <span class="t0 t1 t3 t5 t7 t8 t13 t16 t18 t20 t21 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">Spirit</span> with the
rights of Matter. It recovers the lost heritage of the
ancient Veda which lays emphasis <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the commonalty

of Tantra is to reject <span class="t15 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">nothing</span> that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> has created, to

is highly rational in its approach; it asks for no faith in
advance. It is a self-verifying science of the development
of natural energies into their supernatural terms leading
to a cosmic enjoyment of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> in a <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> consciousness.

asked to purify himself and told how to do it. In unambiguous terms he is told that a wine-drinker is <span class="t1 t2 t18 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">different</span>
from the drinkers of ecstasy; the union of delight is
between the ascending Sakti and the presiding <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span>

these warnings, the adepts of the Tantra <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> seem to

provides for the healthy growth of his mental faculties,
purification of his emotions and passions, orientation of
his physical faculties through ritual, japa, mantra and
upasana. Who is fit for the path of Tantra? Who is
competent to guide the novice on the double-edged razor
path? What is the responsibility of a Guru to a
disciple? These and other relevant questions are raised
and answered in a satisfying manner.

T h e Kularnava is a leading and perhaps the
foremost Tantra of the Kaula School. It enjoys
a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> reputation amongst <span class="t9 t16 t26 hoverable">works</span> of its class and

refers to animal sacrifice: and vv 67, 68 to the
necessity of wine and meat in the various forms
of worship including the Buddha. V 90 <span class="t1 t7 t9 t14 t15 t17 t25 t28 hoverable">Says</span>

defined in vv 85-86.
<span class="t12 t19 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">Chapter</span> <span class="t14 t27 hoverable">VII</span> describes worship of Vatuka,
Shakti and others. In vv. 42-44 the eight kinds
of Kula Shakti are enumerated. Vv. 70-75 are
noteworthy for they refer to the 36 Shaiva
Tattvas and not the Sangkhyan 24 thereby
denoting the connection of this Tantra with the
former philosophical Darshana. V. 96 prohibits
drinking in excess so as to produce unsteadiness
of mind. V. 99 contains the oft quoted <span class="t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">verse</span>
" D r i n k and drink a g a i n " which some erroneously suppose is an invitation to drunkenness:
notwithstanding the previous injunction and the
warning that he who disobeys it is likely to go
to Hell. T h e <span class="t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">verse</span> refers to Yoga " d r i n k i n g . "

various forms of Bliss. T h e Sadhaka passes
through these from Arambha to Praudhanta in
which state the Chakra is held to Unmana and
then to Tata. In Praudhanta everything which
is done is an offering to Bhairava (v. 59).
Unmana is the state in which the Sadhaka is no
longer affected and Tata is the very <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">self</span> of the
Supreme Mantra (vv. 83-84), T h e states up to
Praudhanta are waking (Jagrat). Unmana is

(v. 94.).
The tenth <span class="t12 t19 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">Chapter</span> treats of worship on
special <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t11 t20 t26 t27 hoverable">days</span> and the eleventh with the rules of
Kulachara which should be carefully concealed
(v. 84). The twelfth <span class="t12 t19 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">Chapter</span> treats of the Paduka
Mantra. V. 58 prohibits discussion with Atheists
or unbelievers in Veda (Nastika). The subject
of the Guru is dealt with at some length. T h e next
<span class="t12 t19 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">Chapter</span> (XIII) continues the subject of Guru
(v. 41) and disciple (vv. 1-40) and their qualifications. Amongst other defective persons, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span>

bodily centres and v. 90 gives the eight bonds
(Pasha) which bind the Pashu. The Guru is he
who by destroying the pleasures of the senses
gives Brahman-Bliss (v. 97).
<span class="t12 t19 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">Chapter</span> XIV deals with the testing (Pariksha)

various objects of desire. <span class="t12 t19 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">Chapter</span> XVII gives
the <span class="t6 t13 t14 t25 t27 hoverable">meaning</span> of a large n u m b e r of <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">words</span> such as

seventeenth <span class="t12 t19 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">Chapter</span> there is a remarkable
passage (v. 103) prohibiting (ordinary persons)
from reading the portions of this <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t7 t10 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> dealing

has been prompted by the desire that such persons should not be led astray and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">take</span> to

Kaula is the <span class="t6 t9 t22 t29 hoverable">highest</span> and the most guarded from
the profane and the unqualified. Seven are the
Ways for the liberation of man. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> is the

than anything else. These <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> orders or

In a crowning peroration of memorable

bliss issues out of this meet of the Kundali
Shakti and the Moon of Pure-Consciousness.
What flows from this Lotus in the supreme

only liquor.

and expression of the inner yoga of progression
from the h u m a n into the divine.
And of yoga, dhyana, meditation, is an

the gross and subtle kinds of Dhyana is the
