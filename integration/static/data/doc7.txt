PREFACE
THEOSOPHICAL literature, from the outset of the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> movement it inaugurated, has been largely
concerned with previously unknown laws governing
the origin and destinies of humanity, the birth
and progress of worlds, the coherent design of
the Solar System and, in short, with the
interpretation, in the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> till
recently reserved for a very few, of the
stupendous <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> purpose underlying <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span>
manifestation. My own earlier books, The Occult
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">World</span> and Esoteric Buddhism, forecast rather than
embodied teaching along such lines, revealing the
<span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> of those whom I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> "the Elder
Brethen of Humanity," who had risen above the
level of generally current civilization, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span>
had touch with the <span class="t12 t20 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">wisdom</span> of the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span>
Hierarchy. An experiment was in progress to
ascertain if ordinary culture had attained a
stage at which it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> appreciate a flood of new
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> relating to a science loftier than any
dealing exclusively with phenomena perceptible to
the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> senses, and in connection with that
experiment I was priviliged to receive a
considerable volume of information relating to
the early history of mankind millions of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span>
antedating the range of historical record; also
to the concatenation of worlds and the ultimate
destinies of our own.
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Though</span> crude and incomplete, this preliminary
sketch of occult science and of the agency
through which, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> unknown to the multitude,
the purpose of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span> was being worked out on
the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> plane, thrilled the readers of the
message all over the civilized <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> to a extent
which gave rise to an organization, the
Theosophical Society, which now covers <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Great</span>
Britain, Europe generally, and the United States
of America with innumerable branches. Fresh
teaching and information relating to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>

subjects enumerated above has meanwhile been
flowing into my hands, and much has been embodied
in my book, The Growth of the Soul; also, since
the publication of that book, in a large <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span>
of articles in reviews, pamphlets, and
"Transactions" of the London Lodge of the
Theosophical <span class="t1 hoverable">Society</span> over which I preside. The
present volume collects these scattered
contributions to our super-physical knowledge,
still growing and expanding in its scope and
value. At some later date the fundamental
principles laid down in the earlier books the
illuminating interpretation of these in the
essays now reproduced and further <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> on
mysteries previously obscure, may constitute
something resembling a complete <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span>
science. But students need not wait for this
result before assimilating the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> already
acquired. During this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> we are each of us
"imprisoned in the five senses," and, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span>
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> reaches out far beyond them, its range is
limited by the capacity of the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> brain. In
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> that capacity will expand. Ideas easily
grasped by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> of modern culture are beyond
the comprehension of the savage. The improved
intellectual mechanism of future generations will
no doubt deal freely with conceptions which
present culture cannot appreciate. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">Spiritual</span>
science, however, is an infinitude, and no
attempt to interpret it in <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> plane
language will ever be more than suggestive and
alluring.
But it is equally <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> faculty on this
plane of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> will develop as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> goes on under
the influence of effort to expand its range.
Unconsciously in most students of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span>
science <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> our reach will do more than profit
by understanding it so far. They will have
established a claim on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Nature</span> for improved
vehicles of <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> in later lives, and
will have contributed to raise the level of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span>
understanding. I am sure the experience of many

theosophists will show that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the limits of
the current <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> ideas can now be easily handled
in thought, which could not have been held in the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> during earlier periods of study. These may
still defeat the resources of <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> plane
speech, but they forecast intellectual conditions
that will ultimately outrun those resources. That
<span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> should be a stimulus to
theosophical study in whatever direction it may
tend, and few of the essays in this volume will
be found destitute of hints that will attract
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> into some new channel of spiritual, or,
at least, of super-physical enlightenment.
In no direction, as we press forward exploring
the mysteries of Nature, may we expect to attain
finality. Broad principles may be firmly
established and at first they seem to be clearly
outlined. Search for detail soon renders the
outline shadowy <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> suggesting any distrust
of the broad principle. For example, the most
fundamental teaching of Theosophy in relation to
current <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> shows us Reincarnation as
essential to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> growth of each Ego. In
one of the essays in this <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">book</span> on Theosophical
Teachings liable to be Misunderstood, so much
detail is added to the original teaching on this
subject that when we absorb this the broad idea
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> the detail seems as likely to mislead as
to instruct. Earlier statements concerning the
mechanism of the Solar System, the planetary
chains, the successive "manvantaras," etc., were
vividly significant at first. They remain as
revelations of natural <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> that we can never
lose touch with, but surrounded by the later
interpretation dealt with in some of the present
essays, concerning the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> in which the planetary
chains are concatenated <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> in
which the manvantaras expand and contract, the
first sketches of the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> are seen to fail
altogether in showing it illustrative of the
beautiful symmetry and purpose of the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span>
design. Some readers of the earlier books are too

easily satisfied. The genuine occult student will
never stand still. Henry V., preparing for battle
at Agincourt, declared that: "If it be a <span class="t0 t9 t11 t14 t17 t28 hoverable">sin</span> to
covet honour, I am the most offending <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span>
alive." And the occult student may think of
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> - the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> knowledge, the comprehension
and appreciation of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> manifesation - in the
same heroic spirit.

RELIGIOUS emotion was, till recently, at war with
science - expecially indignant with astronomy for
disturbing primitive conceptions as to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span>
this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> was first opened for business. But a
bold application of the principle that biblical
language need not be <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> at the foot of the
letter gradually enlarged its interior <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span>

The reconciliation of religion and science has
been advancing by leaps and bounds of late, and
"Seven <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Men</span> of Science," all of the foremost rank,
recently published a collection of addresses
frankly declaring their belief in God, as a
fundamental idea underlying scientific study. The
record of the old "Conflict" is now ancient
history. But this result is not a conclusion. It
is only a beginning. The seven scientific
leaders, quite in agreement as regards the main
proposition, may be groping in various directions
in the search for a definite mental picture of

admit that the reality does not lend itself to
the formation of a mental picture. Religion
reconstructed on scientific principles must build
up a conception of Divinity by working from below
upward. The earlier fashion attempted to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span>
from above downward. "In the beginning" certain

quite reasonably in dealing with young people,
ignored the idea that Eternity has no beginning.
But now that embryology must be recognized as a
method of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span> when we talk about the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span>

to planetary creation. And so we come to
recognize the subtle, mysterious laws of organic
growth - not as displacing the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> creative

From The
Fudge Family in Paris we learn that a certain
forcible expression, impossible in English,
"doesn't sound half so shocking in French," and
on the same principle an idea merely formulated
in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> that no one stops to invest with a

depicted on canvas by means of oil colour.

with it - Draper and others - dwelt especially on
the savage ferocity with which the early Church
endeavoured to stifle astronomical discovery.
Faith, at that time, might have been correctly
described as "the faculty that enables us to

believe what we know to be untrue." It was
endangered by the astronomical emphasis of the
untruthfulness in question, but in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> run,
as astronomy held the field, <span class="t4 t7 t12 t16 hoverable">faith</span> fell into line
with discovery, and in spite of ecclesiastical
opposition became ennobled in character. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span>
of a Semitic tribe might with an effort of
imagination be fitted into an armchair. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span>

And if we attempt to strain imagination by

But astronomical discovery does not come to a

connection with that question, in the fascinating
pursuit known to science as "extrapolation" - the

bodies - quite all if we merely except meteorites
and some comets - move in elliptical orbits more

or less closely approximating to the circular

Sun's motion is in conformity with this general
principle, than that it is a blind rush in a

Now I must venture to outrun even extrapolation
in the explanation I have to give. I have been
permitted in the pages of the Nineteenth Century
to maintain the positon that, in the course of
the present "Armageddon," Unseen Powers embodying
loftier <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> than common humanity has <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span>
reached are taking part in the struggle. Some of
us in conscious touch with them are sometimes
with their help enabled to anticipate scientific
discovery. In that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> I was concerned, some
dozen <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> before the discovery of Radium, with
anticipations relating to the constitution of
matter, ultimately verified by that discovery and
subsequent <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> based on it. Happily those
anticipations were published at the time, so
their character as a successful forecast is not
open to dispute. In another direction certain
future conclusions in connection with astronomy
may be anticipated in their turn. The centre
around which the Solar System is gravitating will
be found to be the star Sirius. Common <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span>
gives us an approximate measure of some stellar
distances. The figure accepted by astronomers for
the moment as the distance of Sirius, taking
"light-years" as the unit, is 8.8, or <span class="t3 t11 t18 t27 hoverable">call</span> it
eight and three-quarters. A light-year is the
distance <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> crosses in a year, moving at the
rate of 186,000 miles per second. So it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be
inconvenient to give stellar distances in miles.
Moreover, there is a wide margin for possible
errors in calculations concerned with the

parallax of stars. Perhaps it will be found that
Sirius is a bit farther off than the currently
accepted calculation assumes, but anyhow the real
distance is in the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> of magnitude.
Estimates of the size and luminosity of Sirius
vary very widely - from 300 to 1000 times the
size and brighness of our Sun, but either guess
fits in with the main idea to be grasped.
Obviously our <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Sun</span> cannot be the only one that
revolves around Sirius. Directly that idea is
appreciated, we realize that Sirius must be the
central <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> of a vast system, in which such suns
as ours must be, to Sirius, what the planets are
to our Sun.
That this is so, can only be ascertained
definitely by those in touch with sources of
information not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> general reach, but at
all events, meanwhile, as a hypothesis, the
statement is clearly in harmony with the
uniformities of Nature. To regard our Solar
System and all the others presumably represented
by the millions of stars in the sky, as scattered
at random about space <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be insulting to
Supreme <span class="t12 t20 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">Wisdom</span> and Omnipotence. The conception
could only be acceptable to thinkers at the
kindergarten stage. Certainly up to the middle of
the last century grown and grave <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> did discuss
the question <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> this was the only inhabited
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> in the Universe, but increasing
<span class="t14 t24 hoverable">intelligence</span> has rendered us at once wiser and
more modest than when a doubt on that subject was
possible. I need not go over the evidence that
makes an important group of astronomers certain
that Mars (to confine our attention for a moment
to our own Solar System) is the abode of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> not
entirely unlike our own. The other planets may
not have climatic conditions like our own, but
the resources of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Nature</span> may easily provide

more about life, <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span>

with disdain the idea that any worlds - <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span>
around our <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> or in the infinitudes of space can be mere inanimate masses of <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> destitute
of the loftier purposes that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> implies.
Just for the present all information relating to
the Sirian Cosmos must remain hypothetical until
the astronomy of the future overtakes the
forecast, but its value as illuminating reverent
imagination reaching in the direction of Divinity
is very great. It helps us to realize that in all
such upward reaching we must blend with the idea
of which we are in search, the idea of infinity.
In the search <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the limits of our own Solar
System we are hopelessly dazzled <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> before we
touch those limits. But the conception of the
Sirian Cosmos shows us that incomprehensible as
the Solar Divinity may be - "That" (our miserable
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> "he" is degrading in such use) can only be
in some dependent relationship to the Divinity
guiding the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> Syrian Cosmos; in other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span>
that "God" is an infinite hierarchy. Faintly we
realize that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> - when we think of the Sirian
Cosmos - is, in some wholly incomprehensible way,
greater even (in a stupendous degree) than God,
when we think of the Solar System and of the
various worlds <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> it of which ours is one.
And, indeed, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> intelligence, limited in its
grasp of detail, unlimited when reaching out
toward infinitude, preceives, the moment this
last idea is touched, that the Sirian Cosmos
itself must be in relationship with some still
more expanded and sublime organism; that Sirius
cannot be a stationary <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> but must itself,
attended by all its family of solar systems, be
dependent on some other centre of energy, on some
other superior manifestation of the infinite God.
It is futile even to speculate as to where or
what that centre may be, but the feeling that it
must exist vaguely hints at a unity pervading the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> visible universe. Along that line of
thought, however, lies a mental bewilderment that
bars further progress. We can play in imagination

still with astronomical figures. The bright star
Arcturus is said to be 140 light-years distant
from us, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> it shines nearly as brilliantly
as Sirius. What must be its actual magnitude and
lustre? What must be its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> in the universal
scheme? And some other stars of almost equivalent
brilliancy are beyond parallactic measurement
altogether. But the purpose which all fulfil must
be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the grasp of infinite Divinity.
Science, growing more and more intimately welded
with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> aspiration as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t14 t24 hoverable">intelligence</span>
expands, grants us some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> illumination as we
seek to penetrate, so far as that may be
possible, the mysteries of the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Hierarchy.
Certainly, if we turn our attention from the
appalling magnitudes of astronomy to the
phenomena of the infinitely little, the
measurements we have to deal with are equally
bewildering. Physicists tell us that a cubic
centimetre of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> contains thirty trillions of
molecules. That if a glass globe four inches in
diameter were absolutely empty and air molecules
admitted at the rate of a hundred millions a

was full. Such figures are more amusing than
instructive, but they may help us,to some extent,
in our attempt to formulate a conception of the
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Hierarchy. The attributes of the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span>
molecules - the laws they obey, are obviously as
much an expression of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Will as the forces
that regulate the march of solar systems in the

Hierarchy extends downward, as definitely as,
beyond it, it extends upward; and though, as we
attempt to understand it in its lower levels, we
shall soon <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> mental difficulties almost as
insuperable as those attending efforts in the
other direction, we can, with help from certain
sources of information, arrive at some
intelligible conclusions.
Astronomy may still help us to some extent. The

conditions that must attend <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> in the various
planets of our system must obviously differ very
widely. Temperature may vary from below that of
ice to above that of steam. Vehicles of
<span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> - bodies of whatever <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> may be
suitable, must vary accordingly. We may safely
assume that while some of the fundamental laws of
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Nature</span> may hold <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> throughout the system,
others, for example all appertaining to organic
growth, may need local modification. Each <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span>
must be controlled, even as regards its <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span>
manifestation, by appropriate <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Agency. And
very little progress beyond primitive theology
makes us sure that, - first of all as regards our
own <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> - there are teeming regions of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span>
that lie beyond the cognition of the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span>
senses. Talk <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> of our familiar planets
should properly relate to planetary schemes,
embracing much more than visible globes. So we
reach the conception that for each planetary
scheme the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> will of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> Solar System
must transmit itself through an agency that is
still so <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> in its character as to dazzle our
mental sight.
None the less a very important stage in our study
of the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Hierarchy is reached when we
realize the principle of agency as working
through it. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> leaps to the conclusion that
this principle must be operative right down to
the subtle activities of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Nature</span> that we are in
the habit of summing up in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> "Evolution."
For the verification of this conjecture we must
obviously be dependent on information received
from those sources of super-physical <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span>
above referred to, such information in turn being
only subject to the check imposed by our own
critical faculties. Does it appeal to our
<span class="t14 t24 hoverable">intelligence</span> as essentially reasonable in its
character? Leaving that question to be determined
later, I will first endeavour to describe the
agency through which the purpose of the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span>

out in <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> manifestation.
We have to think of the Unseen realms of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Nature</span>

(emanating from super-Divine Will) which not
merely guide organic growth but provide for the
growth of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> essence with which such
growth is associated. Language is apt to break
down in one's <span class="t13 t23 hoverable">hands</span> as a means of conveying ideas
that are inextricably blended with still more
subtle underlying ideas. We are living in a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span>

experiences of <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> in association with
<span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> environment are the conditions providing
for its growth. We may plunge down in search of
the beginnings of such growth to levels of
<span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> far below those of humanity. But
leaving that vast area of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> untrodden, the

see only a little more clearly, present to
imagination a system of natural <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">law</span> on the moral
plane as unalterable as the natural laws relating
to <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> that we deal with in the
chemist's laboratory. Those natural laws of the
moral plane are entangled with variable
influences arising from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> will, but that

of activity, so that while one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> host is

that, for want of a better comprehension of the
process, we <span class="t3 t11 t18 t27 hoverable">call</span> the principle of Evolution. And

Hierarchy is infinite in both ways; inconceivably
exalted and inconceivably minute, but in the
direction of minutiæ still conscious and
purposeful. Intelligence, with a certain range of

and even variation in the colouring of plants and
flowers. The agency concerned with such <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span>
cannot be discerned by the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> senses, but
finer senses can already sometimes cognize its
operation, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> most of us are still too young
in evolution to have come into <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span> possession of
all the faculties latent in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> nature. "We are

times."
So brief a sketch as this must be content in some
directions with mere faint hints. How do the

the evolution of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> translate their
superphysical powers to the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> plane? The
answer has to do with what may be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the
semi-intelligent mechanism of Nature. The mere
phrase is bewildering, but it deals with certain
aspects of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Nature</span> that science must concern
itself with before long. "Elemental Agency"
cannot properly be regarded as belonging to the

constitutes a vast subsidiary evolution by
itself; cosmic in its character: related to much
more than the interests of this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> alone;
beginning on levels commensurate with the
electron in magnitude and importance, rising to
conditions in which definite forms in certain

fine orders of <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> are identifiable by
observers, with adequately clairvoyant senses, as
associated with specific functions in Nature.
Elementals constitute the link between will <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> or <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> - and <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> manifestation.
Obviously the subject is one of stupendous
magnitude. No <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> could burn, no plant could

science comes to grapple with the intricacies of
this so far hidden aspect of Nature, it will look
back to its present condition as one barely
emerging from the dark ages.
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> vast and complicated is the agency by which

as best we may with the idea of hierarchies

which a stupendous drama is in process of
performance. The scenery and decorations are
provided by <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> agency, and the actors are
responsible - if we push the metaphor to its
extreme limits - for the parts they play. In
other words, while <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> agency invests them
with their opportunity, their own <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> will is
<span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> to determine the <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> they make of this. But
they must not be allowed to wreck the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span>
undertaking by too gross a misuse of that <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span>
will. The drama is intended to have a happy
ending. So over and above or apart from the
hierarchies that provide the conditions <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span>
ordination provides for a governing hierarchy
that does not actually control the actors - put
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> into their mouths, so to speak, or manage
them like marionettes - but causes them to feel
disagreeable consequences from blundering;
invests them with larger <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> as they
willingly fall into line with the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> idea. Of
course that governing hierarchy is merged in its
loftier levels with the superior agents of
infinite Divinity, but on its less exalted levels

is in close touch with our own humanity. This
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> leads up to what is perhaps the most
important idea of all that I have been
endeavouring to suggest. Humanity itself recruits
the governing hierarchy. Its members on the first
important level above ordinary humanity have
been, at some remote periods in the past, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span>

realms of infinite Love? The problem has been
dealt with at some length in articles for the
Nineteenth Century,¹ and need only be referred to
now. Freewill, in one word, is the answer. The
ultimate evolution of individual humanity can
only be accomplished by investing each unit with
the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> attribute of freewill in a greater or
less degree. Half-fledged humanity of the kind
around us in abundance is hardly conscious of the
extent to which it enjoys this attribute. It
becomes more and more available as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span>

gathered experience and effort entitle it to
those of the loftiest order. The appreciation of
this idea marks a huge advance beyond the
primitive conception of an <span class="t20 hoverable">eternal</span> perpetuation
of each grotesquely incomplete being. But such an
appreciation is merely a step in the direction of
the grander conception. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> level of
moral and intellectual attainment on the stage of

this world's potentialities is but as new
beginning, a point of departure for a progress
beyond the precise comprehension of physically
incarnate intelligence, but happily not
altogether veiled from our view. No <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> for
the moment <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> there be other worlds
affording still more favourable opportunities for
embodied consciousness. That is no concern of
ours. We may be fully content to know that
however the preparatory processes leading up to
the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Hierarchy may be provided for in other

NATURALLY enough the tragedies of the War have
imparted thrilling interest to some questions
carelessly disregarded by the multitude during
normal periods. Is there an after <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> for all of
us when we "die"? Can we <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> out anything about
it in advance? Can we communicate with those who
have already passed on? Most current essays
dealing with such perplexities have a ludicrous
aspect for millions of spiritualists in constant
touch with departed friends, for all occult
students and for most psychic researchers. A
writer in these pages last month calmly asserts
that communication with the dead "has never been
definitely proved to be anything but delusion or
fraud." If equally ignorant in other directions
he might deal in the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> with any scientific
discovery, say, the retrograde motion of some
planetary satellites, or the transmutations of
radium. The vast literature of spiritualism is
flooded with proof of the main idea. More
recently the literature of occult research is
rich in detail concerning the conditions of the
after life.¹ To say that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> <span class="t23 t28 hoverable">thereof</span> has
made "no substantial progress whatever" is like
asserting that since Galvani's experiment with
frogs' legs our <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of electricity has made
no progress whatever. Raymond, attracting
deserved attention on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of its authorship,
is only the latest contribution to inumerable
records of a similar kind, the cumulative
significance of which is overwhelming, while all
who are patient and painstaking get personal
conviction for themselves.

Some of the books named relate to Spiritualism, some to
Theosophy or occult science generally. They are a mere
handful compared with any complete bibliography of either
subject.

Spiritualists for the most part are content with
this. They know their departed friends still live
and get assurance of their welfare. They look
forward wih confidence to their own future.
Occult students <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> that, besides evidence of
that order, minute information relating to the
conditions of the after <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> can be obtained by

clairvoyant faculties of an appropriate kind.
Abundant information is accumulating in the
literature of occult research along these lines.
In no department of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> activity has more

science. That progress has carried the occult
student far beyond elementary discoveries
relating to the immediate experiences of the next
life. Certainly these are intensely interesting,
but do not in themselves enable us to obtain a
comprehensive grasp of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> scheme of
evolution to which humanity belongs.

ultimate destinies. Later developments of occult
science enable us to appreciate both the value
and limitations of spiritualism. The mediumship
on which it relies is better understood now than
at first. <span class="t1 hoverable">Physical</span> phenomena are <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> about
when certain invisible factors in the medium's
constitution can be withdrawn for <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> by
elemental agency. Messages come through when
certain organs in the medium's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> respond to

perceive. But the medium in either <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> is a
passive instrument in the <span class="t13 t23 hoverable">hands</span> of invisible
operators, and these are of all varieties. That
accounts for the nonsense that often discredits
the method. The lower regions of the next <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span>
swarm with the (morally and intellectually) lower
classes of humanity dying constantly by the
thousands, and (for a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> at all events)
remaining as unintelligent as they were in life.
Their influences and messages are ignoble and
stupid, but even then they serve their purpose.
They show us in touch with another plane of
existence. And meanwhile more enlightened
inhabitants of that plane also communicate as the
literature of spiritualism shows.
But spiritualism, having broken down the deadly
materialism into which <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> was drifting

development of occult science. The later
literature referred to above illuminates its
origin and progress. The new <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of Evolution,
of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> destiny, and the economy of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Nature</span>
generally, which it has unfolded for us, cannot
be fully interpreted <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the limits of a

for its purpose, that this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> is the region in
which that progress has to be accomplished, that
other realms of <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> are the regions in

provides for invigorating rest, leads us to the
important conception that each <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> is
merely one of a series; that whatever experiences
intervene between each we shall all of us come
back again and again to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of the kind we are
familiar with here, that Reincarnation is as
certain a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">law</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Nature</span> as the circulation of the
blood.

Reincarnation when first scientifically defined
some thirty-odd <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> ago was quickly seen to
solve many previously insoluble problems. The
hideous inequalities of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> condition no longer
seemed to insult <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> justice. Suffering became
intelligible when the conditions of each new <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span>
were realized as the consequences of previous
"doing" (or Karma). The superficial objection,
that the sufferer did not remember his former
misdoing, was dissipated as we realized that the
<span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">Higher</span> Self did so, and profited by each <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span>
plane experience. Further <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> showed that
humanity is still in its youth. A few more
advanced than the multitude do remember former
lives. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> course of reasoning need not be
repeated here. The appreciation of rebirth as
essential to a comprehension of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> is
already widely spread. By <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> of
misunderstanding details many <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> regard it
with dislike, and the dislike has been
accentuated by the eagerness of those who seized

Only by failing to understand it correctly can
anyone fall into the habit of criticising the
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> scheme of evolution unfavourably. The
personality of a brutal criminal in the slums is
clearly not fit for <span class="t20 hoverable">eternal</span> perpetuation. The
bishop in his palace, if he honestly considers
the matter, will come to the same conclusion as
regards himself. "We are ancients of the Earth,"
etc., and, as we look back on those who millions
of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> ago were more ancient still, we can see
how better worth perpetuation we shall be when
wider experiences of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> shall have lifted us as
far beyond our present condition as we now are
beyond that of our Stone Age predecessors ourselves in former lives. Probably, indeed,

there will be no stage of growth from which the
perpetuation of that stage <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be conceivable.
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">Spiritual</span> progress must be infinite, but with
that which lies beyond the perfection of humanity
we can only be concerned much later on. Our
present purpose should be to understand the laws

us who have <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> adequate advantage of modern
opportunities need not speculate about the
chances of survival after death. That is utterly
familiar knowledge, and, with varying facilities,
many of us are in communication with friends who
have passed on, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> it does not always happen

the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> vehicle of <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> is already

"The Astral Plane" is the term generally <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> by
occultists to designate the vast realm of unseen
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> immediately surrounding this globe. It is
not a well-chosen term, as the region in question
has nothing to do with the stars, but it has
become rooted in occult phraesology, and we
cannot now escape from its use. It is really a
vast concentric sphere of <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> that does not
appeal to our <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> senses; far greater in

size than the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> globe it embraces,
including an enormous variety of conditions, some
of them highly disagreeable; but of these it is
needless to <span class="t9 t11 t20 t21 t22 t23 t27 hoverable">speak</span> for the moment, as the vast
majority of decently behaved <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> will have
nothing to do with them but will <span class="t6 t9 t13 t15 t17 t18 t23 t28 t29 hoverable">pass</span> at once,
when <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> of the body, to regions where they will
<span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> themselves happier than they are likely to
have ever been, even under favourable
circumstances, in the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> life. Naturally
the character of such happiness is determined by
the <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> that has been made of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> and

direction of Berkeley it is obvious that the
reality of <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> for us is due to the appeal it
makes to our senses. Even on this plane some
kinds of <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> - most gases - make no appeal to
the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> of sight, but we know of them by means
of other senses, other avenues to consciousness.
But most of us have no senses through which
astral <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> can affect our consciousness. Many,
however, have, and that is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> secret of

of any sane denial. Clairvoyants can in some
cases see the forms in which astral <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> is
expressed. For the most part their astral senses
are partially smothered by their association with
<span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> senses. Those, however, who can - as the
phrase goes - get out of the body, and exist
prematurely in the astral plane, in the vehicle

of <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> that will not be in perfect
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> for <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> until the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> body, at death,
is finally got rid of, such persons become at
once fully conscious of the astral realm, and this is the important point to realize - cease
for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> to be conscious of the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span>
realm. It does not exist for them any more than
the astral <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> exists for the commonplace <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span>
in the street. All this is not guesswork or
metaphysical speculation. It is the definite
result of observation as scientific in its
character as that concerned with astronomy or
spectrascopic analysis. And the final result is
that we are now in a position to know that when
we look up into the sky and see nothing between
us and the stars, we are really looking through a
realm as rich in detail as the landscape we can
see on a fine <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> from a mountain top. This

The astral <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> is not merely a concentric

spheres, generally spoken of by occult scientists
as "sub-planes." Counting from below upwards, the
first and second, actually immersed in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span>

above the earth's surface, is still a comfortless
region in which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> who have been too deeply

may have to spend a period of purification before
ascending to happier levels; but this vast and
highly varied range of experience may be ignored
for the moment as it need not disturb the
apprehensions either of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> who lead fairly

varied, happiness is the underlying principle of
all sensation and experience.
Obviously the conditions that make for happiness
will be very different for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> who, however

to wait for this there will be partial reunion

adapted for the expansion of such <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> and
capacity as they generally desire.
These lofty levels share some characteristics
with the fourth level but are less earth-like in
their superficial aspect. The conditions of the
lower fourth - for the sub-planes include much
variety - are curiously earth-like. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Life</span> there is

ultimately attainable by all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> beings, is a
gradual progress just as the acorn becomes the
oak by degrees, not between to-day and to-morrow.
If anyone is discontented with this explanation
because he thinks of a beloved daughter (for
instance) as turned into an angel of light, the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> after her death, and in touch with the throne
of omniscience, he has failed to appreciate the
magnificence of the scale on which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span>
perfection is gradually developed. Some of us may
already be exquisite in goodness, as we measure
character, some of us already splendid in
intellectual grandeur, but infinitude is a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span>
story. Eternity cannot be hustled. The
achievement of the modern occultist has to do
with the illumination of the relatively immediate

future.
And some details of that fascinating period are
already <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the range of our comprehension.
Astral <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> is plastic to the creative <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of
thought. With a vivid imagination here we can
mentally almost visualize objects we might <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span>
to possess. On the astral plane under similar
conditions, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> desired - appropriate

that they do not need houses, furniture, and so
on, those cease to make their appearance on the
<span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> levels, where scenes of natural beauty
provide for all the wants of inhabitants
incapable of fatigue, hunger, or thirst,
unconscious of either heat or cold. They may be
fully conscious, none the less, of the
intellectual interests they may have been
concerned with in <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> life, and may continue
in touch with the progress of <span class="t2 t6 t8 t9 t10 t15 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">art</span> or discovery
down here, in a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> it is hardly possible to
describe in a few words.
This outline sketch of the astral <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> could,
indeed, be filled in with much further detail and
even be supplemented with some description of
planes or spheres <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> and beyond the astral.
But in attempting to explore these, incarnate
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t14 t24 hoverable">intelligence</span> is up against conditions that
defy the resources of language. For every Ego,
indeed, each experience of astral <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> must come
to an end sooner or later, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> it may extend
to many centuries of our time, and must almost
always culminate in some touch with the lofty
plane beyond; but for the humbler, less developed
entities this touch <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> hardly involve

unconscious plunge back into incarnation. The

better understanding of that plunge by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>

necessity of reincarnation as a principle, but
dislike the idea for want of comprehending its
method, is supremely desirable.
The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">law</span> applies to all, but is so elastic as to
fit in with very different volumes of
circumstance. First we must remember that Egos
ripe for reincarnation represent very different
stages of development. The humblest of these,
leaving out quite savage races that we need not
think about for the moment, is not a very
expanded being when, after a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> stay on the

and remains its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> nucleus. The Law,
guided by <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> agency, puts that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span>
nucleus in touch with a new birth, and there is
not much <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> on <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> planes to
be <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> of as the <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">Higher</span> Self of the new
personality. But in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of the highly
developed entity astral experience, instead of
obliterating unimportant memories, has enormously
expanded those that are important. The Ego as it
stands ready for reincarnation is a being on the
Astral Plane of immense complication, built up by
the experience of many lives in the past, by that
of many intervening astral episodes. He is
probably something much more than can be fully
expressed in its next immersion in <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span>
matter. He will remain, all through the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span>
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> to come, the <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">Higher</span> Self of the visible
entity, of which the visible entity in its
<span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> brain will have but little
consciousness. But, by the hypothesis, enough of
th real complete being will be expressed on the
<span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> plane to make the new incarnation
greater than ever along the lines of its former
growth. If a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> scientist before, a greater
scientist again. If a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> poet, a greater, and
so on. But the point to be emphasized for the
moment is that, while the new <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> is growing,
the actual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> intellectual being destined to

use it at maturity is doing little more than
looking on from above. If that idea can once be
properly grasped, it does away with the <span class="t28 hoverable">fear</span> some
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> seem to feel, to the effect that they with
their present volume of <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> will have
to go through babyhood and all the experiences of
the nursery when they come back to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> life.
During all that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> they will simply be looking
on from above. To understand fully how it will
come to <span class="t6 t9 t13 t15 t17 t18 t23 t28 t29 hoverable">pass</span> that the baby and the young child
will in a certain <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> be conscious also, is
very difficult for most of us, but, however
faintly, that is what has to be realized. There
is so little of the real Ego in the new child up
to seven <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> of age that, if it dies <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span>
that time, the trace of <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> it has been
expressing simply reverts to the <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">Higher</span> Self, who
makes another attempt a little later on and
begins to animate a new form, not infrequently in
the same family as the first. The mother's pretty
belief that a later child is her first baby
restored to her is often the outcome of a literal
scientific truth.
If all goes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> the first seven <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> of the new
child's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> is spent in the growth of certain
invisible accessories of the body, which medical
science will sooner or later be concerned with
investigating. And, again, the next seven <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span>
are spent in further developments of the same
order, but by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> the boy or girl is
fourteen a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> deal of the real entity is
beginning to express itself. Not the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> by any
means, nor even the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> of that designed for
expression in the new life. But now the old
astral is beginning to be wanted no more. In the
new <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> the Ego is forming for itself a new
astral. The <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">Higher</span> Self remaining in touch with
lofty planes will, for any expresssion it may
need on the astral plane, make <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> of the new
astral. Of course all these changes fade one into
another like dissolving views. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Nature</span> is rarely
addicted to abrupt metamorphoses.

Mutalis mutandis, the process of incarnation as
described above with reference to a welldeveloped Ego is applicable also to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> at
intervening stages of growth. The return to
<span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> is never attended by inconveniently
premature <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> in the new body. Or this
broad rule is only in rare cases partially
infringed. Here and there, for example, young
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">children</span> have been known to show musical talent
at a ridiculously early age. In such cases the
Ego of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> musician in the background is so
eager to express itself on the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> plane
that it cannot wait till the new instrument is
properly tuned for the task. But even Mozarts who
play the piano at six are not all there. Their
condition is so exceptional that it need not be
minutely examined in connection with any sweeping
survey of the laws governing reincarnation.
But one essential principle must never be
forgotten. Guided by supreme <span class="t12 t20 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">wisdom</span> and power,
each new incarnation is conditioned by the merit
or demerit of the Ego returning to <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> life.
Students of heredity generally make the mistake
of supposing that ancestral attributes are the
cause of characteristics reproduced in the
descendant. The descendant has been planted in
that family because bodily heredity <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> there
provide it with a <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> vehicle qualified to
give expression to its own inner nature. And,
beyond this, because the circumstances of that
life's programme fit in with the requirements of
absolute justice as regards the claims of the Ego
for happiness or its deserts as regards trouble.
The infinite skill of the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Power</span> regulating
the details of each rebirth blends the

explanation, in happiness or the reverse during
the astral life. But that is only the first part
of the story. A fundamental law, equivalent, on
<span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> levels of nature, to the conservation of
energy in mechanics, asserts itself with every
entity coming back to incarnation in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span>

during the previous life, or sometimes going back
behind that, during previous lives. And, again,

aspirations in any given life, when sustained and
intense, are an important factor in generating
the environment of the next. To <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> with the

with precision, with exact comprehension of what
he wants, and then such longing becomes a natural
force tending to colour his next incarnation. And
the principle really operates so widely as to
<span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> about a gradual upward drift in social

merely a broad rule subject to frequent
exceptions. Sometimes the Karma of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> spent
on <span class="t23 hoverable">high</span> levels may necessitate a plunge to lower,

immediate future and the ultimate future; more
specifically it colours <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> on the astral plane

the astral period is happy and restful, often
associated with opportunities of doing useful

in some respects, it may be that such misdoing
has been of a kind so exclusively identified with
<span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> that it can only give rise to

has been of a kind that deeply colours the
surviving <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> of the Ego, it may
entangle him, when first passing on, in the <span class="t7 hoverable">third</span>
level of the astral world. That is a region of
varied discomfort in which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> have to realize
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of their misdoing and shed the desires
that have given rise to it. In bad cases that are
not of the supremely bad order, the purification
may be rather a slow process, but assuming that
the character of the <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> going through it is
tainted merely - not predominately <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> - the
ultimate <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> to the happy levels already
(very imperfectly) described is assured, not
merely in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> run, but very likely in a
short one.
In awfully serious cases the course of astral

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> wickedness that is altogether in a
different category from those that are mere
vices. The sinful character of these - the mere
vices - is often exaggerated; but cruelty, that
worst and horrible <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of cruelty which takes
actual pleasure in the infliction of and sight of
pain and suffering in others, is an attribute
that drives the authors of such hideous misdoing
down into that appalling submerged level of the

astral <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> with which most of those even in
need of purification have nothing whatever to do.
Even that region must be <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> of as
purgatorial. Its fearful experiences may at last
cure or begin the cure of the most ghastly
offenders against the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Law</span> of <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t8 t13 t15 t17 t18 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> (of

imagination shrinks from the attempt to realize
the details of the sufferings incidental to
<span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> on the terrible submerged level. Their
duration, in the worst cases, may be counted in
centuries of our time. In others, a brief
experience of this character may give rise to the
needful revulsion of feeling. But <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span>

to in occult literature as the Masters of Wisdom,
and they are always ready to help forward the
abnormal progress of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> who have acquired

to bear fruit. A perfectly commonplace <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span>

the aspirant to incarnations in which he may
accomplish results the dignity and grandeur of
which cannot easily be exaggerated. Something
beyond mere personal happiness is then seen to be
the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of attainment. This <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> is the

condition involves a species of exalted beatitude
which is something greater than and beyond
personal happiness is a <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> that may fairly

one that does not cover the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> idea, too

advanced thinkers, all reference to the changes
inaugurated by each <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> death. When the
grave swallows any particular vehicle of
<span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> that we have done with, it
certainly marks an important stage of our
progress through the infinitudes of life, and
represents a very tiresome circumstance connected
with this early period of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> evolution; but
only while we are suffering from the sad
imperfections of conventional teaching is the
grave surrounded with terror.
The purpose of this article has not been merely
to dissipate that terror, but to elucidate, for
those who may <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> since have ceased to feel it,

plenty of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> in Eternity. Does anyone imagine

If he continues hereafter to entertain that view,
then he will have more. Or if he has no such farreaching aspiration, and finds himself content

method of rebirth, the fullest acquaintance with

RELIGION UNDER REPAIR
ON the 14th of April, 1917, The Times published
an article entitled "Sheep <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> a Shepherd,"
which, gently and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> bitterness but in
equivocal terms, described the conventional
religion of the Churches and all their creeds as
hopelessly out of date. Thinking <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> and women
were represented as convinced that religion must
be rediscovered from the beginning. The clergyman
and his religion "belong to a dead past."
Thinking <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> "turn away from the Churches more
and more as their interest in religion grows."
What they need is "a conception of the Universe
in which they may <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> their place." They believe
in Christianity but they need an expression of it
that will satisfy intelligence. "The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of
cleansing for the Christian theology has been
delayed so <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> that there is a danger lest the
mass of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> should think it all litter and dust
of the past." The Churches have fancied that the
danger <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be staved off "by the slow,
reluctant relinquishing of this or that belief as
it became impossible." The real need is for
discovery and growth. The Church "must not be
content any longer to talk pious nonsense in the
hope that it will seem <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> because it is
pious."
One might have supposed that so sweeping an
indictment as this, directed against vested
interests firmly rooted in social life, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span>
have provoked a storm of criticism and a flood of
sympathetic reiteration. Has orthodoxy preferred
silence as on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> safer than defence that
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> provoke fresh attack? If so, the <span class="t28 hoverable">fear</span> is
misdirected, because it is based on a
misunderstanding of the attack. The clergyman
accused of talking pious nonsense thinks the
accuser an atheist denying God. The accuser is
simply indignant with the clergyman for
caricaturing God. There <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> still be a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span>
for that clergyman among us if he could be taught

to reverence <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> wisely. Has that attitude of
<span class="t8 t12 t17 hoverable">wise</span> reverence been attained by any of the
earnest thinkers discontented with the
clergyman's teaching? Has discovery really
anticipated the demand for it <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> forth in the
article quoted? Are the answers available for
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> who "ask real questions about the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span>
of the Universe," and may there not be already a
considerable <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> of others who have profited
during the last thirty <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> from wide publicity

reserved for a peculiarly qualified few?
The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> answer to that last question is in the
affirmative, and those who have been concerned
during recent <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> with the assimilation of

craving represented by The Times article. Many
books convey this to all who care to read, and
describe the sources from which it is derived.
For some of us who are students of occult science
and philosophy the authors of the teaching given
out are seen to have extraordinary claims on our
trust. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of these claims can better be
appreciated after we have fairly considered the
general outline of the teaching they convey. It
constitutes a complete response to the demand <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span>
forth in The Times article. It does give us a
comprehensive <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of the Cosmos to which we

of religion. It does much more than this because
it gives us a perfectly clear <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of the course
of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> evolution, dissipating all the darkness

change and pointing out the path to be ultimately
trodden, leading to infinitudes of progress. The
<span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of Divinity, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Life</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Nature</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> afforded -

conveniently to be described as the <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">Higher</span>
Occultism - makes its first claim on respectful
consideration by its own inherent reasonableness.
It is vast in its scope, widely ramifying in all
directions, but perfectly coherent,
scientifically harmonious; all parts of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span>
mutually supporting each other. In one way, that
is a difficulty for the beginner approaching the
study of the <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">Higher</span> Occultism. The comprehension
of - not necessarily the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> because the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span>
is an infinitude - but of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> volume of

adequate appreciation of its parts separately.
But eventually when enough is grasped, conviction
sets in as an intellectual necessity, and then,
among other conclusions, the honest student
realizes that the <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">Higher</span> Occultism has been a
gift to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> from Teachers who are obviously
entitled to profound trust. But his perception of
this is no longer needed as a guarantee of the
teaching. It embodies its own confirmation.
Perhaps this can only be fully appreciated after
a more exhaustive study of super-physical science
than can be provided for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the limits of a

that is by itself a condition which tends to
fortify belief in what can be seen. No theory
which invested Eternity with a beginning and an

Supreme Divinity is necessarily infinite and must
have reference to manifestations in millions of
worlds besides our own. And <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> we feel sure that

from humanity. Common conceptions of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span>
evolution have correctly hit off the idea that it
is recruited itself from lower forms of life.
Prevailing belief, however, has not grasped the

the world's history this was more generally
appreciated than it has been in recent years. In

<span class="t14 t24 hoverable">intelligence</span> should be trained in the study of

testimony, amusing to the occultist, to the
accuracy of his diagnosis.
The principle just hinted at - that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span>
evolution does not stop short at the stage
reached by the most brilliant representatives of
current civilization - leads on to the
appreciation of the idea that infinitude is
applicable to that evolution, as to the loftier
conception of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> nature. The idea is best
understood by tracing it back to some extent into
the past. <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">Consciousness</span> - which eludes research
in the dissecting room - is, in a certain sense,
uniform in its nature; incomprehensible as
regards its essence, but vaguely acceptable as
somehow of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> origin. As above pointed out,
its scope and range are determined by the vehicle
or sheath in which it is involved. The <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span>

like to think of, <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> has obviously a
very limited scope compared with our own. The
splendid <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> Darwin threw on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Nature</span> showed us
the growth of form, following certain <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span>
plane impulses. The occultist at first only found
fault with the theory as ignoring the
simultaneous evolution of consciousness. A
clearer <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> has since been obtained. In the
lower animal forms <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> has not been

individualized. But an aggregate volume of
<span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> animating many lower forms
gradually feels the need of animating <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span>
ones. Fully developed, the description of the
process <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be very protracted. Eventually in
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> animal forms <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> is
individualized and passes under well-understood
conditions into the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> form, not at once into
one of <span class="t23 hoverable">high</span> development. By this time, however,
the individualized <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> may be treated
as an Ego subject to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">law</span> of reincarnation. At
first its progress may be <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> of as the
growth of the Ego - its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> growth going on
concurrently with the improvement in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span>

this <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> to be reconciled with the theory that
<span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> is identical in essence throughout
Nature? Quite easily, for all who profit by what
is known concerning the laws governing
reincarnation. <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">Desire</span> is one of them. <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">Desire</span> for

the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> at a humble level does not know enough to
formulate such a <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> explicitly. He does it
automatically by making the best <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span>

wants, but gets it by unconsciously conforming to
the law. On a <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> level he obeys it
consciously, and the result is the same. On all
levels, of course short of those that are very
exalted, action <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> or bad - Karma, to <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> the

retards the result, and a mere recognition of the

to explain and justify the conditions of the

believe, from some Oriental scripture, runs as

Life, the infusion of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> into
matter, is a vast coherent phenomenon in Nature,
limitless in all directions. The idea may be
approached by considering its bearing on the
Solar System, itself, as we are enabled now to
realize, a coherent scheme of manifestation, all
its parts inter-related one with another, and as
a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> inter-related with a larger Cosmos.
Common astronomy deals with the magnitudes,
distances, and movements of the various planets
constituting the Solar System, and to some extent
with their relative stages of development.
Jupiter, for example, is obviously a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> in an
early stage of its growth, because it is still
hot - almost incandescent. Occult astronomy which might be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Vital Astronomy - deals
with the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> going on in each planet, or for
which each is the preparation. In most cases each
planet is part of an (apparently) independent
scheme of evolution. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> the planet Venus
belongs to a senior scheme as compared with that

here. But there, as here, individual growth has
been affected by the play of individual <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">Free</span> Will

attained to highly exalted conditions, some have
dropped off in the course of bygone ages, the
Egos having failed to attain conditions
qualifying them to reincarnate among the more
advanced majority. Their destiny is intensely
interesting, as illuminating to the economy of
the Solar System as a whole. There is no final
perdition for the failures of each planetary
scheme in turn. They <span class="t6 t9 t13 t15 t17 t18 t23 t28 t29 hoverable">pass</span> on to the next scheme!
The failures of the Senior Venus scheme are

merged in the humanity of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Earth</span> scheme. The
further details of this process are of increasing
interest. The failures concerned, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span>

at a later stage than that generally reached so
far by the foremost races, even, of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Earth</span>

her usual competent fashion, but to make the
solution intelligible the conditions of our own
planetary scheme must be <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> into account. In
our <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> planets are linked <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> in one
comprehensive evolution. Of course, the <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> of
this is intelligible, but that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span>
story by itself and may be <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> aside for the
moment. Our <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> family is at present
distributed over <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> worlds - Mars, the Earth,
and Mercury. Silly criticism based on ignorance
may fall foul of this statement on the ground
that Mercury - so near the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Sun</span> - must be too hot
for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> life. Too hot certainly for bodies of
our <span class="t21 hoverable">flesh</span> and blood, but the chemistry of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Nature</span>
can solve more intricate problems than those
merely of temperature. Mercury bodies are adapted
to temperatures in which our own could not exist.
Now the main <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> of our <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> family is here on
Earth, but an inferior remnant at a very low and
coarse stage of development - the dregs of our
humanity, so to <span class="t9 t11 t20 t21 t22 t23 t27 hoverable">speak</span> - is still on Mars. A
vanguard of peculiarly advanced Egos is already
on Mercury, leading a more beautiful <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> than
any of which the Earth's main <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> has <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> had
experience. That advanced vanguard supplies the
Venus failures with suitable opportunities for
incarnation, and the bulk of the Mercury
population at the present <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> had to begin with
a Venus origin. Of course, the numbers are not
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> compared with those of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Earth</span> - taking
those to include Egos in and out of incarnation in <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> bodies, that is to say, and on the

higher spheres surrounding the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> planet.
The importance of the explanation just given
turns on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> it shows the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> Solar System
as a coherent organism, for obviously the system
now operative as between the senior evolution of
Venus and the next in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> - our own - will go
on providing for the evolution, at remote periods
in the future, of the outer planets, Jupiter,
Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. Circumstances will no
doubt vary in these far-off regions of the
stupendous <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> programme, but the leading idea
establishes the unity <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> diversity of the
plan that the Solar System represents.
This <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> through comprehensive sketch of the
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> plan will enable the reader incidentally
to understand how the students of occult or Vital
Astronomy obtain their information, obviously of
a kind that no commonplace <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> faculties can
possibly deal with. We see <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> evolutions
extending upward, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> any break of
continuity, to the nearest levels of the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span>
Hierarchy. We realize the unbroken continuity of
<span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> beyond those levels, so that
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of the kind that seems at the first
glance to belong to Divinity itself must filter
down to the lower levels of the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Hierarchy.
Then we begin to understand how the <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">Beings</span> on
those levels - in touch in one direction with
relatively Infinite Wisdom, in the other with
ordinary humanity - may see fit to <span class="t6 t9 t13 t15 t17 t18 t23 t28 t29 hoverable">pass</span> on to
some qualified pupils in ordinary humanity some
information illuminating the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> and the Cosmos
to which that ordinary humanity belongs. Indeed,
it is obvious that sooner or later such
information must be passed on, to provide for the
fulfilment of the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Plan. At earlier stages
of growth humanity was not in need of all this
lofty teaching. It had to accomplish certain
achievements - now, from the <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> point of
view, essential preliminary undertakings.
Humanity had to learn simple broad principles of

moral science, to grapple with the vague idea
that there was some <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> mystery pervading the
world. The religions of various periods met this
need with more or less success. It did not much
<span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> at first that they were irrational in
their design. In <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">days</span> of one early papacy, for
example, when priests disputed as to <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span>
<span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Christ</span> was the real son, or an adopted son, of
God, religious <span class="t14 t24 hoverable">intelligence</span> was not ripe for more
suitable discussion concerning the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span>
Hierarchy. The writer of the article on "Sheep

the present <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> are not much more ready for it.
However this may be, some of them must be ready,
and outside the Church a sufficient <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> have
been found ready, to justify the <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span> blow of the
teaching which this paper partly embodies. Then,
again, for the last <span class="t15 t23 hoverable">thousand</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> or so,
humanity has been getting ready for <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span>
teaching by perfecting its thinking capacity. The
study of <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> science has polished <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span>
brains to a <span class="t23 hoverable">high</span> degree of delicacy. That had to
be done before religion could be levelled up.
Habits of scientific thinking have certainly
paved the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> for appreciating the credibility of
occult teaching, better than the mental training
of the theologian plodding in the path of
medieval creeds. A considerable <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span>

the past. Only as we become possessed of the

further growth of humanity towards <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span>
conditions of being can only be accomplished by a
humanity comprehending its purpose and potential
destinies. That level of the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Hierarchy

humanity has to watch over, guide, and promote
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> growth of that ordinary humanity.
As those ready for new conditions become more and

more numerous, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> of those who link
humanity with the hierarchy becomes more and more
important and exacting. The occult student
generally refers to those who are the links in
question as the Masters of Wisdom. The title will
serve for the moment, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> we may eventually

ripening by degrees, their numbers must be
recruited. That can only be done as the more

evolution of a humanity, in fact, is analogous to
that of a single entity. In childhood his growth,
well-being and education depend on others.
Teaching gradually enables him to realize that
his own will and effort must be <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> into play
to accomplish growth beyond a certain stage. His
later development must depend on himself. So with
humanity at large. The evolutionary <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">law</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span>
under loftier guidance for a time; but the race
cannot improve beyond a certain stage <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span>

issue of that struggle is not in doubt. Beyond
the horrors of the final crisis there stretches
the assured vision of a beautiful future, but its
beauty will be partly due to the continual
expansion of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> which has been

of which is no less certain than the ultimate

RELIGION UNDER REPAIR: A REPLY TO
PROFESSOR LINDSAY
ENDEAVOURING to frame a crushing "rejoinder" to
my attempt to show that conventional religion is
badly in need of repair, Professor Lindsay,
writing in the Nineteenth Century, provided his
readers with so fair a summary of its contents
that he is entitled to my thanks for bringing
these afresh to the notice of any among them who
may have overlooked their first presentation. But
in failing to appreciate their importance he
shows clearly how minds untrained in the study of
Nature's super-physical mysteries are embarrassed
with prepossessions partly derived from medieval
theology and partly from materialistic habits of
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> prevalent in the last century. Current
thinking meanwhile has been deeply coloured by
the recognition of some capacities of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span>
<span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> that transcend the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> senses.
There are still many amongst us who resent subtle
discoveries outrunning their own experience. What
they can't understand they refuse to believe, and
must be <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> in the rear of mental progress. But
for those who do not protect their opinions by
carefully guarding their ignorance, some broad
convictions, at all events, are gathering
strength.
Foremost among these is the certainty that there
are avenues to perception over and above those
provided by the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> senses. If anyone now
denies the possibility of clairvoyance, he does
not express an opinion; he merely shows himself
unacquainted with certain developments of
scientific research. Again, while crowds of
blatant assailants abuse the multitudes who know
that they have touch with conditions of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span>
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> following on the change <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> death,
disbelief in that <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> where it exists is
merely due to ignorance of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> done in that
department of research. Those who challenge
either of the statements just made are not

entitled to attack a writer who takes them for
granted. The literature dealing with them is
abundant. No one addressing intelligent hearers
concerning any fresh development of superphysical research can be fairly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> on to
waste his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> in going afresh over the
rudimentary discoveries of fifty <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> ago. A
modern chemist, writing about the atomic weight
of thorium-lead, does not include in his essay an
elaborate argument to show that the measurement
of atomic weight is possible.
The stream of criticism Professor Lindsay directs
against my exposition of lately expanded teaching
concerning <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> and super-human evolution may be
partly summed up in the question "How do you
know?" expressed in various phrases, few of which
offend <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> taste in their form. But the answer
is embodied in the various books I have <span class="t0 t11 t24 hoverable">written</span>
in the last thirty-odd years, and I do not want
to go over all that ground again. I will
summarize it briefly, recognizing this as by far
the most important question that can be put by
anyone meeting with the later results of occult
research before having grown familiar with the
earlier achievements of that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> undertaking.
But in the first instance I am tempted to deal
with some amusing objections levelled by the
Professor against various "assumptions" I have
ventured to put forward as in no need of
elaborate proof.
My remark that occult research anticipated many
of the "conclusions arising from the discovery of
radium" is twisted into a statement that it
anticipated the discovery of radium, and treated
with sarcasm accordingly. The fact, as I stated
it, is simply indisputable to anyone who will
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> the trouble to read the <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">book</span> I referred to,
Occult Chemistry, and observe the date of its
publication. It is obviously impossible to repeat
the contents of that <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">book</span> here. It will be found
deeply significant for all persons interested in

chemical science.
Pantheism! There is some resemblance between the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> doctrine and the speculation going by that
name, just as there is some resemblance between
metempsychosis and reincarnation, but also all
the difference that there is between a lump of
gold-bearing quartz and a finished gold coin.
Spinoza's pantheism absorbed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Nature</span> and

recognizes the infinite, supreme, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span>

its infusion in matter. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> occult pantheism
includes Deism while clearing that conception of
its limitations. It is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> that almost all the
finished mental products of modern occult
research have been crudely anticipated in a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>

splendour of their modern presentation is due to
the extraction of the interior <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> from the
rough ore - its re-statement in terms of Western
scientific thinking. That is the answer to the
objection that my "theory is as old as
Gnosticism," and to the somewhat inane charge
that "my pretensions to unfold a new and
satisfying cosmic world-view are simply
ridiculous." That which is ridiculous is the
suggestion that in its present <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> - with modern

commanding the assent of all intelligent <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> whenever it is understood. Unhappily it is very
widely misunderstood - as by our Professor,
obviously, when he describes it as a paralyzing
doctrine of which fatalism is the natural
outcome. The natural outcome is exactly the
reverse, because it shows each <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> in turn the
expression of causes <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> in motion by the freewill of the Ego in former lives. Again, complete
explanation of the real doctrine <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> claim very
many of these pages. That doctrine is fairly <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span>
forth in my own published writings, but I do not
feel entitled to advertise them here. If anyone
thinks, along necessitarian lines, that acts in
each <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> are inevitable, and therefore, as
causes, encouraging fatalism, the answer is,
firstly, a contradiction of the assumption
arising from our <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> Karma is
adjusted by the Elemental agents of the Lipika! I
<span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> technical phraseology for the moment, to hint
that in dealing with the <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">Higher</span> Occultism I am
skirting the confines of an elaborate science.
The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> above will have a definite <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span>
for every Theosophical student, and will, I
venture to think, be quite destitute of <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span>
for the Professor. Secondly, the <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> why
incarnation provides for intellectual moral and
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> growth and expansion is to be discerned
in the fact, so ill-understood by the
materialistic science of the last century, that
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">Thought</span> is a force. Again, that is a statement
that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> ignorant of all that has been done in
psychic research during the last quarter of the
last century will not understand, and, therefore,
will foolishly deny. The influence of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> on
future incarnations has been elaborately traced
in my own and other current books. In <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> it
determines their course. And, when understood,

reincarnation becomes not only acceptable but the
only thinkable method of carrying on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span>
evolution. Some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> are frightened of it,
because they foolishly imagine that it means
their own individuality and <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span>
immersed in a baby form, and miserable in such a
condition. Their <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> during the baby
period will be on a <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> plane in another
vehicle. They will not enter their new bodies
till these are mature far beyond the stage of the
nursery. How can I convey a glimmer of the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span>
in a few words? The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> entity of an
advanced representative of a highly civilized
race may be older than this world. His or her
incarnate personality, in any given case, may be
only a partial incarnation. There is a <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">Higher</span>
Self, the part of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> self, on a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span>
plane all the while. Clairvoyants, adequately
endowed, can see the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">law</span> at work. Mesmeric
practice will often enable one to get touch
through a personality with his or her <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">Higher</span>
Self, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> not merely verify its <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span>
but acquire voluminous information concerning the
conditions of the super-physical realms of
<span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> belonging to this world. These
become so familiar to the qualified occult
investigator, that current discussions as to
<span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> they do really exist or not are more
ludicrous in his sight than the outsider who
never concerns himself with such inquiries can
easily imagine. And students of occultism will be
even more amused by the Professor's criticism to
the effect that their studies throw "no <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> on
the problems of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> and consciousness." Their
literature is saturated with ethical teaching of
an exalted order, which bears on every imaginable
problem of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> and consciousness. Some
Theosophical writers, indeed, are so dominated by
the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> that nothing matters except the
cultivation of the loftiest moral virtues, that
they are less interested in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span>
concerning the previously hidden mysteries of
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Nature</span> which it has been my special business to

unveil as far as possible. To say that the <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">Higher</span>
Occultism, which embraces or includes Theosophy,
does not concern itself with moral problems,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be like saying that the branch of science
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Physics does not concern itself with
electrical phenomena.
So now let me turn to the supremely important
question Professor Lindsay puts impressively with reference to a statement I made about Venus
and Mercury - "How does he know?" Quite
unconsciously he answers his own question when,
intending to be satirical, he says: "Mr. Sinnett
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> appear to have sources of information not
generally available." Precisely so. I first came
into touch with those sources of information in
the year 1879, and a year or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> later wrote a
book, The Occult World, fully detailing the
circumstances under which I obtained that touch,
and some of the intellectual results that ensued
from it. That touch has been maintained to the
present day, and it is hugely important that the
consequent authenticity of Theosophical and
Occult teaching should be properly appreciated.
Explanation of the reasons which led many of us
to trust them in the beginning, and of
experiences confirming that trust in later years,
is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> due not so much to any casual critic
exhibiting hostile incredulity, as to the everincreasing multitudes who are sympathetically
attracted to occult teaching on its own inherent
merits. Already the Theosophical Society, which
does not by any means exhaustively comprehend the
vast movement of Theosophical thought, numbers according to last year's general report - 989
distinct branches or "Lodges" all over the world,
with 26,280 members, leaving "enemy countries"
out of account. In the interest of these - now
constituting the <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> generation of
theosophical members, for I am almost the only
survivor of quite the first generation - as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span>
as in the interest of the far larger numbers who
will assuredly appreciate Theosophical teaching

as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> goes on, it is supremely desirable that
the actuality and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of that "Occult World"
described (very imperfectly) in my first <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">book</span>
should be correctly realized. All <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> on
which our welfare depends must be constantly
<span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> up to date. A conviction once definitely
and justly established in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> ought never to
fade, but for many <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> such convictions
require to be refreshed from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> to time. So, in
reply to an inquiry, which on its own merits
alone need not perhaps have claimed very earnest
treatment, but may have a dull, wide echo if
undealt with, I shall venture to explain once
more "how I know" and what are my sources of
information.
The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> developments, as far as they concerned
myself, began in 1879, and, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> the Professor
thinks that Mme. Blavatsky and the Mahatmas are a
little démodé, the events of that period paved
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> for supremely important results. As
anyone who will read my first <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">book</span> will see, Mme.
Blavatsky exercised abnormal powers. It is futile
to suggest that later on she was accused of
practising imposture. These accusations related
to events occurring <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> after I <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> India. They
are scorned by the multitudes who still reverence
her memory, but it is not my business to deal
with them. The record of her magical doings which
I put forward has never been challenged. Nor can
it be challenged except on the hypothesis that I
am not telling the truth. If <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> occurred
under the circumstances I describe, no possible
theory can be framed to <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> for them except
the theory that she exercised <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> over forces
of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> unknown to science, producing
effects that were a defiance of conventional
beliefs relating to the natural laws governing
matter. No critics of my story accuse me of
intentional falsehood. They <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be laughed at
by the large <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> who know me of they did. They
may accuse me of having been deceived, but that
accusation falls to the ground for all who read

my records, because, if <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> happened as I
describe them, there was no room for deception.
That position could only be established afresh by
a tedious recapitualtion of definite occurrences,
and it is useless for critics to assail it unless
they will refer to the original statements and
show how, under the circumstances, there was room
for imposture. For the moment I must be content
to repeat that such showing is impossible. I was
far more deeply interested at the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> than
anyone can be now, in eliminating from the
experiments I made all possibility of fraud.
Anyhow the result was that I came to know that
Mme. Blavatsky exercised, or was the agent
through whom were exercised, super-normal powers.
That made me inclined to listen to her statement
as to how such powers were obtained. The
statement was to the effect that they were a
relatively feeble reflection of mightier powers
and wider <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> possessed by certain <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> whom
she had personally known - members of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>

even of those representing the progress of

This statement, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> striking and impressive,
did not seem to me incredible. Why should <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span>

should it stop short at the stage represented by
the names quoted? Nor was any mental difficulty
involved in the idea that still loftier stages
had to do with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> - and powers ensuing
from it - that could not desirably be diffused
through the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> at large in its present stage
of development. That is obvious, and it accounted
for the reserve and seclusion of the advanced
"Masters of Wisdom," or, to <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> the favourite

Eastern term, "the Mahatmas." When I began to
write about them, shallow-minded readers fastened
on a story which lent itself to derision, while
more intelligent listeners in large numbers began
to think seriously of "Theosophy," the
comprehensive term assigned to the new views of
natural philosophy opening out before us.
Satisfied myself (to go back to the beginning)
that the exponents of the <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> must
exist, I was eager to get into touch with them and succeeded. First a protracted correspondence
began. How did letters <span class="t6 t9 t13 t15 t17 t18 t23 t28 t29 hoverable">pass</span> between myself and
unknown correspondents, in Himalayian seclusion?
But that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> I knew (see The Occult World) that
occult <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> could transport <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> objects
through space. I found that the "Master" could
"take" my letters by means unfamiliar to the
post, could give me the answers in strange and
unexpected ways. But the "wonder" of this grew
gradually subordinate to the importance of the
communications themselves. Moreover, it was
eclipsed by personal experiences of a supernormal character that put me in closer touch with
the Occult <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">World</span> than that established by the
correspondence. I am now merely sketching the
course of events. To describe them in detail
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> mean re-writing some of my books, but the
sketch will, at any rate, suggest the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of
those "sources of information" which are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span>
my reach, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> "not generally available." And a
moment's reflection will show how reasonable it
is to believe that the "Masters" (to <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> the
Western equivalent for the Indian <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> Mahatma)
are able, if willing, to give such information
concerning the other planets of the Solar System
and its general design as that which I made <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span>
of in my former article¹ for the Nineteenth
Century, and in many books. Common <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> here
amongst us relating to the capacities of our own
clairvoyants (though there are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> claiming to

super-physical science is it surprising that they
should reach out to other worlds of our system?

Again, amongst us everyone following the progress
of modern psychic research will know that it is
possible for the <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> (Soul, Ego, <span class="t3 t11 t18 t27 hoverable">call</span>

good-bye to the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> asleep, and

around us, bringing back recollection of such
excursions when resuming the <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> of the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span>
body. And during such excursions it may be
possible, for those permitted, to have speech
with Masters, as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as with lesser <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span>
entities who have gone through the change <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span>

interest.
There are indeed other ways of gathering in such
teaching, and these have been to some extent at
my service since the far-away <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">days</span> of the
beginning that I have been describing, up to the
present time. I am now in a position to deal,
much more definitely than then, with the
functions of the Masters in connection with the
government of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> and of the stupendous
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Hierarchy to which they belong.
Vast numbers among us are ripe now to appreciate
this revelation, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> other vast numbers are
still intellectually cramped by conventional
prejudice from which they cannot escape, and it
is to those <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> ripe that I venture to address
what remains to be said, rather than to
assailants impatient with the disturbance of
their cherished limitations.

The condition described as Mastership can only be
attained by the sanction of still <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span>
authority, when the moral and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> evolution
of the being in question has reached a condition
which I have described in an earlier writing as
follows:
When he is in a position to survey the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> process on
which the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> family is launched, from its beginning in
the remote past to its conclusion in the almost
immeasurably distant future; when all the natural laws
and forces which play around it lie <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> his
comprehension and grasp, <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> they are operative on
the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> plane with its wonderful complexity of
molecules and forces, or on those other planes invisible
to ordinary sight which interpenetrate it or surround it
and are more bewildering in their complexity still; when
all the myriad enigmas of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> and evil, of <span class="t0 t9 t11 t14 t17 t28 hoverable">sin</span> and
sorrow, and hope, are resolved into intelligible meaning,
and neither the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> below, nor the heavens above, nor
life, nor death, hold any riddles from his understanding,
the Adept is qualified to attain the final rank in the
vast concatenation of progress we have been surveying.

Concurrently with the advance in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> and
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> suggested, the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> has been
correctly described by another writer as
necessarily endowed with "perfect compassion, an
absolutely selfless devotion to the welfare of
all sentient beings, and a boundless <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t8 t13 t15 t17 t18 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> and
fellow-feeling for them all." It has been my
privilige in recent <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> to pick up some bits of
information concerning former lives of some among
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Masters, and these have illustrated
what the writer just quoted meant by absolute
selflessness, in a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> that has thrilled me with
emotion, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> on a <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> level self-sacrifice
is <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> as a <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> of course. How, it may be
asked, can a being on the Master's level be in a
position to incur self-sacrifice? If his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> is
menaced by injury or destruction, he can quit it
at will and assume a new incarnation if he
chooses. Undoubtedly; but <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> he may have been

doing that at intervals (very protracted
intervals) for a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> series of ages, he may
sometimes as a definite duty, to fulfil some
peculiar purpose, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> quite a humbler or
commonplace incarnation in the ordinary world. He
will never in such cases be known as a <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> in
the ordinary world, but he may, for reasons
connected with the welfare of other people,
choose to remain with them and die, even a
painful <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">death</span> in the ordinary way, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> he
might had he chosen have slipped out of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span>
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> incurring the least inconvenience, or, as
Apollonius of Tyana is said to have done when
before Domitian, vanish from sight and remove
himself from danger by occult means. Nor indeed
does the mere exchange of one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> for another
mean any trouble for the Adept of <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> rank. He
can keep any one going for periods measured in
centuries that dazzle our imagination, but in the
course of ages may <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> it convenient to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> new
ones from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> to time. And this <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> alone is
one which will help to dissipate the erroneous
notion prevalent in the beginning of the
Theosophical movement, to the effect that there
was something especially Eastern in the <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span>
Adeptship. The <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> of Occultism is bound by no
limitations of nationality, will be sometimes in
an Eastern as often in a Western incarnation. He
belongs to the World! not to any single section
of its people, however large that section may be.
The main idea in relation to the Masters that I
want to enforce is this: they belong to the
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Hierarchy that presides over the evolution
of mankind, and as regards their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> in guiding
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> progress, as definitely as they are able,
are absolutely at one, in <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> and intention,
with the still <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> agents in that sublime
hierarchy. They may not always <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> it possible
to steer humanity exactly as they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> wish. We,
in this life, collectively constitute a craft
that often fails to answer to the helm. And, as I
endeavoured to explain in a former article

entitled "Our Unseen Enemies and Allies," ¹ we
are terribly mixed up with inimical agencies bent
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> interfering with the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> purpose at every
available opportunity. If it were not for the
ceaseless, untiring efforts of our unknown
protectors to shield us from the consequences of
such attacks, the civilization of the world, the
further evolution of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> race, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span>

For various reasons it is highly desirable that

the Masters render us, in harmony with the
influence of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> hierarchy to which they

however ignorant we might be of the benefits
conferred <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> us. <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> agents do not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> for
reward. But if the <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> is rightly understood
it will be seen that we are the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> who <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span>
be richly rewarded, if we became cognizant of the
benefits conferred, and were, so to speak,
grateful accordingly. It is true, indeed, that if
such gratitude were widely felt and associated
with clear comprehension of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> in which our
Elder Brethen, the Unseen Masters, are struggling
on super-physical planes with the Powers of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Evil</span>

strengthened in the struggle they are carrying
on. Success does not depend on such reinforcement
of strength; that is certain and assured, but the
duration of the struggle, on which the duration
of the War depends, might be to some extent
affected in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> above described.
Meanwhile the more subtle reward we should secure
by gratefully appreciating the protection
afforded us has to do with a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">law</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Nature</span>
familiar to the occultist, and of growing
importance to humanity as evolution proceeds.

Spiritual help of the kind affecting the

to aspiration from the level of this life. We
must look up, in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> that they may look down,
in the manner affecting individual progress. The
progress of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> collectively will go on,
anyhow, when the terrible crisis through which it
is passing is over, because some of us will
assuredly be looking up, and these in the course
of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> will drag on the rest.

acceleration of progress, as regards the upwardlookers themselves, might be more remarkable than
they can readily imagine. Not indeed that such a
spiritually selfish motive ought to be mainly
operative in bringing about the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of feeling
that should prevail. From the point of <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of
the mere occult student on this plane of life, it
is disgusting that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> multitude around us
should be, so to speak, sopping up the benefits

writing would, I fancy, laugh at the notion that
they could be supposed to want gratitude, but
none the less all that I have <span class="t0 t11 t24 hoverable">written</span> above holds
good, and anyhow I know that they are eager to
help all who are ready to be helped, and
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> are more than pleased when such help is
consciously invoked. At earlier stages of the
world's growth they had to remain concealed. The
stake and the torture chambers of the Church
awaited those who tried to proclaim any <span class="t4 t7 t12 t16 hoverable">faith</span>
nobler than that of the priests. The Masters had
to bide their time. But their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> has now come.

incredulous who were formerly dreaded in their belief,

supine in the conviction that our conduct will neither be

useful, to the profane multitude of mankind.

THE OCCULTISM IN TENNYSON'S POETRY
A FEW among the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> host of his devotees who,
besides appreciating the varied beauties of
Tennyson's poetry, are in touch with modern
developments of the <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">Higher</span> Occultism, will be
alive to the significance of some hints scattered
through his writings showing how he, in advance
of modern developments, intuitively divined some
important principles now emerging from obscurity
into the light. Even highly cultured and
appreciative readers, unless also students of
occultism, may <span class="t6 t9 t13 t15 t17 t18 t23 t28 t29 hoverable">pass</span> them by unnoticed. Sir Alfred
Lyall, for example, in his generally admirable
survey of Tennyson's work, contributed to the
series of "English <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Men</span> of Letters," overlooks
some glaring hints of the kind in question, while
actually dealing with the mere literary charm of
one poem mainly devoted to the present
elucidation of occult ideas.
The elucidation of the passages <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> hinting at
hitherto hidden mysteries of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Nature</span> is
the purpose of the present article, but it must
not be held to imply that the writer seeks to
enrol Tennyson in the ranks of professed
occultists. Of course, the splendour of his
genius shone chiefly in his treatment of purely
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> emotion. And we, who have passed through
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> <span class="t6 hoverable">side</span> by <span class="t6 hoverable">side</span> with the poetic stream of his
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span> that flowed through the greater part of
the last century, have derived our most intense
pleasure from the perfection of his earlier
verse, apart from the beauty of the thoughts it
conveyed. Then came the Idylls of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span> in
their stately magnificence, but they have nothing
to do with occultism. A truly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> poet can
never be a specialist in any one vein of
creation, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> in whatever vein he is
following, Tennyson seems for the moment to be a
specialist in that. The Lady of Shalott, The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Day</span>
Dream, The Lotos-Eaters, and many others of that
period, surpass in their musical charm any

previous <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">verse</span> in English literature, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span>
Byron and Moore sometimes touched the same level.
And the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> in which Locksley Hall might be
criticized, like Hamlet, as "full of
quotations," shows how Tennyson was a specialist
among poets in coining phrases that linger in
universal memory, while the Idylls of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span>
lead some of us to forget that the supreme <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span>
of blank <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">verse</span> was equally unrivalled in dealing
with rhyme. But after all, however highly we may
appreciate his art, that merely renderd the
surface worthy of the substance of his poetry.
So much in advance to show that the interest some
of us may <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> in the flashes of occult
inspiration to be discerned in Tennyson's poems
need not separate us from the sympathy of
worshipers who live in a more familiar
atmosphere. Nor from the point of <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of occult
students, who have profited by the flood of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span>
let in of late on mysteries previously obscure,
will the flashes in question show that Tennyson
was completely in possession of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> which

to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">death</span> and the hereafter in In Memoriam are
hardly tinged with any philosophy deeper than
ordinary religious feeling, and in The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Two</span> Voices

comfortless reasoning of the first, offers merely
A little hint to solace Woe A hint, a whisper breathing low,

a mere "hidden hope." And <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> the same poem
contains a <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> that might almost be reckoned
among the flashes of inspiration, suggesting the

It may be that no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> is found,
Which only to one engine bound
Falls off, but cycles always round.
As old mythologies relate,
Some draught of Lethe might await
The slipping thro' from <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> to state.
As here we <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> in trances, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span>
Forget the dream that happens then,
Until they fall in trance again.

I need not expand the quotation. The poem from
which it comes will be familiar to all
Tennysonian enthusiasts, and the <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> to which
I <span class="t3 t11 t18 t27 hoverable">call</span> attention embodies a <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> far more
fully treated in later utterances; but before
dealing with them it is worth while to turn back
to one of his very earliest fragments entitled
The Mystic, <span class="t0 t11 t24 hoverable">written</span> when Tennyson could not have
been more than seventeen, and to be found, I
think, in one edition of the Poems by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Two</span>
Brothers. It begins:
Angels have talked with him and shown him thrones,
Ye knew him not, he was not one of ye,
Ye scorned him with an undiscerning scorn,
Ye could not read the marvel in his eye,
The still serene abstraction he <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hath</span> felt.

we come to the final lines, which are as follows:
How could ye know him? Ye were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span>

The last which with a region of white flame

Upburning and an ether of black blue

fifteen. Everyone familiar with the principle of
Reincarnation will readily understand that so
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> a poet as Tennyson must have been a poet

over the capacity for poetic expression, so that
inspiration, merely conveying an idea, could rely
on the new personality to clothe it in
appropriate language. Thus, although the ideas
underlying The Mystic can hardly be regarded as
originating in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> of a boy of seventeen,

his own.
The description of The Mystic is not appropriate
to any one on the ordinary plane of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> to whom

not have any characteristics resembling those
described in the poem. Those are the

race - now generally spoken of as the Masters of
Wisdom, of whom - since they themselves have
communicated more freely than in former times
with the ordinary plane of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> - we have come to

writers with ideas for them to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> up in the
progress of literature, art, and science is now
clearly realized by their pupils in occultism.
Conventional thinking has hitherto made at once
too much and too little of inspiration. It has
been conceived as only of very rare occurrence in

connection with writings of a sacred character,
its frequency being <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> very limited, while its
source is <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> of as altogether Divine. It is
really of constant occurrence and emanates from
all levels of the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Hierarchy. The extent to
which writers and artists (those with some lofty
purpose in their work) are "helped" by invisible
beings, on a <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> plane of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> than their own,
can hardly be exaggerated, so there is indeed
little <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> to be surprised at finding a
youthful poet of Tennyson's promise under
inspiration from a very early period.
But the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> was not ripe in the year 1826 for
the gift of any detailed information concerning
the actual constitution of the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Hierarchy,
with its varied levels of dignity and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> and
intricate agencies. In 1892, towards the close of
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> poet's life, conditions had changed in
a very remarkable degree. And the flashes of
inspiration to which Tennyson lent himself then
became wonderfully distinct. A few verses to be
found in the volume published in that year, and
entitled By an Evolutionist, are deeply
suggestive. We read as follows:
The

then I will let you a better."

Occult students will recognize in these few lines
a flood of significant allusion. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> alone
may have no deep <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> for readers unfamiliar
with the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> principles hinted at, but for
those who know more they are richly significant.
They include, to begin with, the fundamental idea
that humanity is evolved from humbler animal
life, and beyond this they recognize the method
of that evolution - the transfer of <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">Consciousness</span>
from Lower to <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">Higher</span> Vehicles as the consequence
of its own craving for the higher. They recognize

more than that indeed - a deep and supremely
important idea concerning the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of
consciousness. This is one of the latest
developments of advanced occult teaching.
<span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">Consciousness</span> - that supreme mystery that baffles
all physiological research - is uniform in its
character throughout all manifestations of life.
There is only one kind of consciousness: that of
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> and of the animal <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span> is the
same throughout. Its effective value depends on
the vehicle in which it is working. In the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span>
of an animal it has greatly expanded capacities.
In the vehicles of <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> belonging to
<span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> planes it finds these capacities again
expanded to an extent which ordinary humanity, at
the average stage reached in this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> at the
present time, cannot even grasp in imagination.
At every stage of the process the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">law</span> works.
Any given volume of <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> any
given vehicle, gradually becoming an
individuality, establishes a claim on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Nature</span> for
an improved vehicle, by making the best possible
<span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> of the one it has got. "Make it as clean as
you can, and then I will let you a better."
We can understand the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">law</span> best by concentrating
attention on humanity first. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> at an early

heights of achievement. He may be fit for little
more than the rougher manual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> of <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span>
life. But being by that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> a man, he has - if
only a glimmering - perception of the difference
between right and wrong. He follows the guidance
of this perception. He makes the vehicle of his
<span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> (which is himself) "as clean as he
can." In his next incarnation he infallibly
acquires "a better." <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">verse</span> above quoted,
among other ideas, clearly recognizes the
principle of Reincarnation, which Tennyson
evidently accepted <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> reserve and worked

over.

In writing this Tennyson was evidently
concentrating <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> on the idea of rebirth and
the recovery of the love-relations of the
previous life. Even if the intervening period
were merely a sleep the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> Ego <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> reappear
in the awakening life. The more scientific <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span>
of reincarnation, of course - while confidently
recognizing that idea - realizes the immense
importance of the intervening <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> on <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span>
planes. Sometimes, indeed, if the Ego is at a
humble stage of its expansion, the intervening
period, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> restful and happy, is little
better than a blissful sleep. In others it
affords magnificent opportunities for the
cultivation of intellectual or artistic capacity.
True, such growth can only <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> as a
consequence of some effective seed of aspiration
or effort sown in the previous <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> life, but
even minute seeds of that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> are nuclei from
which splendid consequences may ensue, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> in

and even minor friendships dating back to the
past. The disregard of this important aspect of
the subject operates to render the idea of
reincarnation unattractive to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> who
understand it imperfectly. They think of

were. This is a ridiculous misapprehension of the
natural law. A moment's <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> should show that
probability points to the idea that generations
living about the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> will - on the average

- get through their intervening lives on <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span>
planes, and be ready for reincarnation at about
the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> later on. Where personal ties of
<span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t8 t13 t15 t17 t18 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> or even less powerful affinities associate
Egos together, their return <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> becomes a
<span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> of certainty. Adequately trained
clairvoyance is equal to the task of verifying
that principle, and tracing back, even through
ages in the past, the former lives of living
people.
Whenever genuine mutual affection unites <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span>
on this plane of life, they are always found to
have been in affectionate relationship in former
lives also. There may have been considerable
differences in intellectual growth even, but the
love-tie is supreme, and the ingenuity of the
natural <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">law</span> - or of those who guide the natural

and to much more complicated problems of
"Karma" - the convenient term which embraces,
among other meanings, the necessity that moral
causes engendered in one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> shall reap their
appropriate consequences in lives of later date.
Now let us turn to the last <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">verse</span> of the brief
poem, of which the first has been quoted above:
I have climb'd to the snows of Age, and I gaze at a field
in the Past,
Where I sank with the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> at times in the sloughs of a
low desire,
But I hear no yelp of the beast, and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Man</span> is quiet at
last
As he stands on the heights of his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> with a glimpse of
a height that is higher.

The last few <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> of the last line - "a glimpse
of a height that is higher" - hint unmistakably
at the sublime possibilities of Initiation. There
is no finality in the vast process of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span>
evolution, but there are recognizable stages. The
perfect <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Man</span> has reached one of those stages, from

which he looks forward to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> attainment
transcending any condition that can be limited by
the term humanity. I need not attempt to
elaborate that idea; but we shall see <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> to
believe that the poet knew more of the height
that is <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> than he found it possible to put
into words.
The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">law</span> under which <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> in
humanity seeks and secures better and better
vehicles operates also throughout the lower
kingdoms. It is not easily traced through animal
and vegetable manifestations, but even faintly
understood it illuminates the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> doctrine of
Evolution. Occult students at one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> were
inclined to <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> fault with the Darwinian
presentation of the idea, as ignoring the
evolution of <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> going on concurrently
with the evolution of form. We see now that the
evolution of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> defines the evolution of
consciousness. <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">Consciousness</span> is very far from
being a mere attribute of the form, as some
materialistic scientists of the last century
imagined, but the expression of its infinite
capacities depends on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> in which it is
working. This <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of the subject is worthy of
protracted treatment; but there are other poems
that claim examination.
A little fragment - merely <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> verses - entitled
The Making of Man, is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> worth attention, but
does not do more that reiterate some of the ideas
in the verses last discussed. It recognizes the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of the tiger and the ape as necessarily
manifesting in humanity at first, but
Prophet-eyes may catch a <span class="t0 t7 t21 t27 hoverable">glory</span> slowly gaining on the
shade,
Till the peoples all are one and all their voices blend
in choric
Hallelujah to the Maker - "It is finished. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Man</span> is made."

We may now turn to the poem which is the fullest
expression of occult inspiration among all that
suggest that origin - The Ancient Sage. This,
indeed, includes evidence showing that Tennyson
in his own <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> had attained to definite
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> relating to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> conditions far
transcending those familiar to the average
humanity of our period. The Ancient Sage was
published in the volume entitled "Tiresias and
other Poems," just preceding the latest of all "Demeter and other Poems." The "Sage," obviously
a <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> of Wisdom, criticises a "scroll" by a
young companion who has embodied sceptical,
almost materialistic, views in very graceful
verse. The scroll recognizes that "the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> is
fair in hue,"
But <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> to-day is fancy's fool
As <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hath</span> ever been.
The nameless Power, or Powers, that rule
Were never <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> or seen.

The <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> comments on this:
If <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thou</span> wouldst hear the Nameless, and wilt dive
Into the Temple-cave of <span class="t6 t13 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">thine</span> own self,
There, brooding by the central altar, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thou</span>
Mayst haply learn the Nameless <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hath</span> a voice,
By which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thou</span> wilt abide, if <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thou</span> be wise.

The scroll still quarrels with the mystery.
And since - from when this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> began The Nameless never came
Among us, never spake with man,
And never named the Name.

And the Sage answers with almost the best <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span>
in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> poem:

After a <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> in the scroll relating to the
darkness and miseries of life, the Sage replies:
Who knows but that the darkness is in man?
The doors of Night may be the gates of Light;
For wert <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thou</span> <span class="t16 t24 hoverable">born</span> or blind or deaf, and then
Suddenly heal'd, how wouldst <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thou</span> <span class="t0 t7 t21 t27 hoverable">glory</span> in all
The splendours and the voices of the world!

And this leads up to the most striking <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> in
the poem, in which the Sage - in this <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span>
Tennyson himself - got "out of the body," to <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span>
a phrase familiar to occult students, by adopting
a method with which they are quite familiar. This
consists of self-induced hypnotism <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> on by
repeating - alone and aloud - one's own name. The
repetitions may have to be very numerous, running
perhaps into hundreds, and even then the effort
may be futile unless the <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> making it has
some psychic potentialities in his nature. But
granting that last condition, it is an effective
process, and one which Tennyson seems to have
been almost in the habit of using. His reference
to it in the poem before us is as follows:
for more than once when I
Sat all alone, revolving in myself
The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> that is the symbol of myself,

The mortal limit of the Self was loosed,
And past into the Nameless, as a cloud
Melts into Heaven. I touched my limbs, the limbs
Were strange not mine - and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> no shade of doubt,
But utter clearness, and thro' loss of Self
The gain of such large <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> as match'd with ours
Were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Sun</span> to spark - unshadowable in words,
Themselves but shadows of a shadow world.

I cannot identify any other allusion in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span>
range of Tennyson's poetry that directly relates
to experiences of this nature, but in the Memoir
his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Son</span> tells us that
in some phases of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> and feeling his idealism tended
more decidedly to mysticism. He wrote: "A kind of waking
trance I have frequently had quite up from boyhood when I
have been all alone. This has generally come <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> me

myself silently, till all at once, as it were out of the
intensity of the <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> of individuality, the
individuality itself seemed to dissolve and fade away
into a boundless being, and this not a confused <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> but
the clearest of the clearest, the surest of the surest,
the weirdest of the weirdest, utterly beyond words, where
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">death</span> was an almost laughable impossibility, the loss of
personality (if so it were) seeming no extinction but the
only <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> life! This might be said to be the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> which
St. Paul describes, 'Whether in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> I cannot tell,
or <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> out of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> I cannot tell!'" He continued:
"I am ashamed of my feeble description. Have I not said
the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> is utterly beyond words? But in a moment when I
come back to my normal <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of 'sanity' I am ready to
fight for mein liebes Ich and hold that it will last for
aeons of aeons." In the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> he said that there might
be a more intimate communion than we could dream of
between the living and the dead, at all events for a
time.

So the spiritualists may fairly claim Tennysonian
sanction for the fundamental principle of their
belief, which indeed is quite in harmony with the
views of advanced occult students, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> some of
early date were misled into a needlessly hostile
mistrust of the system, apt in some cases to be
itself rather misleading, but which - as broadly

designed to assure a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> drifting at one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span>
into materialsim that there is another <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> after
this, and so on - was a generous gift to
civilization from levels of <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> wisdom.
Readers of the Memoir will derive, from a very
unexpected source, confirmation of the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that
Tennyson made frequent <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> of the repeated-name
method of attaining <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> illumination. It
appears that the author asked Professor Tyndall
to make some contribution to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> in hand. In
the course of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> answer he says:
I looked up the <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of my first visit to Farringford,
and there to my profound astonishment I found described
that experience of your father's which, in the mouth of
the Ancient Sage, was made the ground of an important
argument against materialism and in favour of personal
immortality eight-and-twenty <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> afterwards. . . . If
you turn to your father's <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the wonderful <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span>
of <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> super-induced by thinking of his own
name and compare it with the argument of the Ancient Sage
you will see that they refer to one and the same
phenomenon.

Each injunction will be familiar to readers of
theosophical books, and a fortiori to all
students of the <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">Higher</span> Occultism, and that last
phrase, "Do-well will follow thought," is an
almost amusing reflection of a more elaborate
doctrine <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> forth in certain manuals that
profess to guide candidates for initiation in the
<span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> mysteries. They are told first to purify
thought, and secondly to purify conduct. From the
commonplace point of <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> that seems putting the
cart before the horse, but action may sometimes
be thoughtless, and then if it were avoided for
no definite <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> probably be repeated

preceded its avoidance, the cure <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be
permanent.
It is needless to carry on further the search for
occult allusions in Tennyson's poetry. Fainter
hints, in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> of those already quoted,
might be pointed out in poems less definitely
infused with occult inspiration than The Ancient
Sage, but the broad conclusion to be derived from
them all is sufficiently <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> established. The
deeper mysteries of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> were still

part of Tennyson's splendid literary activity. It
was not his task to tear down the veil
completely, nor did the rifts he made in it here
and there afford his readers anything resembling
that scientific comprehension of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> natural
truths lying behind it which many of us have
ultimately reached. This attainment inaugurates a
new era of thought. But Tennyson intuitively
forecast the revelation impending. And perhaps

for the cultured classes of this period, slow
hitherto to appreciate the significance of the

CREEDS MORE OR LESS CREDIBLE
SINCE the amusing period when Bishop Colenso
discovered that the hare does not chew the cud as the author of the Pentateuch had supposed the "Allegory," on the banks of the Nile and
elsewhere, has been busy chewing the primitive
<span class="t4 t7 t12 t16 hoverable">faith</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> previously content to accept
statements in the Bible as necessarily true, even
when somewhat surprising. Tempers were often lost
during the discussions of the Colenso and Darwin
days, but Allegory has proved a more goodhumoured beast than he was <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> to be at
first, so that critics and the Church can give
and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> now with a superficial pretence of being
friends in reality. Beyond this, indeed, the
attitudes of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> on both sides are undergoing
change. The ribald scoffer is extinct. The D.D.
who still attributes the sufferings of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span>
to Eve's conversation with the Serpent hides
quietly in cathedral towns. Science and Theology
are on the terms that Talleyrand described as
established between himself and the Host, when he
raised his hat to a Roman Catholic procession:
"Nous nous saluons mais nous ne parlons pas." And
happily these relations are still improving.
Science, of the old materialistic order, has had
to endure many shocks of late. A police
magistrate some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> ago refused to believe
overwhelming testimony in favour of a
spiritualist medium on the ground that it was
contrary to the known laws of Nature. The members
of the Royal <span class="t1 hoverable">Society</span> are no longer so sure of
having completely catalogued those laws. And the
doubt makes them even respectful to the theory of
miracles. After all, turning <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> into wine is
child's play compared with the miracle
accomplished whenever artificial incubation turns
an egg into a chicken. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">People</span> who still
disbelieve in the phenomena of genuine
spiritualism - as puzzling as any records in
Christian story - must guard their ignorance very
carefully if they wish to preserve their

opinions. Science in all directions is
negotiating with the unseen, and the <span class="t8 t12 t17 hoverable">wise</span>
churchman realizes that some concessions on his
part may lead to a settle peace, promising
protection for institutions and substantial
interests he sometimes felt to be in danger from
the battering ram. Already there is an entente
more or less cordiale between the enlightened
<span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">Free</span> Thinker - shedding the folly of denying
whatever he does not understand - and the
churchman who knows that he must adapt his <span class="t4 t7 t12 t16 hoverable">faith</span>
to the uniformites of Nature, that it is often
unsafe to insist that "sacred" writings always
mean what they seem to say.
But questions have arisen that are more
embarrassing than the reconciliation of Scripture
with obvious <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> facts. And these challenge
statements that cannot <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> sanctuary in any
theory of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> inspiration. The language of the
Creeds must at all events be ascribed to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span>
authorship. This is complicated and to some
extent obscure, but in criticizing the Creeds we
are not in trouble with any theory of verbal
inspiration from <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> levels. The Revised
Version of the Bible - humbly attempting to
correct a few gross errors of translation - has
(according to a familiar anecdote) been treated
with faint praise by a sturdy exponent of the
early <span class="t4 t7 t12 t16 hoverable">faith</span> who preferred "God's own words." But
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> adopted to define Christian belief at
Nicæa in A.D.325 were simply those of certain
bishops, who prevailed over other bishops
desirous of using different words, so we cannot
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> inspiration into the story. Again, the
Nicene Creed was preceded by an extensive "creed
literature" - to <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> the phrase of an orthodox
writer, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be scarcely possible now
to identify any writing as the first attempt to
put Christian belief on paper. Nor does the
importance of the subject at the present <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span>

arising is this: Do the Creeds, as they are put

into the mouths of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> who attend church at
the present day, express beliefs they can
possibly be expected to entertain? The question
may fairly be described as having arisen, because
it has been recently the subject of
correspondence in The Times. Canon Glazebrook in
a <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">book</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> The <span class="t4 t7 t12 t16 hoverable">Faith</span> of a Modern Churchman

rose again from the dead" - can legitimately be
interpreted "symbolically." The Bishop of Ely, in
a letter addressed to Canon Glazebrook and also
published in The Times, refuses to accept this
view, and supports his refusal by quoting a
resolution adopted by "the bishops of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span>

record its conviction that the historical facts
stated in the Creeds are an essential part of the
<span class="t4 t7 t12 t16 hoverable">faith</span> of the Church." Canon Glazebrook, in a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span>
letter published in The Times of May 21, does not
argue the question on its merits but quotes
episcopal sayings that deprecate undue
limitations on freedom of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> and inquiry,
and attributes to the Bishop of Oxford a <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of
the Ascension which he summarizes in this way:
"Our <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> could not, for astronomical reasons of
which the disciples were ignorant, physically
ascend into Heaven. But in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> give to them a
right conception of His change of <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> He rose
to a moderate height in the air, and then so
veiled Himself behind a cloud that they believed
Him to have gone right up into the vault of the
sky." If the Bishop is fairly represented by this
summary the suggestion needs expansion. What was
the later course of events? When our Lord, having
deluded His disciples in the manner described,
wanted to come down again, how did He conceal His
reappearance? But while the Bishop's hypothesis
tempts further comment, this might seem wanting
in due reverence for the main idea concerned, so

no more on that subject need be said for the
moment.
And <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> that line of speculation in reference to
alleged occurrences that outrage common sense, is
one into which it is easy to be driven if <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span>
are content to think of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Nature</span> as simply

intangible as Thought, out of relation with Space
or Time, <span class="t22 t23 t28 hoverable">offering</span> nothing to the imagination that
can prefigure a future existence, except of a
kind to be spoken of with bated breath and
avoided as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> as possible. Only for those,
happily a large and increasing number, who
comprehended more or less completely the
intervening conditions of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Nature</span> lying between
the dense manifestation of the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> plane and
the "incomprehensible" (though not less real)
conditions of exalted planes - only by virtue of
their superior enlightenment is it possible to
get rid - first of the dread commonly connected
with the process of passing on, and secondly of
the embarrassment arising from occasional
occurrences which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> such enlightenment must
either be disbelieved in defiance of evidence or
dealt with by some grotesquely foolish
explanation.
That idea applies very forcibly to the study of
the Creeds. The writers who reduced them to their
present shape may have been using <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> plane
language in a metaphorical sense, or they may
simply have swallowed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> hesitation
statements absurd on their face. But in either
<span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> we have to recognize, in the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> of modern
occult knowledge, that somewhere in the back
history of the Creeds such <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> must have
been in the possession of some <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> or persons
who inspired the earliest writers on the subject.
And we reach, with the same confidence, the
conclusion that current versions of the Creeds

have been the product of painfully clumsy
editing. Such <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> could only have been carried
out properly by editors saturated with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span>
of natural conditions unseen by the multitude,
while the actual editors were certainly not of
that type. As a mere first illustration of that
idea we may <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> the few <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> in the Apostles'

pay attention first to the ritual adopted in
ancient <span class="t28 hoverable">Egypt</span> in connection with initiation in
the Mysteries, ages before the Christian era. The
candidate lay down on a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> wooden cross
hollowed out so as to support the figure; was
bound on it (quite loosely so as to suggest the
voluntary character of the sacrifice) and then
was put (mesmerically) into a deep trance which
involved the emergence from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> of his real
<span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> in the astral form. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> was
then deposited in a sarcophagus, to typify

burial. In the astral <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> the real entity was
confronted with varied experiences educating him
in the idea that he - the real entity - was
beyond the reach of injury from fire, water, or
even the subtler perils of the under-world. Then,
on the <span class="t7 hoverable">third</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> was <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> up
into the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> of the sunrise, and its
"resurrection" - the return to it of the real Ego
- was accomplished.
Followed out more closely, the Egyptian ceremony
included other super-physical suggestions that
may have been in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> of those who sketched
the earliest draft of the Creed. Before being
awakened the candidate had touch, out of the
body, with sublime levels of consciousness, as
definitely an ascent into <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heaven</span> as the underworld experiences were a descent into hell. The
under-world in question is, of course, only a
part, a low subdivision, of the enormous astral
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> that surrounds the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> globe, and is
growing familiar in these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">days</span> to many explorers.
Its loftier realms are widely expanded regions
that provide for happy conditions of life, and
for happy conditions as varied as there are
variations, amongst <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> still in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of
aspirations pointing to happiness.
How did it come to <span class="t6 t9 t13 t15 t17 t18 t23 t28 t29 hoverable">pass</span> that allusions to the
ritual of the Egyptian Mysteries found their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span>
into the Christian Creed? To frame a conjecture
we must begin by realizing that the Egyptian
ceremonial was itself an allegory based on
fundamental ideas connected with the science of
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> evolution - fully understood by those who
invented the ritual. We can see this hinting at
the ordeal of suffering incidental to the
<span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> life, at the possibility of further
suffering in the under-world as the penalty of
evil-doing here, at the restful touch with
happier conditions (the ascent into heaven), at
the return to Earth-life after this - the
resurrection or more literally the reincarnation

of the Ego. Whoever infused into that early
"creed literature" the first suggestion for a
formula of belief must have had the Egyptian
allegory in his mind, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> with a perfect
comprehension of its deep meaning, as also
embodied in the Christian story.
For many reasons besides those that have to do
with the illumination of the Creeds, it is
deplorable that the clergy at large do not avail
themselves of growing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> concerning the
unseen worlds, which might enable them in turn to
become more or less competent <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> teachers.
Some few are emerging from the stagnant majority,
but for the rest to pose as experts in dealing
with the interests of humanity lying outside
those of the current life, while remaining
ignorant of all that is now becoming known
concerning the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> hereafter, is like claiming
to practice as a doctor <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> knowing more

barber-surgeons of the Middle Ages. Even the
humblest spiritualist has realized that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span>
hereafter is accessible to investigation. He may
investigate very clumsily. His grasp even of the
main idea may be very incomplete, but he knows
that he is in touch with another plane of
existence; that death, for all decent <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> is

than that which the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> plane provides for
as a rule. The average clergyman, meanwhile, will
not avail himself of the means by which he - with
a more cultivated <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> - might not only realize
this much, but expand his comprehenson of the
ultimate <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> possibilities awaiting
humanity, to an enormous extent. If it were not
so profoundly distressing there <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be
something supremely ludicrous in the spectacle of
a vast organisation, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> raison d'être is the

thought, resolutely keeping aloof from avenues of
research provided by abundant experience to be
richly stored with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t12 t20 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">wisdom</span> for all who

explore them.
This <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of the <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> will become more and more
impressive when attention is turned to those
passages in the Creeds which relate to the Virgin
Birth. For those who can only think in terms of
<span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> plane matter, the Virgin Birth seems to
strain imagination less than an ascent to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heaven</span>
by a tangible flesh-and-blood Christ. Birth of
any sort is a mystery. A virgin birth <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be
only a little more mysterious than one of the
ordinary kind. But the first <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> that
suggests a pause for reflection arises from the
undeniable <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that other religions before
Christianity claim virgin births for their
founders. Is this merely due to a pious <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> in
each <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> to dignify the origin of the founder,
or can it bear a more intricate explanation? This
is certainly the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> in reference to the
adaptation of the familiar doctrine to the
Christian story. To get at the actual <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span>
hinted at metaphorically by the virgin birth
idea, we must go rather deeply into modern
developments of super-physical science.
By its help we are enabled to recognize the
creative achievement, when a Solar system comes
into existence, as involving successive
processes: first the formation of molecular
<span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> from the atomic raw material pervading all
space. We need not talk about the origin of that,
any more than about the beginning of eternity.
But a Solar System has a beginning and a destiny.
It is an episode in eternity, and the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span> of
a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> is an episode <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the enormously
protracted <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of a Solar System. Molecular
<span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> constituting in its various aspects the
chemical elements (as they <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> to be called)
becomes available for the formation of a globe
destined to be a living planet. We see the
process still going on in the growth of nebulæ
with which the heavens abound. At a later stage
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> pours out from itself the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span>

principle. The vegetable and animal kingdoms come
into existence. Later, again, when the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span>
stage is reached, a further emanation from
divinity invests definite <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> with what is
sometimes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> "the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Spark," with that
which renders such <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> immortal, capable of
developing through successive Earth-lives the
loftier attributes of intellect and spirituality.
The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> stages are described by many phrases:
sometimes as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> waves of Atmic influence;
sometimes as the first, second, and <span class="t7 hoverable">third</span> Logos;
sometimes as the Father, Son, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Holy</span> Ghost.
Now when we attempt to see how this <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span> affects the language of the Apostles'
and Nicene Creeds, we have to keep in touch with
another line of thought. The history of the
Creeds points to a definite <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> origin, but the
hints their language embodies point (as already
suggested) to inspiration from a lofty source of
wisdom; while it also betrays the corruption of
such hints as successive versions have been
prepared. Lofty <span class="t12 t20 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">wisdom</span> has always lain hidden in
the <span class="t13 t23 hoverable">hands</span> of the Elder Brethen of the race, who
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> knew that primitive conditions of
civilization <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> not allow of its general
diffusion.
The general diffusion, however, of large extracts
from it is now in progress, taking shape in the
<span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">Higher</span> Occultism of recent years. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> we can now
discern in much ancient writing of a religious
character the streak of inspiration and the
superposed blundering of unenlightened
transmitters of the inspiration. The <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> in
the Apostles' Creed about the Virgin Birth is a
thrilling example of both influences. The
adjective "virgin" has been applied in very
ancient literature to matter, as due to the
action of the First Logos, or the first creative
wave. Only when - after intervening development it is touched with the <span class="t7 hoverable">Third</span> Logos (or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Holy</span>
Ghost) can it engender the <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Christ</span> principle. That

idea gets twisted, by primitive ignorance capable
only of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> along the lines of the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span>
senses, into the idea of a conception by a woman
<span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> of the conditions that generally give rise
to conception. And then in the Nicene Creed we
get the gross misunderstanding developed into the
unfortunate expression, "the only-begotten <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Son</span> of
God."
How does this subtle interpretation of the
familiar language fit in with the Gospel story
which the Creeds seem to follow? The literal
accuracy of that story has been challenged by
critics who <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> to miracles, and nothing that
can be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> contemporary authentic history
affords it any sanction; but from the occult
point of <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> - that is to say, from the point of
<span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> that relies on something much
more trustworthy than <span class="t0 t11 t24 hoverable">written</span> history - the story
is contemplated in a deeply reverential spirit,
but is not treated throughout as a mere record of
occurrences. The occultist has resources at his
disposal when investigating the past that leave
mere literary research panting in the rear. The
principle is intelligible to all who appreciate
the significance of clairvoyance, in some of its
suggestive developments. One kind enables the
clairvoyant to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> cognizance of events going on
at the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> in some distant place. Another kind
deals with events distant in past time. There is
a memory of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Nature</span> in which some clairvoyants can

The bundle of miscellaneous statements at the end
of the Apostles' Creed, and also imbedded in the
Nicene Creed, need not claim much attention
except so far as "the resurrection of the body"
has been a stumbling-block for all who realize
the gross absurdity of the phrase in its plain
meaning, and may not understand that the astral

to deal with a blend of <span class="t12 t20 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">wisdom</span> and folly that is

a position to reconstruct the teaching
ludicrously caricatured by the language of the

blasphemous absurdities and show it to have been
originally inspired by profound <span class="t12 t20 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">wisdom</span> and
knowledge.
Summarized as it stands it consists of a series

to believe them both ways will be damned. "Perish
everlastingly" is the expression <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> at first,
but a reference later to "everlasting fire"
invests it with more specific meaning. To avoid
this fate we have to believe a string of
assertions frankly described as incomprehensible.

the gibberish of the Athanasian Creed as it
stands, the profoundly scientific ideas that some

is this: some <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> their <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> will to accomplish
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> progress of infinite importance. Others
neglect their opportunities so persistently that
they are <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> behind; not doomed to any horrible

incomprehensible - i.e., beyond its grasp.

adapted to express Egos of similar advancement.
What is to be done, by the Powers that guide and
control incarnations, with the Egos that have
been so neglectful of their past opportunities
that they are not fit to animate the bodies of
the kind that are being born? The Powers in
question - and for the occultist they are

consequence of their own neglect incurred the
inevitable necessity of beginning again. They are
not destined to perish everlastingly, but they
are thrown back in evolution for a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> period.
All Oriental writings - and our "sacred"

about, and not as we do - with a specific
mathematical idea behind them.
Vastly more than the difficulty of reconciling
the triple aspect of Divinity with the essential
unity <span class="t23 t28 hoverable">thereof</span> is hinted at by the inspirer of the
Athanasian Creed, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> clumsy interpreters have

IMPRISONED IN THE FIVE SENSES
THE "Palace of Art" was replete with interest and
charm for its mistress up to a certain stage in
her <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> evolution; but a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> came when she
found herself - <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> still in its luxurious
magnificence Shut up as in a crumbling tomb, girt round
With blackness as a solid wall.

An emotion loftier than the thirst for pleasure
constrained her to break away from its
limitations, and to "purge her guilt" in a wider
atmosphere of sympathy with her kind.
Tennyson's poetry is so <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span> of <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> below the
surface that one is tempted to discern a deep
allegorical significance in the lines just quoted
over and above their obvious bearing on the plain
problems of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> - on selfishness and
sympathy. For all humanity at the present period
of its progress is shut in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the shining
walls of its gorgeous artistic and scientific
Palace, the contents sufficing amply for its
needs, as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> as it is satisfied to ignore all
that lies beyond. The walls of the Palace are the
senses, inherent in the vehicles of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> on the

avenues to <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> they are not windows
through which we gaze out into infinity, but dead
walls confining our survey of Nature's mysteries
to one aspect only of their manifold variety.
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Human</span> <span class="t14 t24 hoverable">intelligence</span> of the usual type is, in
truth, imprisoned in the five senses, although in
the front already stand a few who have developed
new senses which reveal the <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> of worlds
beyond worlds in endless series, and, as turned
back on the past show modern civilization but
just emerging from conditions analogous to
childhood.

The character of the change achieved by those
illuminated by new senses may best be
comprehended by focussing imagination on the
condition of a <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> <span class="t16 t24 hoverable">born</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> the most

deal with the fruit of the familiar senses. Of
course <span class="t4 t7 t12 t16 hoverable">faith</span> and imagination seem to yield much
more, but are cramped by the familiar senses - as
shown by some ludicrous features of
anthropomorphic religion. For practical purposes
the senses are the channels through which we gain
knowledge. When we guess or speculate along other
channels, the mental conception of one generation
is apt to be thrown aside by the next, and the
history of Philosophy becomes an amusing cinema

and there is not much beauty about it.
By far the most important discoveries which
reward the efforts of those who escape from the
imprisonment of the senses have to do with the
definite possibilities of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> progress

sense-perceptions seem to define. Grant anyone

be previously. I will illustrate this statement
by describing a scientific research carried on
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the last few <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> by means of superphysical senses, and happily involving something
like a self-contained proof of its conclusions.
It began under my own guidance, when working with
a friend brilliantly endowed with super-physical
senses. I had found that, quite independently of
results they gave us in reference to <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span>
conditions of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> beyond the change <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span>
death, they were ultra-microscopic in their
character as applied to <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> nature. Could
they be so applied as to enable my friend to see
an ultimate molecule of <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> matter? The
magnitude of such molecules is so minute that
mathematical calculations with which, among
others, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> name <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> Kelvin is associated,
lead to the conclusion that thirty trillion
molecules of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> are included in the volume of
a cubic centimetre. My friend undertook to try,
and I suggested a molecule of gold as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> to
be examined. My friend emerged from the condition
in which he could attempt to do this, declaring
that, although the molecules of gold could be
individually discerned, they were far too
complicated to be described. They each of them
consisted of an intricate combination of smaller
atoms clearly belonging to a finer <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> of
matter. This observation led me to suggest that
perhaps molecules of <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> of less atomic weight

than gold <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be more manageable, and we next
dealt with a molecule of hydrogen gas. This was
found to be composed of atoms like those of the
gold molecule, but relatively few in number. They
could be counted. They were eighteen in number,
grouped in a definite design and in rapid
movement. The rapidity of their movement did not
interfere with the counting, for reasons I need
not stop now to explain.
We then <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> on to examine a molecule of oxygen.
This was found to be more complicated, but still
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the reach of careful counting. The <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span>
of minor atoms was 290 - a figure the
significance of which was at once seen to be
remarkable. Divided by 18 it gives us 16.1, a
close approximation to the recognized atomic
weight of oxygen. Atomic weights, on the usual
scale, are calculated on the principle of
reckoning the weight of an atom of hydrogen as
unity. The relative atomic weights of other
bodies are derived from calculations dependent on
their varied combinations, again in a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> I need
not go into here, as that has to do with
commonplace chemistry. Was the ratio 18 to 290
operative in other cases? The atom of nitrogen
was examined and found to consist of 214 minor
atoms. That again gave the recognized atomic
weight when divided by 18. The result was
extremely suggestive, but did not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> constitute
proof that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">law</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> run all through the
series of the so-called chemical elements.
Meanwhile the minor atoms claimed attention. They
were apparently the really ultimate <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of
<span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> - atoms of ether, themselves
below the limits of sense-perception. Only when
in combined masses - if the expression can be
<span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> in reference to masses so minute as the
atoms of the chemical elements - do they come
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> those limits. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> incidentally the
research I am describing <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> out a new
discovery. The etheric atoms do enter into
combination in numbers less than 18, but then

they do not constitute any known <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> bodies.
They are molecular varieties of ether, the atomic
ether being the kind that fills all space, the
molecular ethers being definitely aggregated
around the planets.
So far the research was carried out in the year
1895, and happily the results, including all that
I have described above, were published at the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> and are available for reference. Six <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span>
later Mme. Curie discovered radium, and its
entrance on the scene revolutionized chemical
science in more ways than one. Study of the
cathode ray had already introduced us all to the
"electron" as an entity, but radium introduced us
to the idea that <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> consisted of
electrons, and that transmutation was a
possibility in nature, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> vindicating the
alchemical theory of the Middle Ages which
nineteenth-century science had ridiculed. Inquiry
of the ordinary kind was now directed to the
questions, what is an electron? and how many
enter into the lightest known atom - that of
hydrogen? The clairvoyant research above
described had answered both of these questions in
advance, but was not <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> worthy of notice by
scientists of the orthodox type. The electron
came to be treated as an atom of electricity by
some scientific leaders, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> to others that
<span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> was unacceptable. Electricity is a force,
not a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of matter. To <span class="t9 t11 t20 t21 t22 t23 t27 hoverable">speak</span> of an atom of
electricity is like speaking of an atom of
gravitation, and that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be transparently
ridiculous. Occult research had shown from the
beginning that the electron, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> itself an
atom of ether, carried a definite unit charge of
elecricity. Orthodox opinions as to the <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> of
electrons in an atom of hydrogen vary <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> very
wide limits. Some give us figures from 1 to 5;
some others guess by hundreds, and 700 is rather
a favourite estimate. The few of us who trusted
the clairvoyant research felt sure the real
<span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> was 18. Then in a few <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> came the proof

of this, a proof again so far ignored by science
at large, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> its ultimate recognition is
really a <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> of certainty.
The research of 1895 was only resumed several
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> later by my clairvoyant friend, assisted
then by another qualified observer. The task they
undertook was much more elaborate than the
former. Its purpose was to ascertain by actual
counting the <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> of etheric atoms entering
into composition of a large <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> of chemical
elements, also to depict the grouping of the
etheric atoms. The complexity of the grouping was
bewildering. Gold, for instance, consists of
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> combined groups, an exact description of
which, unless illuminated by diagrams, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be
hardly intelligible. The important idea to
realize is that the counting could only be
effected by degrees, the etheric atoms in each
group reckoned up separately with the assistance
of a secretary who wrote down the figures as they
were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> out, and only added them up after the
protracted observations were complete. The total
was 3,546. Then came the interesting question what figure <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> that yield divided by 18? The
answer is 197. The recognised atomic weight of
gold is 195.74. The deeply interesting principle
was vindicated and, as the protracted research
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> on, over fifty of the recognised chemical
elements were examined, and in all cases the same
principle was found to be operative. I have a
table before me as I write, showing the figures
reached in 57 observations of elements
commonplace and rare; and the result is nothing
less than a demonstration of the accuracy of the
original observation showing the atom of hydrogen
to consist of 18 etheric atoms. The notion that
the counting can in any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> have been made to fit
the theory is dissipated by the complication of
the work. Neither the observer nor the secretary
could have forseen how the figures given and
recorded by degrees <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> fit in with the theory
when added up. Eight of the observed elements

have over 3,000 atoms each; eight more have over
2,000. And an interesting hint supporting the
trustworthiness of the research is due to the
<span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that the observers found in the atmosphere
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> molecules that could not be identified with
any known element. Their electric atoms numbered
respectively 54 and 402, yielding the atomic
weights 3 and 22.33. Now in the course of Sir
J.J. Thomason's research (by ingenious electrical
methods) into the vagaries of the electron, he
found <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> to believe and to announce that
there must be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> unknown elements with atomic
weights of (about 3 and 22). He little realized
that the announcement vindicated a previous
announcement to the same effect giving similar
results attained by clairvoyant research.
But the 3 and 22 discovery was of insignificant
importance compared with the discovery of the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> of atomic weights. No <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> done in
laboratories in connection with the electron or
radioactivity is of such far-reaching
significance as the atomic-weight discovery due
to the clairvoyant research. It shows us ether to

the spectrum are beyond such vision, but we can
gain certain assurance that ultra-violet rays

combined enable us to trace the origin and

developed from lower forms. Indeed, if we go far
enough back we shall <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> life, which from some
points of <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> we may <span class="t3 t11 t18 t27 hoverable">call</span> already human,

story out of account, the information already
accumulated concerning the Atlantean races shows
conventional speculation relating to anthropology
and ethnology to be mere groping in the dark.
Clairvoyant observation gives us a clear-daylight
comprehension of the actual facts. Commonplace
thinking on these subjects is entangled with
phrases that are utterly misleading - the stone,
bronze, and iron ages; the neolithic and the
paleolithic periods. Flint implements, of course,
have their story to tell. They show that regions
of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> where they are found, at dates

early Atlantean periods before civilization had
developed, migrations of early sub-races of
Atlanteans spread all over the world. They slowly
outgrew early conditions <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> sharing the

Mr. Laing is impressive concerning the certainty
that <span class="t23 hoverable">high</span> civilization prevailed in <span class="t28 hoverable">Egypt</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span>

of Atlantean civilization previous to its
decline.
Perhaps, however, the most deeply interesting
aspect of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> Atlantean story has to do
with the moral changes that have gone on in the

decline becomes manifest. In their intellectual
perfection the Atlanteans in some ways were
farther on than ourselves. They controlled some
forces of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> we have not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> got commmand of,
and they were past-masters in the arts of
metallic transmutation, which, as a theoretical
possibility, our chemists have only just
discerned. But they had not even got a glimpse of
the moral beauty of unselfishness, care for the
welfare of others, love, in any of its loftier
aspects. Altruism, philanthropy, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have been
ideas for which their language furnished no
equivalent expression.

the large scale as a series of spiral cycles, in
the course of which we return to previous
conditions, but on a <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> level. Modern
civilization is now returning to a stage in
intellectual progress reached by the Atlanteans
at remote periods in the past, but with certain
very important embellishments. Aviation and
transmutation, now beginning to engage our
attention, were, as already said, Atlantean
achievements; but we must resume acquaintance
with them, plus moral progress, in which Atlantis
was sadly deficient.
The limitations of sense, besides obscuring the
past, veil the prospects of the future. Once they
are broken through, the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> plan of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span>

to those advanced leaders of our race described

seems, regarded by ordinary religious teaching,
as a finality. Clearer vision shows the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span>
future as infinitely progressive, and the sublime
conditions attained by Masters of <span class="t12 t20 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">Wisdom</span> merely a
stage of progress: a stage which the majority of
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> race ought to attain in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> run,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> the length of that run is all but beyond
the reach of imagination. As some have attained
it already, many more may do so in the future,
greatly in advance of its attainment by the
majority. The conditions of such relatively rapid
progress are the principal subjects of study for
pupils of the <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> occultism. Incidentally in
connection with that study <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> is let in on
many regions of scientific research besides those
to which allusion has already been made.
Emerging from the entirely primitive or childish
<span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Sun</span> and Moon and starry heavens as
designed merely to <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> up the earth,
commonplace modern speculation assigns
inhabitants to some, at all events, of the
planets. And the stars are known to Astronomy as
Suns, probably with families of planets in each
case. That <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> can be reached by simple
<span class="t14 t24 hoverable">intelligence</span> working with the results of
observation carried out on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the limits of
normal sense-perception. The methods of
observation available for the advanced leaders of
our race put them in touch with a new kind of
astronomy that may be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> "Vital," as
distinguished from the mechanical astronomy which
deals only with magnitude and motion. Mechanical

astronomy is as different from the Vital as a
mere geography book, just defining the boundaries
of the various countries, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> differ from
exhaustive accounts of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> inhabiting
each, their manners, customs, arts and sciences,
their political organizations and their
sociology. <span class="t1 hoverable">Physical</span> observation has shown that
Mars must be inhabited by intelligent and
competent beings, their huge artificial <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span>
proving this - in spite of tenacious incredulity
clinging in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of a few astronomers to the
idea that the Lowell's Canals are the offspring
of chance. Vital Astronomy enables us to
understand that the inhabitants of Mars are
linked in evolution with ourselves, the
inhabitants of this Earth, but at an earlier
stage of progress. The various planets of the
Solar System are not disconnected from one
another in their design and destinies, as they
seem disconnected in space. On <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> planes of
manifestation - regions of which the imprisoning
senses give us no hint - the immortal units of
humanity, the conscious Egos, migrate at
stupendous intervals of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> from some globes to
some others. The plan in detail is much more
elaborate than this rough sketch <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> suggest,
but it has the intellectual charm of showing the

planet Mercury is also blended as regards its
vital purpose with the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of the Earth,

has attained to far loftier conditions than we
here have reached as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> - is, in fact, a senior
evolution as compared with our own, and one in
which humanity is <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> entirely <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> from the
limitations of the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> senses. If anyone
mentally still imprisoned in these objects to
this statement on the ground that proximity to
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Sun</span> must make Venus and Mercury very hot, the
answer is that while <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Nature</span> has adapted <span class="t21 hoverable">flesh</span> and
blood to suit (with more or less success) the
climatic conditions of the Earth, it is quite
equal to the task of providing vehicles of

consciousness for climates above our boilingpoint, that can breathe comfortably in an
atmosphere at the temperature of super-heated
steam. Chemistry has still some discoveries to
make, and the composition of liquids that provide
Mercury, for instance, with lakes and rivers
defying evaporation at, say, 300º F. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be very
interesting if it could be ascertained. But less
so after all than the contemplation, possible for
our prison-breakers, of the delightful conditions
of harmony and <span class="t13 hoverable">peace</span> which are the keynotes of
<span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> on Mercury, and in greater degree still
on Venus.
The hints I have given so far of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> in which
senses - avenues of <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> - superior to
those we are most of us <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> to, enlarge our
comprehension of Nature, will naturally suggest
the inquiry how they affect our comprehension of
the conditions each of us encounters when we <span class="t6 t9 t13 t15 t17 t18 t23 t28 t29 hoverable">pass</span>
through the change <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> death. The answer is
simple. They make the change perfectly
intelligible; they render the region of <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span>
into which we shall <span class="t6 t9 t13 t15 t17 t18 t23 t28 t29 hoverable">pass</span> after undergoing the
change a pays de connaissance. That is the
foremost discovery with which they are concerned.
Current discussion as to <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> we really do
live again - a possibility rendered doubtful for
many <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> because religious teachers seem to
know so little about it - is sadly ludicrous in
<span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of the certain <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> on the subject
lying ready for us only just outside our prison
doors. People, indeed, still <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> them are
already inexcusable if they doubt the main
principle, for abundant information has been
smuggled through to them, and telephones - so to
<span class="t9 t11 t20 t21 t22 t23 t27 hoverable">speak</span> - have been <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> up <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the prison walls
which enable us to talk with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> outside. But
one must go outside fully to understand what lies
beyond. Dartmoor is big, but England is bigger,
and beyond England lie other countries of
stupendous magnitude. The <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> plane is an
extensive region, but regions <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the

cognizance of superior senses are more extensive
in more than a corresponding fashion. Our astral

prison of the senses is an envelope surrounding
the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> globe, but enormous in comparison.
To the appropriate senses it is as solid and
variegated as this. And there are numberless
variations of condition for dwellers in the vast
astral globe. The Earth-life has been <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> by
some in a manner productive as its consequence of
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> happiness and wide views of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Nature</span> - by
others unhappily in ways that entail consequences
of a very different order, with which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> who
lead commonly decent lives need not trouble their
imagination; unless, indeed, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> any selfregarding apprehension, they want to understand
the sublime harmonies of a <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> design which

same. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> the astral <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> provides purgatorial
conditions of highly varying intensity, through
which those who have badly misused the
opportunities of <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> must <span class="t6 t9 t13 t15 t17 t18 t23 t28 t29 hoverable">pass</span> before
attaining happier conditions, while, for a very
large <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> who have led fairly
creditable lives, the happy conditions are
reached at once. The study of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> in which
these vary in turn - meeting the needs of the
simply innocent immigrants as appropriately as
they provide for highly evolved entities - the
foremost representatives of earthly <span class="t12 t20 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">wisdom</span> and
achievement - is a profoundly interesting but a
very elaborate study, to subserve which, however,
abundant literature is now in existence.
This, moreover, will enable anyone who wishes to
push the inquiry farther to gather some
information as to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> in which the five
senses may be reinforced by the development of
new ones. In an imperfectly developed condition
there are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> organs in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> brain which,
when fully matured, will respond to the <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span>
vibrations of certain media in which we are

unconsciously immersed, and convey impressions to
the brain as vivid as those conveyed by the eye
when dealing with objects normally visible. These
organs are the Pineal Gland and the Pituitary
body. In some few cases they are already active;
in some others they might be cultivated into
activity; in the vast majority of cases they are
hopelessly incapable of such development during
the current <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of the Ego concerned. Their
development in the next <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> depends on
the extent to which, in the current life, the
<span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> in question devotes thought, study, and
effort to super-physical aspiration, for the laws
governing the growth of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> recognize <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span>
and effort as potent forces contributing to the
result.
Indeed, if we cling to the prison metaphor the
situation is abnormal in more ways than one, for
the authorities are by no means anxious to keep
their prisoners <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> their respective cells.
They must - in obedience to still <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span>
authority - refrain from actually helping
prisoners to escape, but they do not interfere
with those trying to do so. Prison-breaking, far
from being an offence, is their right - is
regarded as altogether meritorious. Once clear of
the walls the fugitive is never pursued or
<span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> back. Authority wishes him well, and
cheers him farther progress. He must, however,
break out by daring and force, not by cunning.
There is a door leading out of the prison into
the <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> beyond that is always unfastened.
Any prisoner can push it open and go out that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span>
if he chooses, but all are put <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> their honour
not to attempt an escape that way. And if they
break <span class="t4 t7 t12 t16 hoverable">faith</span> and do so, they are terribly
disappointed, for the door leads out of the
prison, it is true, but to regions in which the
conditions are still more distressing than those
of the prison itself, and there is no short cut
leading out of them in turn. To plod through the
forbidden country may <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> a longer <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> than

would have been spent in the prison waiting for
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> of release, due in any <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> sooner or

its rise on much <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> planes, but culminates on
the Physical. There, individualized

on, their progress depends on themselves. They
are launched on the upward arc of evolution and
all the limitations accumulated during the
downward arc fall away, or rather are shaken off
as the onward progress is accomplished. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span>
of shaking them off is difficult in the
beginning. Most <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> are imperfectly aware of
the disabilities under which they labour. The
senses have given them a rich and apparently
ever-growing store of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> and power. They

risen to the appreciation of its opulent
resources. None the less, the Beginning, for
every single Ego of the countless millions, must
be made from the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> point of departure. And
on the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> plane - the prison of my
favourite metaphor - the countless millions will
accumulate and remain until they make it. In that
<span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> lies the clue to the course that has been

<span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> were impossible at a former time. Bigotry
dominated the mental atmosphere. Ignorant <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span>

to accept the idea of a stick with only one end.
We can think of a stick with no ends at all, or
anyhow can talk of it as we talk of Eternity, but
to be on speaking terms with Infinitude we must
avoid the acquaintance of futurities that have no
past. Some phenomena - a bonfire, for instance may begin and cease to be, but <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> immortality
is an idea that claims in the forward direction
to share the attributes of Duration, and cannot
do <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> them in the other.
The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> "life" needs to be handled with care. If

or burned, their presence on the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> plane
is merely an episode in their lives. If these
continue they must, under other conditions, have
been going on before on other planes. Seventy or
eighty <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> of activity in the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span>

ceased to be a <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> of guesswork for the
millions concerned with the simple variety of
occult research described as Spiritualism, and
the current interest in that research is rapidly
rendering the current contempt for it in most
newspapers an illustration of their patient
efforts to represent the greatest stupidity of
the greatest number. A deeper research than that
content with merely proving that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> are still
alive after they are "dead" introduces us to the
logical conclusion that they were alive before
they were born, and thus, by stages, to the
inevitable conclusion that <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span>
functioning sometimes on the plane of Nature,
sometimes on another, is never "to one engine

bound," but always cycles round and round. In
hard scientific language this conclusion brings
us up against the doctrine of Reincarnation,
which, sharing the fate of many others, is made
to seem an offence to lofty aspiration by getting
itself profoundly misunderstood.
At first, introduced to the Western <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> in the
earliest theosophical writings, it captured a
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> array of supporters because, for the first
time, it enabled them to contemplate the
inequalites of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> condition <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> feeling
that they were incompatible with belief in <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span>
justice. Once could fall back on the theory that
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> ways were inscrutable, but it was
comforting to grasp a new idea that prevented
them from seeming, on the face of things, ways we
should personally be ashamed of. Objections were
forthcoming none the less. Spiritualists said our
friends on the other <span class="t6 hoverable">side</span> do not know anything
about the new idea. Others declared that they did
not like this world, and did not want to come
back to it, confident that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Nature</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> not be so
rude as to disregard their wishes. To others,
again, the notion of beginning <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> afresh at the
perambulator stage was intolerable; and
affectionate parents, mourning a loved daughter,
were horrified to think that on passing on
themselves they might be greeted with the news
that she had been reincarnated in Timbuctoo. From
another point of <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> the disbeliever declared
that he did not remember having had a previous
life, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> it was obvious that neither he
nor anyone else ever had done. Objections of
these varied kinds are very amusing to all who
understand more or less completely the conditions
of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> progress through the ages. The friends
of the Spiritualist on "the other side" are
enjoying the freshness of renewed life, the
reunion with others they may have cared for, the
vivid reality of that next <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> they have
reached; they are no more concerned with further
changes that may lie in the remote future than

boys at a school, <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span> of enthusiasm for cricket,
ponder on problems that perplex the invalid of
sixty or seventy. Nor if they did develop a
premature interest in the remote future could
they readily get information. If they have it in
them to advance to <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> levels of the Astral
world, beyond that they touch on first going
over, they will ultimately acquire knowledge; but
even that is not certain unless they have been
tinged during <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> with some aspiration
towards <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> knowledge.
A fundamental and deeply important <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> connected
with <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> progress is hinted at by
what has just been said. The <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> plane of
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> is pre-eminently associated with all
beginnings. Its importance in this respect cannot
be overrated. This condition underlies the
principle of Reincarnation, is the root of its
necessity. Spiritualism and other forms of belief
concerning the future <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> include a vague
expectation that infinite <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> progress is
possible after <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">death</span> down here. So it is, but the
permanent Ego is not spoon-fed with <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span>
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> unless he has engendered a <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> for
it in his working period on the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> plane.
If he has not done this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Nature</span> gives him such
blissful rest on <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> levels of <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span>
as he may be entitled to by the <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> he has made
of his <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> opportunities, and then another
<span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> of opportunities in the shape of renewed
<span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> life. Of course, there are other
purposes to be served by that renewed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> to be
discussed later on, but for the moment, in
reference to the first steps in our comprehension
of loftier destinies, Reincarnation may be
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> of as the system or method adopted by

At

"young" in this <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> seem to involve the fallacy
of assigining a beginning to that which has no

language used. The essence of the young Ego has
emerged from infinite <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> life, but at one
period has crystallized as a centre of

conformity with laws coming to be understood

and slowly this result is accomplished.

animal and vegetable forms, through solar systems

Perhaps a simpler answer than has been given
above might more easily meet the objection of
spiritualists who say that their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> friends
do not know anything of Reincarnation. Some of
them do! But the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that some of them deny it
is quite intelligible when we comprehend their
limitations, and unimportant. For most of us
belief in the rotundity of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Earth</span> is not
shaken by the denial of a few who still believe
it to be flat.
When disbelief in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">law</span> of Reincarnation arises
from dislike for the idea, one may first of all
suggest that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> who deeply dislike the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">law</span>
which brings trouble on those who pick other
people's pockets do not by such dislike divert
its course. But in truth, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> only dislike the
idea for want of understanding it. They do not
realize, for one thing, that the force which
gives rise to Reincarnation in each individual
<span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> is a <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> on the part of the Ego to
reincarnate. If no such <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> were generated, on

the plane of the Ego, after the personal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of
the entity in question has been fully enjoyed or
worked out in the Astral world, and then has
merged itself in the Ego on a <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> plane,
Reincarnation <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> place; but the
hypothesis for the occultist is unthinkable. The
<span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> for such experience is as inevitably

has been absorbed, as the <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> for fresh <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span>
is engendered during <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> in the body,

protest against having to come back to this vale
of tears with a very ludicrous aspect. Even after
eating too much and being for the moment
disinclined for more food, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> in general know

unconvincing. The advanced Ego knows that he must
come back to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Earth</span> in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> eventually to

reached when an Ego may have risen above the laws
affecting ordinary humanity, but <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> before then

Of all the misconceptions prompting disbelief in
Reincarnation, the most ridiculous is that which
makes some critics shrink with horror from the

elaborate <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> subject to its miserable

supremely important aspect of the next world, in
which we think of it as reuniting under happy
conditions the loving friends, wives and
daughters, <span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t13 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">sons</span> and fathers, torn asunder by

to limited vision. Reincarnation no more
interferes with the reunion on <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> planes of

In <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of what has just been said it is hardly

wearisome undertaking that can only be carried to
a successful conclusion in the workshop. In more

stupendous task, each stage of which has its own
beginning. We start in some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> or another on
the upward journey. We make some progress which
colours the super-physical period of rest and
fruition, and if we persevere we get on farther
next time. No one in one <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> does more

arrive eventually. If he were allowed only one

The
comparison is perfectly sound. If we were allowed
only one life, we could never get to the summit
of our possible destiny. Certainly there are
aspects of progress at variance apparently with
the rigidity of the statement above about the
necessity of providing for it by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> down here.
At given stages of progress we must be in touch
with super-physical planes, but the aspiration to
get in touch with them must have begun here in
the first instance. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> the importance of the

overrated, its frequent renewal is an absolute
necessity - deeply embedded, so to speak, in the
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> programme of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> evolution.
The methods by which reincarnations are
accomplished vary <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> very wide limits
according to the stage of development each Ego
may have reached. For a few (relatively), very
far on, special arrangements come into play.
Dealing first with the enormous majority,
including the savage and the civilized races, the
course of rebirth is guided - not by blind laws
inherent in matter, but by the will of <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">Beings</span> on
an immensely <span class="t23 hoverable">high</span> level of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> dignity,
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> of by occult students as the Lords of
Karma. So far as we know their collective
jurisdiction extends over the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> Universe. As
regards this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> we know of four such Beings,
each, of course, presiding over an immense
hierarchy of agents. One is concerned merely - or
especially - with the savage races; another with
the rank and file of civilization; another with
the cultured minority: these present Karmic
problems of deeper intricacy than are usual with
the less evolved majority. The fourth is
concerned with the Karma of Nations, but that is

a huge subject by itself which need not claim
attention for the moment.
The simplest savage has potentialities of
ultimate development towards infinity, but till
his Ego has become qualified for incarnation in
civilized races, almost any opportunity for
renewed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> in his own or some similar race will
suit him equally well. His <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> self
is merely a germ. The identity of his
personalities in each savage <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> could only be
traced by the keenest vision of exalted
clairvoyance. As a natural process the method of
bringing any Ego back to <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> will be
better understood if we consider the rank and
file of civilization. At that level each Ego has
made some progress in growing a <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">Higher</span> Self on
the plane of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> consciousness. The
personality in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> has developed capacities of
the mind, loves, friendships, and relationships
which give rise to a protracted and interesting
period of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> on the Astral plane after <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span>
death. This period may last for centuries, but it
is the outcome of finite causes and comes to an
end. The loves and friendships do not come to an
end. They are simply melting into <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span>
<span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> preparatory to their renewal in a
new physical-plane act of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> drama,
but when each Ego concerned has been assigned to
a new and appropriate incarnation by the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span>
discernment of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> of Karma, let us observe
what happens.
An atom of <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> - inconceivably minute, an atom
of each plane on which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> can
in function - clings to each personality after
death. This is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> understood by occult
students. Such atoms are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the "permanent
atoms." They <span class="t6 t9 t13 t15 t17 t18 t23 t28 t29 hoverable">pass</span> upward during the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> interincarnate period, and ultimately lodge in the
<span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">Higher</span> Self. When a new birth has been ordained
they are projected down through the intervening
planes, and the permanent <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> atom lodges in

the new mother. Does that seem a very feeble link
with the last <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> of the Ego concerned?
If we want to understand super-physical science,
we must get utterly rid of the habit of attaching
importance to magnitude. An atom may put a new
personality in touch with every event in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span>
it was identified with a <span class="t15 t23 hoverable">thousand</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span>
previously. But we need not here plunge into a
discussion of the mysteries connected with
Nature's memory.
If we now turn to the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of an Ego belonging to
the cultured minority of civilized races, the
<span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">Higher</span> Self, by the hypothesis, is more fully
grown. Something more than in the other <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span>
clings to the permanent atoms, with the result
that the astral permanent atom gathers round it
(or is provided by the agents of Karma with) a
temporary vehicle of astral consciousness, which
strengthens the connection of the new child's
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> with the Ego's last personality. Let no one
imagine that the new <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> becomes all at once a
vehicle of Ego-consciousness. For the first seven
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> of its life, the baby <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> does
not borrow from the presiding Astral any streak
even of its mature capacity for <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> and
emotion. Nor even in the first seven <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> does
it do more than accomplish (under guidance)
certain preliminary processes of growth. Only
when another septenary period has passed does the
child, at fourteen, begin to be as regards its
astral <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> the personality of the former <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span>
over again, and not until a <span class="t7 hoverable">third</span> septenary
period has passed is it infused with the
mentality of the former life. Then the Ego has
been reincarnated, except for what remains on
<span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> levels as the <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">Higher</span> Self. For
remember, we are now dealing with the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of an
entity so far advanced as necessarily to have
developed through many former lives a complicated
<span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> with Karma. There are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span>
forces awaiting operation. Capacities of various
kinds need expression. It may not be possible for

the directing Powers to <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> an incarnation in
which all these forces can operate
simultaneously. Successive lives, surrounded with
very different circumstances, may be required to
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> out the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> intricate problem. But the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Powers of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Nature</span> are very patient, and have
limitless <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> at their disposal. A large draft
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> these resources must be made when, in
addition to the intricate claims of an advanced
Ego's individual Karma, his <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t8 t13 t15 t17 t18 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> ties and hostile
relationships with other Egos have to be provided
for. But the manner in which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Nature</span> - the living
mechanism of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Will - exhibits a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of
combining everything with everything else, is for
a thoughtful observer the most dazzling of her
marvellous attributes.
The familiar phenomena of heredity illustrate
that last remark. When a child growing up
exhibits characteristics resembling those of
parents or ancestors, he is sometimes regarded as
supporting the idea that he is mentally and
morally, as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as physically, the product of
his parentage - a new soul. In reality the Powers
guiding his incarnation have put him into a
family the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> heredity of which will
provide him with a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> capable of giving
expression to his individual characteristics.
They have been able to combine that provision
with a life-destiny in which his Karma can be
properly worked out.
Let us now consider the peculiar conditions

advanced along that "Path" of abnormal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span>
progress, leading to initiation into levels of
the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Hierarchy which the occult student
refers to when speaking of "The Masters" of
<span class="t12 t20 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">Wisdom</span> and Power. At a certain stage of such
progress the Disciple, in fully conscious touch
on <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> planes with his own particular Master,
is allowed by the Lords of Karma, to pass, in a
certain sense, out of their <span class="t13 t23 hoverable">hands</span> and to be

guided by the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> himself into his next
incarnation. By the hypothesis in such a <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span>
there has not necessarily been any exhaustion of
the forces providing for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> terms of happy rest
on the Astral and Manasic planes. The Disciple is
willing to forgo such <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> enjoyments for
the sake of getting on, returning sooner than he
is obliged to the working condition of <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span>
existence. The <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> finds an appropriate
opportunity for his rebirth in a family the
circumstances of which will fit him all round,
provide him by its <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> heredity with a brain
qualified to express his intellectual or artistic
developments, and at the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> involve him in

progress. And the Disciple is definitely
consulted in regard to the choice. Probably <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span>

consideration, and the Disciple, we may be sure,
in such cases, is not guided in his choice by
what a mere worldly observer <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> regard as the
relatively attractive prospect offered by such
alternatives. Luxury, comfort even, in <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span>

the Disciple is standing, in consultation with
his Master, as simply of no account. The question
is - which proposed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> will be best calculated
to promote real <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> progress? Cases are
known in which humble and arduous incarnations
have been chosen in preference to others of ease
and far superior social station.
The method of reincarnation in such cases will
follow the ordinary routine in one way. The
permanent atoms will be guided to their
destination in the mother and the growing child,
but the former personality is entirely complete
all the time, on the Astral plane, looking on and
perhaps being able to some extent to influence
the parents in the treatment of the child, who
will most likely exhibit psychic characteristics
of an unusual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> - <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> for various reasons
this is not a <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> of certainty. Eventually, by

the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> the child has attained the age of
fourteen or a little more, and has grown a new
astral <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> identified in appearance with the new
<span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> body, the Astral of his former
personality will be discarded and the new <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span>
will fairly begin, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> it will not till later
on be infused with the intellectual attributes of
the Ego.
Infant prodigies are not necessarily, or even
probably, examples of the peculiar incarnations
just described. When wonderful musical faculties
are manifest at ridiculously early ages, that
condition can be traced to the impatience of the
musical Ego to express itself again on the
<span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> plane. Arithmetical prodigies may be due
to some unusual capacity in the new brain for
bringing over astral consciousness. But the study
of such exceptional phenomena lies outside the
effort to comprehend the normal working of the
laws regulating the sufficiently intricate
problems of ordinary reincarnation.
The importance of understanding these laws, as
far as that is possible, cannot be overrated.
They lie at the root of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> scheme of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span>

clearer mental conception of the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> condition
- and of the still <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> levels of initiation
beyond - than is provided for in current
theosophical literature. I feel sure, moreover,
that the Masters Themselves wish to be better
understood in the <span class="t1 hoverable">Society</span> they originated than
was generally possible at first. My present
purpose, therefore, is to deal with the subject
more freely than was hitherto been usual, and to
show how intimately the activities of the White
Lodge are blended with the affairs of the world;
how the Masters are much more numerous than was
at first supposed, and how They specialize in
dealing with the various departments of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span>

life, while working <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> in absolute harmony
of purpose; how Their <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> aspect - as we
regard Them from our point of <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> - is blended
with an intensely <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> aspect as They deal with
us individually, and how They, in turn, are
guided in Their action by the still loftier Will
above.
We cannot overrate Their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> if
we compare it with our own, nor can we overrate
Their limitation if we endeavour, in imagination,
to range the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> planes of <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> in
which supreme <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">law</span> prevails. Again, we
cannot easily do justice to Their affectionate
sympathy with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> disciples struggling upwards
towards loftier <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> life. In that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> Their

The <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> level of initiation is a fairly
definite stage on the path of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> progress,
but is in no <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> a halting place. The next

and that of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Father</span> is not less than that

personal attachments of Himself when in the
<span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> condition. From our point of <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> He is
the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> still, so in thinking of Those we may
know we need not be curious concerning Their
absolute rank in the Mighty Hierarchy.
A simple <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> not generally known throughout the
<span class="t1 hoverable">Society</span> is this: there is a <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> definitely

identified with, or, in charge of, every <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>

had some touch with an English, a Scotch, and an
Irish Master; also with an American Master,
indeed, with more than one specializing in the
Guardianship of the United States. I know also of
an Italian and a French Master, and in all such
cases the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> in question, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> He may have
held that rank for untold ages, and may have <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span>

race over which He undertakes to preside. He
generally resides at the capital of that State,
and this custom disposes of an absurd notion,
prevalent among Theosophists at one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> when the
<span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> condition was very imperfectly understood,
to the effect that no "adept" could endure the

In some cases and we happened to hear of them first - certain
Masters have found it convenient, so far as Their
bodies are concerned, to reside in remote
Himalayan districts. Their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> has lain
altogether on <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> planes, and all about the
world, under conditions involving the habitual
<span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> of subtler vehicles of consciousness, but
They can, and sometimes do, materialize in the
midst of crowded humanity. He <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be a poor
"Adept" who could not shield Himself from
inferior magnetic influences.
Obviously, by the laws governing the occult
world, national Masters cannot let Themselves be
known to ordinary <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> round Them for what They
really are. It is perfectly hopeless for anyone
not of their own <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> to try and identify Them.

them that of course there is a being of the Deva

nationality, but he is on a different line of
evolution altogether.

During happier periods of the past there was a
German Master, or more than one, but since Satan
has monopolized <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> influence in Germany,
the White Lodge Masters have had to withdraw from
that country. The resulting condition of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span>
could only be elucidated by a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> collateral
story into which I have no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> to diverge.
One Master, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> lies chiefly in America,
has been especially active in helping to guard
the transport ships carrying United States troops
to France, from torpedo attacks on the way. The
black and white forces on the <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> planes are
each, all the time, trying to bend <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span>
forces to their own ends, and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> in which,
throughout this war, the powers of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span>
White Lodge have been strained in resisting the
Satanic attack, is ill understood as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> by the
humanity that owes its escape from the fatal
disaster to that tireless protection. The <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span>
to whom I have just been referring has been
identified with the American continent ever since
it was part of the still greater continent of
Atlantis. He is linked, in a very curious way,
with the Atlantean period. And this leads me to
<span class="t9 t11 t20 t21 t22 t23 t27 hoverable">speak</span> on one condition associated with Mastership
that seems at first very bewildering. The
<span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> bodies of the Masters aften attain to
extraordinary ages, to be counted by centuries,
rather than by years. No incomprehensible miracle
is really involved.
During our youth we are all under the influence
of a force science has not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> catalogued, which
makes for growth and improvement. When we are
grown up it continues in operation for a time,
keeping the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> working order. Then, in
the natural course of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> at this stage of
evolution, that force ceases to affect us. Old
age sets in, etc., etc. The Masters understand
that force, among Their own intellectual
acquirements, and can turn it on or off at will.
As <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> as it is turned on Their bodies do not

show any sign of age. They may discard one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span>
and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> another sometimes for reasons connected
with Their work, but They are not under any
natural obligations to do so.
It is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> for ordinary humanity that they do not
know how to perpetuate <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> life. At this
stage of our development our bodies are not worth
perpetuation, while, if we make the best <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span>
of them for about the usual time, the Karmic <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">law</span>
will give us better ones for our next <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span>
lives.
Masters not definitely linked with particular
nations may range the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> at large, dealing
with its needs as they fall <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the scope of
Their speciality. Thus, one Master, who has been
so freely spoken of that it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be affectation
to avoid using His name - the Count St. Germain has been busy in Russia ever since the revolution
broke out, trying to mitigate its hideous
development - with poor success hitherto, I think
He <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be first to admit. It is a mistake to
suppose that He has only attained the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span>
level in this life. I believe He has been on that
level for ages gone by, but He has been taking
partial incarnation for the past few centuries.
These have been traced back through the latest Francis Bacon - to various personalities
distinguished during the Middle Ages. The mystery
is a little beyond common comprehension, but that
series of lives, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> certainly a continuous
series, never absorbed more than a part of the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">Spiritual</span> <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> in the background. I am
assured that there was about a <span class="t7 hoverable">third</span> of Him in
Francis Bacon - a very magnificent incarnation
all the same. Many Masters <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> in this way.
Indeed, on a level a little below that of a
Master, the arrangement is practicable. And a
Master, if He sees fit, can run, so to speak,
more than one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> at the same time. This makes
the identification of any particular <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> on
the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> plane a <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> of extreme

difficulty.
We ought to understand this possibility more
fully. Masters will sometimes, for special
reasons, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> incarnation on some very humble
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> level. I know of one deeply impressive
case. To fulfil some purpose of the White Lodge,
a certain <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> (not to be identified with any
hitherto referred to in Theosophical literature)
<span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> birth as a slave in Rome during the Domitian
period. It ultimately came to <span class="t6 t9 t13 t15 t17 t18 t23 t28 t29 hoverable">pass</span> that he was
driven into the arena of the Coliseum in company
with a crowd of Christians, to be devoured by
wild beasts. Being what He was, He could, of
course, have slipped out of His <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> as easily as
any of us might <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> off a coat, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> not
have been at all inconvenienced by leaving it a
prey for the lions. But He saw that by staying on
in it, and using His <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> as a <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> to pacify
the agonized apprehensions of the crowd around
Him, He could save them from the worst sufferings
of the ordeal. So He remained, and (here we touch
another mystery) by drawing into Himself the
vibrations of <span class="t28 hoverable">fear</span> from others, actually felt
himself the intense pain of these vibrations. He
allowed Himself to be consciously killed by a
lion.
This is not the only story of the kind I quote,
but it ought to be enough to show the utter
selflessness ("unselfish" is an inadequate word)
that is one of the sublime attributes of the
<span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> condition. For me, I have always regarded
the arena incident as constituting the most
wonderful lesson in occult ethics I have ever
received.
The <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> K. H., to whom I especially belong, is
pre-eminently concerned with the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span>
progress of humanity. That is why we <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> Him the
lofty influence peculiarly connected with the
Theosophical Society. In Atlantean ages He was
generally to be found exercising exalted priestly

functions, while his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> "brother" M.
(specialising in Power) was generally at such
times incarnated as a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span> or Emperor.
Another <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> - "H." will serve to identify Him
- is, amongst other specialities, in charge of
the movement known as Spiritualism. He has been
in charge of it since its inception, and before,
for it was deliberately planned by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Great</span>
White Lodge collectively to control the growing
materialism of the nineteenth century. It was,
as definitely as Theosophy, a White Lodge
Movement, of which Theosophy was planned to be
the natural sequel. In <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of this <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of
things, the mutual antagonsim on this plane of
Spiritualism and Theosophy is pitiably ludicrous.
Spiritualists, refusing to believe in the Masters
and Their teachings, are fighting against their
own illustrious Chief. Theosophists, scoffing at
Spiritualism, are insulting the <span class="t8 t12 t17 hoverable">wise</span> policy of
the White Lodge they profess to revere!
Again, it is foolish to overlook the splendid
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> spiritualists have done in
convincing millions that there is another plane
of existence, another <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> after this; and it is
marvellously foolish of spiritualists to spurn
the gift of fuller <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> concerning that
plane and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> offered them by Theosophy.
Spiritualism should have been the natural highway
leading to Theosophy, if the relation of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span>
had not been greviously mismanaged on this plane
in the beginning.
Certain members of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Great</span> White Lodge, on a

of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> in connection with science,
literature, and art. The scientific "Master" (a
<span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> designation <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be more suitable) is the
channel through Whom all new discovery and
invention (of dignified kind) naturally flows. He
inspires discovery at the appropriate times. In
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> programme <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> blocks of

dissemination on the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> plane at definite
periods. Discovery is never allowed to outrun
these <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> limitations. It may overtake them,
for the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> A. (let us <span class="t3 t11 t18 t27 hoverable">call</span> Him) does not <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span>

watches the drift of their researches, may,
indeed, prompt these, and then implants in some
receptive <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> a new idea along that line of
investigation. That does not in the least detract
from the merit of the incarnate discoverer. He
could never have picked up the inspiration unless
he had developed his Ego capacity to the required
degree of perfection.
I know less about the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> in which the artistic
Masters work, and will not attempt to describe
it.
What I have <span class="t0 t11 t24 hoverable">written</span> is but an imperfect sketch of
the conceptions I have been able to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of the
Masters and Their work, during the thirty-odd
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> I have been in touch with Them, never more
closely than now. But at the best on this plane
of <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> we can only get a feeble grasp
of some of the features of the White Lodge life.
In its <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> aspects the mere <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> brain
cannot deal with its conditions.
If the only purpose that the Masters had in view,
when beginning to give some of us "instruction"
in certain occult mysteries, had been our
instruction, in the literal <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> of the word,
their method <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> undeniably have been open to
criticism. They <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> us no lessons to learn; they
merely indicated a willingness to answer
questions if these did not seek information of a
kind They were forbidden to disclose. If we
imagine that system adopted in <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> plane
schools a boy desirous of learning arithmetic
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> fare as follows: "What do you want to
know?" the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> ask. The boy, utterly
ignorant of where to begin, might say, "I have

seen a queer mark in arithmetic books. Looks like
a V with a line at one end. What does it mean?"
The <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> say, "That is the sign of a
square root, and it means the figure which
multiplied by itself <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> give the figure you
see." The boy might put away that piece of
information for future use, but ignorant, so far,
of multiplication, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> not all at once be much
wiser.
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Without</span> being a gross caricature of the facts
that is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> we - for in the beginning I
worked with a friend who afterwards dropped out
of the Theosophical movement - obtained the
instruction that ultimately led to the production
of Esoteric Buddhism. On the face of things,
looking back, it really does seem absurd. We felt
that we were in close touch with almost infinite
<span class="t12 t20 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">wisdom</span> and knowledge, and we plunged into some of
the most enormous problems of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> evolution.
"How did humanity originate?" (We got a clue to
the <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> of other worlds beside this.) "What
other worlds?" (We got a clue to the planetary
chain.) We asked innumerable questions about it.
We wanted to know how to become a Master. Got
very litle satisfaction along that line of
inquiry. So on, and so on. Really, looking back,
I am surprised I did not make a worse hash of the
teaching than my earliest <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">book</span> is responsible
for. Why was all this thus?
Firstly, there seems to be a settled habit in the
occult <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> defining teaching as a response to
inquiry. Our method is so different, because for
the most part instruction has to be rammed into
unwilling pupils. There are no unwilling pupils
in the occult world, and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> is most
firmly implanted when it comes in response to a
definite <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> for knowledge.
Secondly, the purpose of the Masters in making
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Theosophical experiment was not to put
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> into possession of occult knowledge,

but to train those who proved qualified by
developing appropriate aspiration to become like
the Masters morally, as far as possible, so that
they might ascend the path of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> progress.
Some glimpses of the intellectual delights
attending such progress might be held out - had
to be held out, or the experiment was bound to
fail. The Masters had a very delicate task to
perform at first, in deciding how much <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span>
to give out along the line of this idea; how
resolutely to withhold <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> that might be
misused. My own beloved Chief, who amongst other
attributes is the embodied essence of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span>
kindliness, has told me how he <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> to sympathize
with my annoyance when He had to refuse to answer
some of my questions. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> came when the
motive for such refusals was much less operative.
That change accounts for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> in which, during
the last ten or fifteen years, I have been able
to expand the original teaching (or what passed
for it) enormously, with the very curious result
that a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> many theosophical students poring
over the earlier books, the Secret Doctrine
especially, cling to the impressions derived from
those earlier books, and resent the idea of
having them enlarged or, perhaps, in some cases,
corrected.
It really did not <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> at first <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span>
had correct or incorrect notions about planetary
chains, manvantaras, root races, and their
periods; of elemental nature, or the condition of

that they should get something like a clear idea
of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> in which the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Hierarchy represented for us by our Elder Brethen, whom we
now <span class="t3 t11 t18 t27 hoverable">call</span> the Masters - brooded always over the
world's welfare, and held out Their <span class="t13 t23 hoverable">hands</span> to all
worthy aspirants eager, or capable of growing
eager, to join that splendid fraternity.
Why did that first book, Esoteric Buddhism, start
the Theosophical movement in the Western <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span>

as, in effect, it did? Because it made <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span>
think of the Masters, and gave Them an
opportunity of thinking back, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> pouring an
extremely important influence into the world. A
deep occult <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> underlies that idea. No one
gets direct personal notice or guidance from the
Masters unless he looks up to Them consciously in
search of it, in the first instance. He cannot do
this unless he knows something about them to
guide his thoughts. The earliest <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">book</span> gave
multitudes a hint of Their existence; made the
readers think of the Masters, however vaguely.
This gave them Their opportunity. They shed back
influences <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> those who <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> of Them. Few of
us have, even now, more than a very imperfect
conception of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> as a power. The thoughts
that flew back and forward among readers of the
earlier books gave rise to the Theosophical
Society. A <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> elapsed before the <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">Higher</span>

imagine that it was founded in 1875. Look back to
the first volume of Isis Unveiled (p. 12 of the
Introduction), and reconsider that impression. It
was not until nearly ten <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> later that the
<span class="t1 hoverable">Society</span> began to excite real interest in the
Western world, and nearly another ten <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span>
elapsed before it was so firmly rooted that the
Masters could regard it as an accomplished fact.
In the interval between the early eighties and
the early nineties it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> through vicissitudes
that almost killed it outright, but it survived
them, and its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> became assured.
Then it was that restrictions, frightfully in my

could not even then give out to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> at

other worlds and their relations with our own,
the details of super-physical schemes in relation
to rebirth, after-death experiences, progress on
the Path, etc., etc., all these subjects were

thrown open to our inquiries, and the result has
been the enormous expansion of our <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span>

to put forth during the last dozen years.

during the latter end of the critical period
before the restrictions above referred to were
altogether swept away. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> from 1885 to

with instruction from the Masters. The early

appropriate channel. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> series of London

be milestones on the road leading to the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of
theosophical <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> at the end of the period
they covered. All they contained has <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> since
been absorbed into theosophical literature. Only
for those who may care to trace the history of
our teaching can they have an interest now. The
new series of London Lodge Transactions,
beginning in 1913, are on a different footing.
They have to do with later corrections and
additions to the earlier teaching obtained in
very recent years.

theosophical education will, perhaps, help to
make some embarrassments intelligible. Few

no means felt with the same intensity by all. The
Masters, in my opinion, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be the last <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span>

It is desirable that all should absorb as much as
they conveniently can of the magnificent Occult
Science that explains our <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Nature</span> and the
possibilities of our future growth. Broad, vague
impressions on these subjects are, however,
enough to give colour and meaning, so to speak,
to efforts we may all make toward living up to
the ethical teachings from the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> level, the

When Darwin first started the evolutionary
theory, some of us were inclined to regard him as
having made the mistake of concerning himself
with vehicles alone, ignoring the concurrent
evolution of intellectual and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> capacity.
Without, perhaps, fully realizing the magnitude
of his own achievement, he was embracing in his
<span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> both the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> and superphysical processes of evolution. Although by
profound study the process can be comprehended
even at the level of its obscure beginnings, the
principle is better grasped if we confine our
attention to the development of <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> in
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> being. By what <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">law</span> is the gradual

phrase, susceptible of further development in
detail, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">law</span> is that when <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span>

I must here quote a line or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> from Tennyson,

saturated with occult knowledge. He writes in one
fragment to be found in almost the last published
volume of his works:The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> let the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> of a brute to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> of a man;

And then I will let you a better."

In these compact lines we have the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> idea I
want to convey suggested, if not elaborately
expressed."Make it as clean as you can" means, of
course, make the best <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> of it, and establish a
Karmic claim on an improved <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> or vehicle. We
see the system working as we study the principles
of Reincarnation, working, of course, like most
processes in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Nature</span> in what seems at the first

makes the best <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> of his musical faculties in

vehicle better adapted to the expression of
musical thought. So with any other line of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span>

improving; the philanthropist, unconsciously to
himself, is imbuing his permanent atoms with an
ever-increasing eagerness to benefit his fellowcreatures. Down to the minor developments of
intellectual capacity, the study of mathematics
or philology, the same invariable principle may
be discerned. No one can in one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> clean all

metaphor; but by degrees all in turn will be
found to have claimed his attention, with the
ultimate result that the Ego acquires a vehicle
of <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> perfected beyond the needs of
commonplace life, and passes into the ranks of
Those we know something of, the Masters of
Wisdom.

As one burst of sunshine may illumine a landscape
previously obscured by shadow, this simple idea
seems to clear up <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> realms of vague
speculation concerning the processes we commnly
refer to by the vague term "evolution." And by
the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> so shed on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> subject, we begin
to put a scientific face <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> a vast range of
cloudy speculation embodied sometimes in the
phrase 'The Immanence of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> in Nature."
Imagination, of course, reaches out vaguely
towards the supreme problem: What is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span>
of the vehicle <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> which <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">Consciousness</span>
works? and in that direction, at present, at all
events, it is useless for us to aspire. But fully
appreciated, the present interpretation of
<span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> gives unity and <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> to the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> design of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span> from mineral
manifestation upward through organized <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> to
infinitudes beyond. It will be found to harmonize
with every <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> idea that Theosophical <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span>
has been endeavouring to deal with. A compact
phrase I have often been fond of quoting rests in
its significance on the principle I have been
endeavouring to define: "Whatever is, is, has
been, or will be, human." At the first glance the
value of the phrase seems to reside in the
promise it holds forth that all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> creatures
may aspire in thinking of the possibilities that
await them towards absolute infinitudes of
glorified existence; and it does that, but it
puts, so to speak, a scientific face <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the
maginficent prospect, and it fits in with every
idea we have been taught to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> with concerning
the dependence of progress on individual
exertion. No one is lifted to a loftier level of
being than that on which he finds himself at any
given moment, by any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Power</span> exterior to himself.
Helped by suggestion I Yes, we may all welcome
such help as that; we can none of us dispense
with it; but the suggestion must in all cases be
a hint pointing to individual exertion. Actual
progress in every <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> must be the product of

individual will and effort, the effort to make
the maximum <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> of life's opportunities; or, in
other words, of the vehicle in which
<span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> being is working.
Hardly any of the misty thoughts in which oldfashioned psychology indulged will remain clouded
by vagueness when the principle I am dealing with
gives them definite shape.
I will venture on a subtle illustration of this
idea. Thinkers who rather resent than aspire to
clearly defined <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> concerning the

fond of treating <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Christ</span> as a <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of
consciousness. "The awakening of the <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Christ</span>

the idea, is held preferable to any specific

thinkers are to the cloudiness of mysticism, the
recognition of such a specific Being seems to
them to degrade the idea, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> with the

has been in Theosophical possession almost since
the beginning, we know that there is a specific

from degrading the aspiration in each individual
Ego to comprehend spirituality, is just as
superior to the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> with which the

the better we realize that cloudiness of thought,

uncertainty as we gaze upward, vagueness of

remain incomprehensible. There is no inherent
value in cloudiness of thought. That which we
ought all to be aiming at in dealing with any of
the mysteries hitherto embraced by the vague term
"occultism" is clearness and precision of
understanding. The Truth, if we could comprehend
it, is as clear and precise as any of those
simpler truths of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> our grasp, and

as the simpler relationships of molecular physics
already have for ourselves.
2. - THE PLANETARY CHAIN
The first idea we had about the progress of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span>
on planetary chains was, looking back <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> it,
all we could be expected to understand at the
first blush. It was a huge expansion of the
elementary idea that this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> was the beginning
of all things, and that its gradual <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span>
could be traced in the familiar language of
scripture.
The very notion of planetary chains was an
entirely new one which had to be assimilated by
degrees, and has needed in later <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> very
elaborate explanation. The planetary chain that

we belong to consists, as the early teaching
showed, of seven globes, the first and last on
the Manasic level, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> others below these on the
Astral level, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> on the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> plane. We
jumped to the conclusion in the beginning that
all planetary chains were alike, consisting of
seven globes, and the idea has unhappily
permeated Theosophical literature to that extent
that it has misled many thinkers. It is really
only the middle chain of a manvantaric series
that consists of seven planets; in the previous
Manvantara a chain had only five; in the one
before it, only three; and in the one before
that, only one. I will not stop to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> out this
idea in all its scientific beauty. A mere hint
will be enough to show how the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> series of
Manvantaras is a harmonious conception beginning
with the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">Thought</span> - the first Manasic globe
- culminating in some supreme results that are
beyond our present comprehension in that far-away
future when the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> series will be complete.
But keeping our attention fixed for the moment on
our present planetary chain of seven globes, the
first idea we have to realize is that, when we
were told in the beginning about the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span>
wave sweeping on from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> to world, and for the
present occupying this earth, we were put in
possession of a broad idea which is perfectly
true, but which requires elaboration. The main
part of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> family to which we belong does
occupy this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> at the present time, but during
the various rounds of progress which have been
going on for an almost incalculable past, the
family has to a certain extent straggled over the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> series of worlds constituting the Chain. At
present we shall <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> it impossible to understand
the conditions of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> on the super-physical
planets, and we may leave them out of <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> for
the moment; but on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> physical, including
Mars behind us and Mercury in advance of us, the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> family is now distributed - part of it
already established on Mercury, part <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> behind
on Mars. The explanation is simple. While the

great majority swept forward to this earth, the
laggard remnant not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> qualified for incarnation
here remains on the planet Mars, a superior
vanguard already getting forward to the planet in
advance. The retarded condition of the Martian
remnant - counted, of course, by a fairly large
<span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> of millions - consists of those who have
(reverting to my former explanation about
consciosuness) failed to make the exertions
required for the acquisition of superior
vehicles. There is no vehicle of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span>
<span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> on this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> amongst even the
lowest savages that is not definitely superior in
some important ways to the vehicles of
<span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> now inhabiting Mars. Strange to
say, as often happens on the downward arc, some
capacities are still active amongst them, which
enable them to do <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> that we ourselves, in
spite of our superior development, are unable to
accomplish. The Martian <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> can handle <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span>
by arts that we, to a certain extent, have lost,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> the <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> of such arts does not represent
superior <span class="t14 t24 hoverable">intelligence</span> any more than a spider's
capacity to make a web that no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t2 t6 t8 t9 t10 t15 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">art</span> could
imitate, represents intellectual superiority on
the part of the spider. Morally, the condition of
the Martian <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> is below any level that we can
easily comprehend. Their forms are to our more
cultivated taste grotesquely ugly, and they
practically exemplify a saying applied with less
appropriateness to some savage races of our own
globe: "manners they have none, and their customs
are beastly." The animal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> on Mars is at a low
level, corresponding to that of the people. It is
purely reptilian in its character, and the
development of taste amongst the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> may be
imagined from the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that their <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> consists
of the blood of the reptiles swarming in the vast
inland lakes, with which the habitable portions
of the planet are covered.
Even amongst the Martians the evolutionary <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">law</span>
which presses gradually on the multitude is

slowly working. Some Egos - for already the
Martians must be <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> of as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> - gradually
establish claims on a better vehicle of
<span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> than those around them, and then
they become qualified for incarnation on this
earth, and are <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> over under the guidance of
appropriate emissaries from the White Lodge in
batches sometimes of fairly considerable number.
I have <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> of a recent <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> in which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the
last year or two, a batch of about a hundred
<span class="t15 t23 hoverable">thousand</span> Martian Egos were imported into this
world, finding incarnation, some of them, in the
aborigines, as they are called, of Australia,
some in the lowest types of Central Africa, the
best of them amongst the populations of Central
Asia.
The conditions on the other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> involving the
premature migration of Egos from this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> to
Mercury are curious and interesting when
understood, but at this step of the explanation
it will be more convenient to stop and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> a new
departure having to do with the relations of the
various planetary systems or chains of our Solar
System with one another.
Even in the first sketches of occult teaching, as
soon as the notion of the planetary chain had
been established in the mind, it became clear
that Egos evolving around any given planetary
chain, granting <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> will to each, must <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> out
different destinies. Some Egos <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> advance more
rapidly than others, so that at a fairly advanced
stage in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> process there <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be immense
intervals of conditions between those in the
vanguard and those in the rear. Then it was
explained that at a certain stage in the
development of any given planetary chain some
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have fallen so far back, as compared with
their more persevering companions, that <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span>
progress for the best <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have advanced to a
condition in which the worst <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> not be
qualified to make <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> of the forms then in

process of development. In other words, and in
the rougher language of our first explanations, a
period is inevitable in each planetary sheme when
those who cannot advance farther drop off from
the main current of evolution, only those who
have made better <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> of their opportunities
reaching onwards towards the final possibilities
of their existence. This period <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> to be spoken
of as the critical period of the fifth Round, and
for a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> no information reached us as to
what <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be the final destiny, in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of
our own planetary scheme, of those who <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> fall
off from evolution at that remote period far
ahead of us, the middle of the Round destined to
succeed that with which we are at present
concerned.
Later information filled up this gap in our
knowledge, and in so doing threw a flood of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span>
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the constitution of the Solar System as a
whole. Obviously the senior planetary scheme, of
which Venus is the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> world, has <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> since
passed that critical period, although for us it
lies so far still in the future. Already the
course of events must have decided the fate of
the failures of Venus at the critical period, and
the answer given me, when I was eventually
enabled to put the question, at once showed how
various planetary chains of the Solar System are
not to be regarded as entirely independent
undertakings. They are linked <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> in an
extremely intelligent fashion by the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that
the Egos who become the failures of one planetary

simple answer to the question, "Where are the
failures of the Venus scheme?" is embodied in the
one word, "Here!" Certainly, in my own
experience, no one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> ever before threw such

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> seven (or rather ten) planetary schemes,
all forming part of one coherent design; one saw
the <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> why they were not all at this moment

in similar stages of progress; one could look
forward to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> when, for example, the planet
Jupiter, now an incandescent mass of mineral
matter, will become an inhabited home of future
races, when those which inhabit our <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> will no
longer <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> among them any <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> of a less
exalted <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> rank than those we now think of
as the Masters, and when the future Jupiter
evolution will afford opportunities for a new
beginning to those who may have dropped out of
the evolutionary course designed in connection
with later developments of this world.
Now we come back to the further details of the
process. The Venus failures are here; more
precisely, what does that mean? In truth,
although failures from the present standpoint of
Venus attainment, they failed at a period in the
evolution of their own race already far in
advance of that reached by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> bulk of our
own people. None of them could be content with
such incarnations as are offered to humanity at
present, even by the most civilized races
inhabiting this world, or, at all events, no such
offers can be provided in anything resembling
adequate abundance. The problem as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> stated
almost hints at its own solution. I have already
said that the planet Mercury, belonging to our
chain, is actually the home of Egos constituting
the vanguard of our humanity. For the moment I am
leaving out of <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> those who, along the Path,
attain sublime <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> conditions which, for
that matter, make them <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> of all the planets of
our chain. But Mercury, inhabited by the very
best, so to speak, of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> family, became a
region in which Venus failures could freely
incarnate, and at the present moment "Mercury" is
the more precise <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> "here," which
impressed me so much when I first <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> it <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span>
in this connection.
And now let us realize more in detail the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span>
of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of which Mercury is the home. In many

ways it is so far superior to the conditions we
are familiar with here, that only by degrees can
we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> any conception of it. In some respects we
are helped to do this by a <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">book</span> which, at the
first glance, has nothing whatever to do with
scientific occultism - Bulwer Lytton's delightful
story, The Coming Race. We do not go far in
occult study before coming into touch with the
frequent occurrence of literary inspiration.
Masters taking an interest in that work, and
finding sensitive authorship, will constantly
inspire poetry and fiction, while others, indeed,
are inspiring scientific thought; but that need
not be dealt with at this moment. The <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> who
inspired Bulwer Lytton with the ideas so prettily
<span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> forth in The Coming Race did not, so to
speak, give Himself the trouble to invent an
imaginary <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> of dignity and beauty; He simply
drew on His personal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of the conditions
actually prevailing on the planet Mercury conditions absolutely familiar, not merely to the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Masters, but to many of those of somewhat
lesser rank, who are already able, on the Buddhic
plane, to roam the Solar System at discretion.
Perfect harmony prevails in the delightful
Mercurial community: the Satanic influence which
has filled this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> with strife and confusion,
<span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> we contemplate political, industrial, or
international relationships, has never penetrated
the peaceful regions of our beautiful sister
planet. Intellectual advancement has far
outstripped our own, and for many thinkers
amongst us speculating on the possibilities of
future sociology, it will be interesting to know
that in reality on Mercury, as in Bulwer Lytton's
story, the female half of humanity is distinctly,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> in no inconvenient degree, superior to and
predominant over the other half. It is difficult
to make the statement in any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> which
does not convey at the first glance a
misunderstanding, because the very <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> male and
female, as we <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> them here, have very different
meanings on Mercury, especially from the

physiological point of <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> from those we attach
to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> in this less beautiful world. And,
again, when we talk of superiority and
predominance, we can hardly keep touch with ideas
that seem from our experience incompatible with
those others - the ideas of perfect harmony and
love. Really all these apparently conflicting
principles are susceptible of combination in a
perfect chord like varying notes in music, and
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> subject tempts imagination. But for the
moment I must revert to the connection between
Mercury conditions and the claims on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of
the Venus failures.
In its later evolution, possibly in obedience to
a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">law</span> which may govern other worlds, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span>
of Venus became very much more advanced students
of beauty - among other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> - than we on this
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> can claim to be as yet. That drift of
development was already operative with the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span>
race before the critical period. So, as a <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span>
of fact, Venus failures now on Mercury are
enormously in advance of the earthly population,
as a whole, as regards the appreciation of beauty
on a level only represented amongst us, if at
all, by the greatest artists of our period.
Parenthetically I may here just mention a bit of
information that reached me a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> ago, and
seemed puzzling at the moment, concerning the
peculiar Karma which, in some cases, makes it
possible for Earthly Egos to be prematurely
transferred to incarnations on Mercury (I am not
talking about the inner round, which is a subject
apart). It is just possible for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span>
appropriately qualified by their Karma to be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span>
transferred. I must not stop to go into the
numerous details of the subject, but one
characteristic required by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> unconsciously
becoming qualified for the transfer, is the
artistic temperament. They must have some
qualification for appropriately enjoying the
heredity of Mercurial parents.

This <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> department of the subject is curiously
fascinating. Of course, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> "beauty" must
not be <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> in any narrow sense, but in one which
includes the natural beauty of trees and flowers,
the loveliness of colour in a landscape, the
harmony of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> in a structure, as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as that
beauty in the feminine aspect of humanity which
is perhaps the variety of beauty we all think of
first when we make <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> of the word.
As above suggested, not quite all the Venus
failures are already established on Mercury.
Some, if not actually amongst us yet, are
awaiting earthly incarnation, due, no doubt, to
their exact <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> on the scale of evolution, and
are meanwhile, from <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> levels either on the
Astral of Manasic worlds, influencing artistic
thought, inspiring artistic achievement actually
in progress amongst us at the present time, and
this has been going on over what we are in the
habit of thinking of as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> periods; short, of
course, as measured on the scale of natural
evolution. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> outburst of artistic
capacity in Greece during that period the other
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> which we <span class="t3 t11 t18 t27 hoverable">call</span> "ancient" was due to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> in
which Venus failures in our <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> worlds
discerned in that race <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> capacities for the
reception of their influence. Roughly speaking,
all Greek <span class="t2 t6 t8 t9 t10 t15 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">art</span> in sculpture may be regarded as
having been a gift to us from the Venus
immigrants, whom, from the Venus point of view,
we must still <span class="t9 t11 t20 t21 t22 t23 t27 hoverable">speak</span> of as failures.
There is something eminently suggestive in the
<span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that a more highly evolved, more morally and
intellectually perfect a race than our own, at
its present stage, should also be identified with
beauty for that matter, not merely in regard to
capacity to appreciate it, but in actual
manifestation. Looking back far to the rear of
our own <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> in evolution, we always <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> early
forms, more or less to our senses, ugly and
repulsive. The forms, indeed, of the degraded

remnants of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> family on Mars are simply
hideous, as compared with the best examples among
us. The animal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> there is uncouth and
repulsive as compared with the animal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of
this world. Doubtless there are exceptions that
will leap into <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> for everyone who
thinks on the subject, but very broadly the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">law</span>
of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> appears to link the moral improvement
of conscious <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> with corresponding
improvement in the beauty of form. When we
understand the intricacies of Karma better than
we do at present, it may be possible to <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> out
why <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> and women amongst us are sometimes
conspicious at the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> for beauty of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span>
and atrociously defective character. But
exceptions without, according to the stupid
proverb, "proving the rule," are at all events
compatible with its operation on a large scale.
And one more suggestion in connection with this
line of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> arises from definite information
about the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> on Mercury. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Without</span> going into
indecorous detail, it is enough to say that the
birth of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">children</span> is absolutely unattended with
distress or inconvenience for the mother. The

<span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> so unlike our own, so infinitely more

incidentally it must mean differences in the

at the first glance, seem to conflict with our
present conceptions of perfect female beauty. And

beautiful of the two. The perception of beauty is
a faculty that grows and changes in its growth,
and this <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> reaches in both directions, so
that when I have sometimes sought to ascertain

situation - as lamentable as it is ludicrous that has established an almost impassable chasm
between the vast <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> of super-physical inquirers
engaged with the methods of spiritualism, and
those who have appreciated what with all respect
to the other I cannot but describe as the
infinitely more important line of study identifed
with the Theosophical movement. One might
laboriously trace the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> mistakes were made in
the beginning, but as regards authentic teaching
from the Masters, on the strength of which the
Theosophical movement was launched, the subject
of astral <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> immediately following the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">death</span> of

we were drifted in the beginning into concerning
ourselves with the gigantic principles governing
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> evolution on a large scale, and disregarded
opportunities of understanding our immediate
future better than before, in a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> which
painfully reminds one of the old story about the
star-gazer who fell into the ditch. The pity of
it, looking back, is intense. The Theosophical
movement ought to have been recruited wholesale
from the ranks of the spiritualists. As <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span>
have turned out, it is only a few who can be
drawn across the gulf dividing most of them from
loftier work.
But now, forgetting all this, let us turn to the
accurate information which in later <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> some of
us have been able to obtain from lofty sources of
information concerning that astral <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> which

understood better than the first writers on

Theosophy, but which now we are able to examine
and interpret to an extent which puts the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> acquired by the ordinary methods of
spiritualism in the background altogether.
To survey the astral <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> in its entirety and to
comprehend its manifold varieties of condition,
the survey must be on an altogether <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> level
of <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> than that of the normal
inhabitants. This idea, which is obvious as soon
as stated, is ignored, altogether by
spiritualists of the simpler type, who imagine
that because their friend has passed to a new
<span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> he must know, not merely all
about it, but all that relates to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> destinies
beyond his own condition. And many spiritualists
will even accept negative testimony; a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> who
quite truly says that he cannot perceive any
reincarnations in progress is held by his friend
on this plane to have proved that no
reincarnations <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> place; but in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> indicating
the necessary imperfection of the spiritualistic
method as a means of acquiring knowledge, let me,
before passing on to deal with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> acquired
in other ways, bear testimony to the maginficent
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> that has been done in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> by
spiritualism in its relations with religious
thinking. The growth of materialistic belief in
the middle of the last century was so powerful
that, if entirely unchecked, it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> probably
have extinguished religious thinking forever.
Spiritualism, by proving that there was another

into touch, broke up the domination of the
materialistic school in a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> which no
theological influence could possibly have
accomplished.
Coming to detail, we <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> the <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> seven
playing an important part in the astral economy,
as in many other ways with which we are familiar.
It is a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> mistake to imagine that seven as a
key <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> is one of any deep significance in the

universe at large. It has a deep significance as
regards our world, of which, after all, the
astral plane is merely a part - a part as
definitely objective as so much granite rock to
appropriate senses of perception. To those the
granite rock <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> hardly make an appeal. We must
think of the astral <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> to begin with as
consisting of a vast series of concentric shells
entirely surrounding this Earth, the aggregate
diameter of which is enormously greater than that
of the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> globe. It is difficult to get
measurements in miles when dealing with the
region of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> in which, for some purposes,
distance is almost negligible, and yet, in truth,
there are definite magnitudes in connection with
the various subdivisions of the astral <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span>
which may actually be expressed in terms of our
measurement. Enough for the moment to realize
that the height above the earth's surface to
which the loftier subdivisions of the astral
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> extend is to be <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> of at least in tens
of thousands of miles. Then, if we begin to
attempt a survey of the varied subdivisions, we
have to recognize that the astral plane
interpenetrates the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> to
a fairly considerable extent, and that the
regions <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> submerged below the earth's surface
are horrible in their characteristics, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span>
definitely fulfilling a purpose in the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span>

There are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> distinct
concentric shells of astral <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> sunk <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span>
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> of the earth. The lowest of all is one
with which humanity has scarcely anything to do,
or ought not to have anything to do, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> in
the ghastly unprecedented conditions of Satanic
disturbance that we are going through, influences
from the lowest astral region have been <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span>
to the surface for our profound discomfort. Subplane No. 1 ought to be concerned merely with the
gradual disintegration of elemental forms that
played a part appropriately enough in the very
earliest history of this planet, but the need for
which has <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> since expired. Level No. 2,

immediately below the earth's surface, is the
real Hell of actual Nature, a condition of
suffering for those who drift thither that can
hardly be exaggerated in imagination. That such
suffering, however, is destined to be curative in
its character is a fundamental idea to which, in
investigating that region, we should always
cling. It deals only with the most hideously
degraded and atrociously criminal representatives
of our humanity.
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Without</span> for the moment attempting to go into
further detail in connection with this ghastly
department of the subject, we still have to
realize that when we consider Sub-plane No. 3,
that which is the fist above the surface of the
<span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> world, we are still in touch with a
purgatorial realm, the curative influences of
which are appropriate to evil-doers <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span>
iniquity falls short of that which leads to the
lower hell. Experiences on No. 3 may,
nevertheless, be a serious character. The
misapprehension <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> are so liable to fall into
in connection with this purgatorial condition
arises from a very common tendency to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> too
severe a <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of our own shortcomings. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">People</span>
taught to consider themselves miserable sinners,
merely because they are leading a commonplace
<span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> life, are probably, in most cases, so
entirely innocent in reality that when <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> of
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> they will slip unconsciously through the
purgatorial region and wake up happily on some
level of the fourth sub-plane. Again, the study
of the purgatorial region is so intricate that
imagination is misled if we dwell <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> it
elaborately before realizing the still greater
and altogether beautiful intricacies of the
<span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> sub-planes which, from the lower levels of
the fourth right up to the highest, are hardly
tinged with any emotion in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of
suffering. The intricacy and complication of the
vast fourth sub-plane will be readily
comprehended, when we think of it as the natural

future home of entities as varied as the
population of the earth, or, leaving out of
<span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> the humbler multitudes of uncivilized
communities, the difference between individual

like our own are so enormous and elaborate that

providing all with perfectly suitable environment
in the restful period between <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> lives.
Close observation, to begin with, divides the
fourth sub-plane into another septenary series,
but seven is <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> far in the rear as a <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span>

that the affections which play so important a
part in our <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> even here are still more supreme
in their importance on all the happy levels of
the astral world. Karma entangles incarnate <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span>
with all kinds of associations, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> it may
permit us to enjoy some really congenial
companionship it often forces <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> us a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> deal
of the other kind. In the astral life, even on
the fourth level, not to <span class="t9 t11 t20 t21 t22 t23 t27 hoverable">speak</span> for the moment of
loftier conditions, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> are never thrown into
companionship which is otherwise than congenial.

This is one of the foremost assurances we gather
from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> speaking to us from the next world.
Sometimes they are still with friends they have
known and cared for on the Earth-life, but in any
<span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> towards whom they feel entirely
sympathetic.
In attempting this sort of survey, the magnitude
of the task is intimidating. We have accumulated
such a vast <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> of detailed information
concerning astral life, that, to <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> a favourite
similie, one cannot see the forest for the trees;
but keeping for the moment the generalities, let
me attempt to indicate the leading
characteristics of the vast fifth, sixth, and
seventh sub-planes of the astral world. These
must not be <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> of as definitely superior to
the other. Throught the various minor subdivisions of the vast fourth sub-plane <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> do
actually get promoted, as it were, from one to
the other as their qualifications for enjoying
the <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> regions become developed; but once
attaining the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> levels of the fourth, the
other regions are reached, not so much by virtue
of anything that can be <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> of as promotion,
but in accordance with what may much more
accurately be described as individual taste.
Roughly speaking, the fifth sub-plane is the
region in which intellectual activity can most
easily expand; the sixth is more devotional in
its character, while the seventh is a region in
which those Egos that have played an important
public part in the Earth-life <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> themselves in
congenial companionship, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> reach of
opportunities for developing their own
qualifications as leaders of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> in preparation
for future incarnations along that line of
activity.
The idea just hinted at interprets the enormously
significant <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that in various departments of
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> distinction <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Egos remain by preference
on the <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> levels of the astral <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> instead

of passing on, as they conceivably might, to the
still more elevated conditions of the Manasic
plane. Let us consider, for example, the choice
to be made by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> of science as they
<span class="t6 t9 t13 t15 t17 t18 t23 t28 t29 hoverable">pass</span> on from <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> life. Assume, first, that
they have no bad Karma to keep them for a while
on No. 3. They wake up on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> levels of
the fourth in company with congenial friends in
their own line of development. They quickly learn
that on the fifth, to which they can <span class="t6 t9 t13 t15 t17 t18 t23 t28 t29 hoverable">pass</span> on at
will, splendid opportunities for carrying on the
scientific researches to which they may have been
devoted lie <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> their reach. They see that to
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> a forward leap to the Manasic plane <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span>
break the continuity of their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> - <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">land</span> them on
levels of perception out of tune with the science
they have been <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> to. It <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> carry them on to
another line of development altogether. By
keeping on the astral they acquire new <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span>
in tune with that of their lives just spent. That
will invest their Egos with expanded capacity. In
the next <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Earth</span> they will be able to carry
on their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> from the point at which they <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span>
it off last, and they see the plain path of duty
before them.
The same principle certainly applies to the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span>
of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> poets of the past who are gathered
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> on the sixth sub-plane, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> in other
departments of artistic greatness complications
may arise. But how about <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> who are not
especially distinguished? Have they any choice as
regards astral and Manasic destinies? Serious
confusion of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> arose among theosophical
students in the beginning by <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> in
which we happened to pick up some quite correct
information about the Devachanic state. That is a
condition of blissful illusion on the lower
levels of the Manasic plane, appropriate to the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> innocent of wrong-doing, of affectionate
nature, but not highly qualified intellectually,
or in other ways, for active <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> or progress on
the astral plane. The mistake we made at first

was to suppose that the Devachanic <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> was a
goal to be aimed at by all. As we have come to
understand the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> and opportunities of the
<span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> astral world, the mistake assumes a
ludicrous aspect.
Obviously the study of astral details is an
endless task, and can only be carried out
thoroughly when we are in personal touch with
them; but one idea not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> dealt with in this
hurried survey can be understood now, and claims
attention. Besides that which may be broadly
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> of as the stratification concentrically
of the astral world, it has vast divisions that
may be <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> of as corresponding to the
geographical divisions of this Earth. Over the

astral regions appropriate to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> of the
region below. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> the astral regions over India
and other parts of Asia are quite different in
many ways from the astral regions over European
countries. This does not interfere with the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span>
that movement from one part of the astral <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span>
to any other with the velocity of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> is open
to any one belonging to that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> who knows, to
start with, that he has the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of getting
about in that way. In truth, that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> only
appertains to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> who have ben making some
progress during <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> in occult study.
The vast majority of perfectly commonplace <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span>
on the comfortable lower levels of the fourth
sub-plane never want to investigate, for example,
the corresponding conditions of the Indian astral
world. In a still more emphatic extent the Indian
on the astral never thinks of its Western aspect,
unless he belongs to the few who have travelled
West in life.
Does the geographical idea adapted to astral
conditions embarrass <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> in any way? Are
there blank spaces corresponding to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>
oceans? Not at all. The ocean spaces allow of
conveninent adjustments. Our British astral

stretches half across the Atlantic, and no doubt
impinges (though I do not remember to have <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span>
of this as a fact) on the American astral,
necessarily a very wide domain.
For those who realize the importance, as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as
the possibilities of getting definite and vivid
mental conceptions of super-physical Nature, this

significant. It all helps to make the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span>

in some <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> attribute of exalted
consciousness, but all progress is gradual. That
is the foremost principle to be discerned in
studying astral life. Spiritualists all recognize
it, as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as those who derive super-physical

accord - in that symmetrical aspect which appeals
so powerfully to the intelligent observer. That
is the peculiar charm of the later Theosophical
teaching. It enables all who truly understand the
Theosophical movement to feel that they are
engaged not merely in stimulating <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span>
aspiration, but in the magnificent task of

4. - THE INFINITE FUTURE
As I have endeavoured to show, in dealing with
the phenomena of the astral plane, it is possible
to obtain clearly defined <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> in reference
to some aspects of the super-physical future
awaiting mankind. The immediately "next world"
may become so vividly forseen during our stay in

this one, that its importance to us may be
appreciated in a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> rarely attained under the
influence of simple religious thought. That alone
may give rise to a beautifully reverential
emotion in reference to the future life, but not
to the same kind of absolute confidence
engendered by specific knowledge. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Take</span> an
imaginary <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> - in illustration of what I mean from the possible conditions of ordinary life.
Suppose a young <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> entering some business or
profession is told by some friend, "You might do
better if you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> to America." The young <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span>
does not deny this, but still thinks he can do
fairly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> at home, so he does not dwell in
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> on the friend's idea. Suppose he is
offered a definite engagement or opportunity in
America, and signs a contract to go there next
year. Will he not become at once deeply
interested in the conditions of residence in
America? He <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> read books about the country,
talk eagerly with travellers who had been there;
fit himself out with clothes and other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span>
appropriate to the climate he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> know to be
that of his future home. He <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> not neglect his
current work, because he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> know that his
efficiency therein <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have much to do with his
welfare in the new life; but he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> look on the
current <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> with an eye to the future, attending
to it all the more zealously so far as it trained
his capacity, but with a <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> of detachment that
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> make him relatively indifferent to its
immediate results.
Will the little parable fit the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of those who
are - and who are not? - destined to migrate at
no very distant future to the astral plane? Most
people, it is true, have made no attempt to get
information in advance in reference to the
conditions prevailing there, because they have
not believed any information on the subject to be
trustworthy. The misty suggestions of religious
doctrine <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> all details obscure. Spiritualism
incurred discredit in various ways, and the

importance of its main revelation was imperfectly
understood by the critical <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> at large; but
now we have to deal with a fuller revelation
conveyed to us by Theosophy. The history of the
movement since 1880 embodies its credentials. The
vision of the future is clearing up in many
directions. That department which includes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span>
on the astral plane is illuminated by a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>
wealth of knowledge. For all who appreciate this,
that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> sheds <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> on the path they are
actually treading through the current <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span>
life, and with an expanded <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of gazing into
futurity, we are already beginning to concern
ourselves with problems of infinite futurity
extending far beyond the range of astral
experience and <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> reincarnation.
The feeling with which we do this is very unlike
that which governs the investigation of astral
conditions. The ultimate conditions of our
humanity when the history of this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> is
complete are interesting only to thinkers who can
deal in imagination with states of consciousness,
so far transcending that of any personal life,
that they are content to lose touch with the
limitations which actually engender the feeling
of individuality. And if, as we may, we look
beyond the limitations of the one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> we seem
to lose sight of ourselves. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> the
contemplation of infinite futurity is not at the
first glance at all events compatible with an
interest in ourselves. But none the less does it
dignify all thinking, even of the kind which does
relate to ourselves. We know that the continuity
of our individual <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> will never be
broken. Plant us suddenly in the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> we shall
be in - say, ten million <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> hence - and that
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be so unlike our present <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> that we
should not recognize ourselves. The leap <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be
equivalent to annihiliation of our present
selves. The gradual character of the change will
preclude this unhappy result. So we really may
discuss the problems of infinitude with composure

without making the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> mistake of projecting
our personal limitations into infinity.
Campbell's poem - beautiful in some respects "The Last Man" is a ludicrous illustration of
this mistake. "I saw the last of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> mould,
That shall Creation's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">death</span> <span class="t0 t6 t7 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t17 t20 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">behold</span> as Adam saw
her prime." No doubt "The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Sun</span> himself must die,"
but that will not happen till the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Life</span> of the
Sun, including ours, is transferred to another
vehicle, and we know enough to forsee the change.
We know that our <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Sun</span> is one of many constituting
a stupendous Cosmos, of which the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> star
Sirius is the centre. We can apply the rule, "as
below; so above," even to this <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of things.
The planets of our solar system breed their
humanities, which attain perfection, and <span class="t6 t9 t13 t15 t17 t18 t23 t28 t29 hoverable">pass</span>
into <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Hierarchies. The aggregate
hierarchies of each solar system in the Sirian
Cosmos must have corresponding destinies on a
loftier level. With us, planet is linked with
planet in accordance with a comprehensive scheme
providing for the ultimate perfection of all.
Beyond doubt the solar systems of the Cosmos must
be linked <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> in a somewhat similar way. And
already we have learned something about their
destinies, which shows these analagous to the
idea underlying the succession of manvantaras in
each planetary chain of our system. A <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> which
is in manifestation on the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> plane has in
a former manvantara been a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> on a superphysical plane, and will again, in some
mysterious upward arc of evolution, be on a
super-physical plane. I avoid saying on the
Astral or Manasic plane because these terms in
reference to the Cosmos must mean something very
unlike their <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> in this one solar system.
All through these mighty changes the continuity
of each individual <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> concerned with
them will be maintained. However overwhelming to
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> may be the character of these colossal
processes of change, we can already contemplate

them with open-eyed admiration, as on a lesser
scale we may contemplate the splendour of a
mountain range bathed in the colours of the
sunset. Even natural beauty and grandeur of that
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> is uplifting in its effect on the emotions.
So with the mental influence of attempts to gaze
in <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> at the infinitudes of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span>
development. By comparison our Humanity seems so
small - if, indeed, we can think of it all as the
stupendous magnificence of the Cosmos is partly
revealed to us. In one sense, if we can forget
it, so much the better. <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Truth</span> lies in some
paradoxical phrases about sublime results
attained by the loss of what seems everything for
the moment, but paradoxes may be misleading as
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as suggestive. If only by our capacity to
admire, we are identified with the glories of the
infinitude - the realm to which, attached to it
by ties that can never be broken, we eternally
belong.

research in such matters very soon reaches the
limit of its tether. In dealing with the remote
past it is paralyzed for want of <span class="t0 t11 t24 hoverable">written</span> records,
and at the best can only supplement these by
interpreting a few inscriptions on stone. With
their aid we are enabled to reach back in the
direction of what Mr. Samuel Laing calls "Human
Origins" some 5,000 <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> before the Christian
era. But evidences which are not less certain
than those of Egyptian hieroglyphics, show us
that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Man</span> existed on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> at past periods

problem which, in its broadest aspects, only
admits of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> alternative hypotheses. Either for

early civilizations at remote periods, the
regular historical traces of which have been
lost.
Comparing these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> views, mere reasoning on the
basis of evidence that everyone is equally
qualified to appreciate will go far to support a
belief in prehistoric civilizations. In Egypt,
the testimony of the monuments and of papyrus
records, already translated, carries us back to a
period about 5,000 <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> B.C.

<span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> ourselves just as much in presence of
Egyptian civilization as at that relatively
modern epoch of Egyptian grandeur, the Eighteenth

Dynasty. According to the admirable German
Egyptologist, Brugsch Bey, Menes, the first <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span>
of the dynasty mentioned by Manetho, altered the
course of the Nile by constructing an enormous
dyke, in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> to facilitate the foundation of
Memphis. He was a law-giver, moreover, and is
said to have greatly augmented the pomp and
extravagance of the monarchy, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> showing

ruler, but one who had already contracted some of
the vices of civilization, a sure indication that
he belonged to a declining rather than to a
rising era of his country's progress. But, in
truth, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> have got into the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> of thinking
of him as if he were a primeval personage, merely
because he begins Manetho's list of the kings in
so far as that list has ben preserved for us by
the accident of its quotation by some classical
writers. The original <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> of Manetho vanished
probably in the smoke of the Alexandrian library.
It is known through other writers that Manetho
spoke of Egyptian epochs <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> previous to that of
the thirty dynasties; and even if he had not done
so, the situation faintly portrayed as prevailing
in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of the Menes is enough to show that
it must have been the growth of a social progress
extending into the past for almost immeasurable
ages previously. Fifteen and not five milleniums
B.C. must be <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> into <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> - according to
some of the modern Egyptologists now engaged in
translating the papyri - if we wish to frame a
picture in our own minds of the rise of Egyptian
civilization.
Turning now to another modern investigation, we
have to recognize that by degrees a mass of
testimony has accumulated on our <span class="t13 t23 hoverable">hands</span> in support
of the classical legend concerning the lost
continent of Atlantis. The Egyptian priests whom
he visited gave a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> deal of information on
that subject to Plato's ancestor Solon. For a
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> modern scholarship was inclined to
treat the story as a fable, one hardly knows why,

because the recognized course of change on the
earth's crust makes it certain that most of what
is now dry <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">land</span> was once ocean bed, and vice
versa. There is an a priori probablity,
therefore, that some such continent as the
"fabled" Atlantis must once have existed. And now
there are abundant evidences, derived from the
surveys of the Atlantic bed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the last few
years, to show that the site assigned to Atlantis
was probably that of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">land</span> masses during
some former configuration of the earth's surface.
Furthermore, comparative archæology brings out
identities between the pre-historic symbolism and
remains of Mexico and Central America on the one
hand, and those of <span class="t28 hoverable">Egypt</span> and Syria on the other.
These point to a common origin which Atlantis
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> exactly supply. A persevering explorer of
Mexico and Yucatan, Dr. Le Plongeon, has, to
quote a recent and very striking scrap of
evidence, succeeded in deciphering the character
in which ancient Mexican inscriptions are
written, and has even translated a very old
manuscript saved from the vandalism of Cortez and
his attendant monks. This turns out to include a
straightforward record of the final catastrophe
which swallowed up the last remnant of Atlantis
ten or twelve <span class="t15 t23 hoverable">thousand</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> ago.
The question of Atlantis is immensely important,
and I am, for the present, merely referring to
the chain of reasoning by which its actual
<span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> in former <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">days</span> is supported. A thorough
examination of the merely exoteric evidence on
the subject <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be a large undertaking in
itself, and I have another task before me for the
moment. But all theosophical students, and even
cursory readers of theosophical books, will be
aware that the teaching concerning the origins of
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> race that have been given to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span>
in connection with the inauguration of the
theosophical movement, gear in with that belief
in the former <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> of the Atlantean
continent which, as I have shown, is making its

way even in the outside world, which has nothing
to do with theosophy. Humanity, according to all
theosophical authorities, is evolved through a
series of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> root races, of which the
Atlantean race was the predecessor of our own. I
do not put forward the statement as in itself
conclusive, because the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> character of
theosophic teaching - as far as its really
qualified exponents are concerned - is opposed to
the principle of ex cathedra assertion. The
regular method of instruction adopted by the
Masters of occult science is to show the student
how his own interior dormant faculties may be
awakened and <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> to bear on the discovery of
truth, <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> it has to do with the planes of
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Nature</span> and <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> superior to our own, or
with periods of the world's history <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> anterior
to our own. Until the pupil is sufficiently
advanced to have the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of applying his own
direct perceptions to the questions he may wish
to investigate, he is almost discouraged from
taking the statements of others, more advanced
than himself, on trust. But, at the same time, we
must steer a middle course between the attitude
of mental servility and the attitude of narrowminded incredulity. For the reasonable theosophic
student which has found substantial ground for
relying on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> and bona fides of the
occult Masters, from who our current theosophic
teaching has been received, the statements they
make in reference to such matters as the
character and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Nature</span> of the Atlantean
race will necessarily have very <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> weight.
Indeed, I may go a step forward in explaining why
some theosophic students at all events come to
look <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> facts concerning Atlantis, and the

remote history of Egypt, as coming <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the

An instrument of research is placed in the <span class="t13 t23 hoverable">hands</span>

of theosophic students sufficiently advanced to
make <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> of it, which actually brings a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>

the reach of their direct perception. This is the
faculty of actually seeing, with an inner <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span>
adapted to the process, former states and
conditions of any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> or <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> with which the
seer or clairvoyant may be in contact. Many

the most interesting developments of science in
progress around us, as to disbelieve in
clairvoyance from A to Z. To those of us who know
better, that is like disbelieving in the
differential calculus - an attitude of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span>
simply absurd in presence of recorded facts and
experience. Clairvoyants may be one per mil, one
in ten <span class="t15 t23 hoverable">thousand</span> if you like, of the population at
large, but they are sufficiently numerous to make
the reality of their capacities as certain as the
occasional capacity of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> to

Clairvoyance has many varieties and
ramifications, but that with which I am concerned
for the moment has been <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> - rather clumsily,
perhaps, by modern writers dealing with it psychometry. In its simplest manifestation it is
not very uncommon. I have met many people,
besides those who have had a regular occult
training, who are able, by fingering a letter,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> looking at it or reading it - or perhaps
by putting it to their foreheads - to get
impressions concerning the <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> who has <span class="t0 t11 t24 hoverable">written</span>
it, extending sometimes to an accurate
delienation of his outward appearance and
character. Now, this accomplishment depends <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span>

their wider manifestations. Psychometrising

that has ever <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> are
indestructively preserved for ever. This medium
is spoken of in the occult literature of the East
as the Akasa. European medieval occultists mean
the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> when they <span class="t9 t11 t20 t21 t22 t23 t27 hoverable">speak</span> of the astral
light. This astral <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> includes a record for

Psychic faculties of a very adept-like order,
educated, moreover, with scientific precision,
and borne up on a highly spiritualized character,
are required for the complete exploration of the
astral light. Such faculties belong to the <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span>
theosophic teachers, and it is partly to their
exercise that is due the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> concerning the

say "partly" because, in truth, the <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span>
initiates of occultism possess <span class="t0 t11 t24 hoverable">written</span> records
that have been handed down to them by a line of
predecessors, but their own faculties enable them
to verify these at any time. And, in truth, there
are stages of development which many of their
pupils reach from which a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> deal of
historical - not to <span class="t9 t11 t20 t21 t22 t23 t27 hoverable">speak</span> for the moment of other
sorts of - information can be gathered from the
astral light. This has sometimes been <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the

most familiar kind - is in <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> a reading in the
astral light. But the faculties that have not
been developed by occult training are only
capable of reading those records, at the making
of which the <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> concerned has actually been
present. Only with those have his astral senses
been closely enough associated to make it
possible for him to recover touch with them at
will. The occultist <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> astral senses are very
much more delicate is able to follow other
channels of association, other magnetic currents,
to <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> the technical expression, and this hint

gives us the clue to the comprehension of the
psychometric faculty.
Tangible objects, as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as the inner vehicles

permanent magnetic currents with the astral
records that have been originally established in
their neighbourhood. The trained occultist, by
touching or handling such tangible objects, is
enabled to get <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> these currents, to put his
own astral senses into the same relationship with
the astral records to which such currents lead,
as that which normally exists between his own
astral self and bygone scenes of his own <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span>

Desirous of remembering it, he turns back his

scene of which he thinks. The occultist in the

were associated.
This is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> in which, for the occultist, the

is a question that can only be considered in
reference to each <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> in turn; but, at all

assisted - in such attempts as I have made to
penetrate rather more deeply than usual the
mystery of Egyptian antiquities - by psychometric

up a conception of the early beginnings of
Egyptian civilization which constitutes a
coherent and intelligible sketch of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span>

towards which archæological research of the
ordinary kind has been groping its way. I will
now put forward the story for the benefit of all
who may be sufficiently in touch with occult
methods of investigation to appreciate its prima
facie claim to attention.
Of course, the investigation of Egyptian
beginnings brings us into relations with the
Atlantean race. If we go back far enough in the
history of mankind - if we go back a million

period when there was next to nothing else in the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of a population on the earth, except the
Atlantean race - inhabiting many regions, as the

formed part of the continent of Atlantis - just
as at the present day, to draw an illustration
from one of the minor ethnological divisions of
our own <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> race, the Caucasians inhabit many
other regions of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> besides the Caucasus.
But different ramifications of the same root race
may differ very widely from each other: and at a

the continent of Atlantis had attained a very
<span class="t23 hoverable">high</span> degree of civilization and power, Egypt,
amongst other countries, was in the occupation of
a relatively primitive people, whom we need not
think of as savage or barbarous in the worst
<span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> of those words, but for whom the arts and
customs of civilization were as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> a closed

As far back as 800,000 <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> ago the Atlantean

away. The process was inaugurated at the period
just mentioned by a geological catastrophe, on a
very stupendous scale; but that merely began, it
did not accomplish, what is known to occult
history as the submergence of Atlantis. The
continent held out against the destructive forces
of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Nature</span> till about 80,000 <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> ago, when some
considerable portions surviving till then finally
disappeared, leaving one big island - the
Atlantis of classical tradition - which perished
in a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> natural convulsion about 11,500 <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span>
ago, a date originally derived from occult
teaching, and approximately confirmed by Le
Plongeon's discoveries, to which reference has
already been made.
During the enormous period covered by the gradual
submergence of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">land</span> masses of the
original continent, extensive migrations to other

accomplished by detachments of the Atlantean
people. The most spiritually enlightened and
advanced representatives of the race were
especially involved in these migrations. The
destruction of Atlantis as a <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> process was
proceeding parri passu with the moral degradation
of the people. The adepts of the race shrank away
as much from the incurable degeneration of their
countrymen as from the doomed continent <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span>
fate they foresaw. It was not in that decaying
and corrupt civilization that their influence
could any longer be exerted with advantage. They
had to discover a younger and more vigorous <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span>

which they were the custodians.
At that period a large part of Europe, especially
of eastern Europe, was an uninhabited swamp scarcely upheaved from the ocean to which

Atlantis was returning. But Egypt, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> very
different in its geography from the <span class="t28 hoverable">Egypt</span> of the
present day, was already inhabited land, as also
were the countries bounding the Mediterranean on
the east. Somewhere about the middle of the
enormous period assigned to the submergence of
Atlantis, a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> many of the Atlantean adepts,
accompanied by considerable numbers of their
uninitiated contemporaries, settled in these
countries, as also by degrees, and later on, in
the western regions of our present Europe, as

lived, is a question that I need not attempt to
deal with here. The race around them was
gradually ripened for the teachings of a lofty
civilization, and no doubt was largely augmented
and elevated ethnologically by the infusion of
the immigrant blood, for, as I have said, large
numbers of Atlantean people, besides those who
represented the adeptship of the period,

accompanied their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> leaders in their
migrations, and mingled their descendants with
the original inhabitants of their new home.
Thus, at last, a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> came when the seed sown
amongst them germinated effectually. The adepts
began to teach and rule as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as to reside in

chronicled by Manetho, are no mere fables of an
infant humanity, as the narrow-minded ignorance
of materialistic critics in the nineteenth
century too often supposes them. The <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Kings
of <span class="t28 hoverable">Egypt</span> were the early adept rulers, and the
golden age of Egyptian greatness was that over
which they presided, in millenniums far back in a
past so remote that one almost hesitates to
handle the real figures, amongst <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> of whom

emancipated from the mental fetters, as regards
the duration of the world's history, forged for
modern Europeans by the imbecile interpretation
put by the theology of the Middle Ages on
chronological statements of the Bible. In
following back the history of the earliest
monuments of Egyptian civilization, by the help
of those imperishable records still to be found,
as vivid as ever, in the Memory of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Nature</span> by
those who know how to gain access to its
boundless picture-gallery, we do not have to add
at a venture a few extra millenniums to the
conventional dates of modern Egyptlogists, but to
measure their ages on the scale of Atlantean
history. It was at a midway period between the
first immigration of Atlantean adepts in Egypt,
and the stage of the world's progress we have now
reached, that the pyramids were really built, or,
in other words, a little more than <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> hundred

were in their origin and purpose with occult
mysteries, it is impossible to obtain from

precise statement concerning the design which

they subserved in the beginning. I have gathered
a hint to the effect that, although no doubt from
the beginning <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> as and designed to be temples
or chambers of initiation - the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> pyramid,
for one, certainly containing other chambers
besides the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> that have been discovered - one
purpose of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> pyramid was the protection
of some tangible obects of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> importance
having to do with the occult mysteries. These
were buried in the rock, it is said, and the
pyramid was reared over them, its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> and

the hazards of earthquake, and even from the

earth's surface.
This brings me to one of the most remarkable
facts about the pyramids, among those which
modern research has never suspected. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">Within</span> the
enormous period of the <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> there has been

the configuration of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> about by
what some geologists, at all events, recognize as
a necessity of its constitution. The alternative
elevations and depressions of continents and
ocean beds are due to a slow pulsation of the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> of the earth, that may be likened, as
regards the surface, to the undulations of a sea
that has settled down in a condition of almost
perfect calm, but is still gently heaving under
the influence of an all but imperceptible swell.
Probably there are cross currents in such
undulations that may occasionally intensify, and
occasionally minimize them; but, at any rate,
they cannot be excluded from any reasonable
scientific hypothesis concerning the progress of
geological growth, however far beyond the reach
of our very brief historic records their last
manifestations may be withdrawn.
Occult information on the subject brings some of
them into view, and since the erection of the

earliest pyramids one such undulation - connected
with that which had to do <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the final
submergence of the last bit of the old Atlantean
Continent - depressed the region which is now the
Lower Nile valley below the level of the sea
which spread over the northern part of Africa except for the <span class="t23 hoverable">high</span> lands near the Mediterranean
coast. The west coast was also dry <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">land</span> at the
period in question, but the present desert of
Sahara was a sea, and that sea spread over the

as the huge undulation depressed its level.
The country of the Upper Nile was not submerged,
and thither no doubt the population of Egypt, to
a large extent, withdrew, although the
submergence, I understand, was cataclysmic enough
in its character to involve some destruction of
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> among those who clung longest to the menaced
region. At all events, I am told that there was a
considerable migration of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> to the east
and west, as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as to the south, and for a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span>
- I do not know exactly for how long, but for a
short <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> compared with the general course of
the undulations of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> rock-sheet of the

remained under water. Incidentally this will
suggest that the present course of the River Nile
was not that which it followed before the natural
convulsion in question. The course to-day
differs, I am told, as a <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> of fact, from
that which it followed in the age of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>
pyramid's construction as <span class="t23 hoverable">high</span> up as Thebes. The
temple of Karnac is an Egyptian monument of
enormous antiquity, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> not so old as the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> pyramid, and it never shared the
submergence of the pyramid; but as far as the
course of the river was concerned, that was
different from what it is now, even as <span class="t23 hoverable">high</span> up as
Thebes, at the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of the erection of the temple
of Karnac.
The sea again receded from lower <span class="t28 hoverable">Egypt</span> after an

interval, the exact duration of which has not
been given to me, and the pyramids were again
<span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> dry. Rapidly as compared with the geological
changes in progress, it was doubtless repeopled,
and again <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> in charge by the adept kings. I
am inclined to regard the period which now came
on as the really golden age of Egyptian
civilization. The decline did not <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> in till
much later. But Fate held another shock in
reserve for the ancient State. When the last
island remnant of Atlantis was submerged with
cataclysmic violence about 11,500 <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> ago, an
undulation of the oceans led to some enormous
inundations, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> again becoming the bed
of a sea as on the former occasion, the <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">land</span> of
<span class="t28 hoverable">Egypt</span> was overwhelmed with an immense flood,
which again dispersed its people. I do not
understand that this was on such a scale as again
to submerge the pyramids, but, at any rate, the
population was drowned or driven out of the
surrounding country - for a time. When, in turn,
this flood passed away and population spread
again over the land, there began that downward
movement of spirituality and culture which, from
the occultist's point of view, is the final brief
period of the decadence of Egyptian civilization,
though, for the modern Egyptologist, it includes
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> range of Egyptian history, behind which
some inquirers begin to look out for the
evidences of primitive man.
Probably when the decadent period began, or was
somewhat advanced, the tangible objects, whatever
they were, which the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> pyramid was designed
to cover, were removed to some other country
chosen as the headquarters of the world's
adeptship. And though, as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> as the ancient
<span class="t12 t20 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">wisdom</span> religion survived in <span class="t28 hoverable">Egypt</span> to any
considerable extent, the pyramids continued to
fulfil their purpose as temples of initiation, by
degrees, no doubt, the <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> concerning
their uses in this respect faded out from among
the people. On the face of things, it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> only

be initiated adepts that chambers dedicated to
secret ceremonies could be put to such uses, and
with the fading out of the adept element in the
population, due to its own moral deterioration,
the old traditions <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> naturally be lost. This
consideration will, amongst others, abundantly
<span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> for the multiplication of pyramids in
comparatively recent ages, when certainly, there
was no <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> on the part of the builders of
using them in connection with the introduction of
neophytes to the mysteries of occult science. As
late as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the last few <span class="t15 t23 hoverable">thousand</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> some
of the pyramids along the Nile valley have been
erected. While, therefore, occult teaching
entirely discountenances the conventional theory
that the pyramids in all cases were put up to
serve as the tombs of monarchs, it opens the door
to conjectures along that road as regards some of
the latest among them. From an antiquity with
which the decadent dynasties had probably lost
touch, the example of the earlier pyramids as a
fashion in architecture had obviously been handed
down.
Certainly the coffer of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> pyramid was
neither a sarcophagus nor, as Piazzi Smyth
conjectures, a standard measure of capacity, but
a font in which certain baptismal ceremonies
connected with initiations were carried out. It
is possible, however, that in the later and
degenerate period of Egyptian history - to which
all the Manetho dynasties belong - some of the
kings, losing touch with the ideas associated
with the more ancient pyramids in the beginning,
may have followed the fashion of their
architecture <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> knowing why it was
originally designed, and may have put up pyramids
to be their tombs. I understand definitely that
this was the case, but the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> in no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span>
militates against the explanations just given.
The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> pyramid has been assigned by most
Egyptologists to a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> of the fourth dynasty,

generally known as Cheops, or more correctly, to
students of hieroglyphics, as Khufu. That monarch
is supposed to have built it, and to have gone on
adding to its size as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> as he lived. As his
reign was a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> one, the enormous magnitude of
the building - standing on a base the size of
Lincoln's Inn Fields - is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> accounted for. My
own information is to the effect that Khufu
simply restored some portions of the pyramid that
has suffered injury, also, for reasons that I
have not <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> stated, closing up some of the
chambers that were previously accessible. It is
admitted by modern Egyptologists that the
evidence which points to Khufu as the builder of
the pyramid is meagre, although the original
guess has been quoted so often now that most
writers assume it to be somehow known as fact.
The manipulation of the enormous stones <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> in
this edifice, as also, indeed, the construction
of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> pyramid itself, can only be
explained by the application to these tasks of
some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> concerning the forces of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Nature</span>
which was lost to mankind during the decadence of
Egyptian civilization and the barbarism of the
Middle Ages, and has not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> been recovered by
modern science. This branch of the subject,
however, may be conveniently reviewed in
connection with some other architectural bequests
from the ages in which the adepts dispersed from
Atlantis were still taking part in the external
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of Egypt, and, indeed, of some other
countries now forming part of the European
continent. In England itself we have
architectural remains connected with the
ascendancy here at one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of Atlantean adepts,
the interpretation of which has been as much
clouded by fantastic theories as by the <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span>
of the ages that have gone by since their
erection.

Stonehenge is a riddle that has perplexed
speculation as profoundly in its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> as the
pyramids themselves. Most archæologists have
assumed that it was erected by the Druids of
ancient Britain, who were already disappearing as
a priestly caste at the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of the Roman
invasion, although still carrying on secret and
sanguinary rites to which some Roman historians
have referred. This somewhat crude conjecture,
which offered no explanation of the methods by
which an uncivilized race of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> like those
inhabiting the Britain that Julius Cæsar
conquered, could have handled the enormous
monoliths of which Stonehenge consists, did not
satisfy Mr. James Fergusson, who has devoted so
much painstaking research to the subject of the
Rude Stone Monuments, dealt with in his
interesting volume bearing that title. Mr.
Fergusson had a passion for discerning a recent
origin in all the remains of antiquity, and,
taking advantage of the obscurity that hangs over
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> hundred <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> of English history,
following on the abandonment of these islands by
the Romans, he has developed an elaborate
hypothesis, according to which Stonehenge was
erected in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span> Arthur, to celebrate
one of the twelve <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> battles in which that
hero is said to have overthrown the heathen. Mr.
Fergusson will have nothing to say to previous
arguments that had assigned a religious purpose
to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> relics on Salisbury Plain, and makes
them out to have been nothing more than stones
<span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> up to commemorate a victory. He could not by
any intentional efforts to that end have supplied
us with a more grotesque reductio ad absurdum of
that general <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> which regards the
civilization now around us as having grown up
from an immediately preceding condition of
primeval <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> infancy. One of the reasons for
which Mr. Fergusson rejects the Druidical theory
is derived from the impossibility of supposing
that such a mere race of savages as the Romans
found in Britain could have handled the stone

masses of which the ruin in question consists;
but he is content to <span class="t6 t9 t13 t15 t17 t18 t23 t28 t29 hoverable">pass</span> lightly over his
embarrassment in dealing with his own theory, on
the assumption that after the Roman occupation
the Britons <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have picked up a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> deal of

Romans themselves <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have been no better able
than the Britons to manipulate the materials of
Stonehenge. The "imposts" or upper stones of the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> trilithons are themselves about eleven tons
each in weight, and the uprights thirty tons
each. It is nonsense to talk of such masses as
being moved about and <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> up in their places with

mechanical resources of the present <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be
heavily taxed to erect a <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> Stonehenge beside
the first. Nor is the absurdity of such a
hypothesis measured merely by the weight of the
monoliths on Salisbury Plain. By Mr. Fergusson's
own admissions we have to <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> into our survey
of the past the remains of Stonehenge and
Avebury, and also the innumerable "dolmens" that
are found about these islands, and in larger
numbers in France, Spain, and Scandinavia. It is
no <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> to give an explanation that will fit in
with facts in one case, if it fails to square
with those of another. The dolmens have to be
accounted for as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as the Arthurian battle
memorials. And in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of some among the
dolmens the weights to be dealt with throw those
of Stonehenge into the shade. Dolmens are simple
structures, in which one mass of rock - the
capstone - is hoisted up on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> or more
supports; and one measured in Cornwall, in the
parish of Constantine, is computed to weigh 750
tons. Another in Pembrokeshire is a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> tabular
slab, big enough for five <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> on horseback to

which these strange monuments were put? The
Arthurian hypothesis leaves the <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> as much in
the dark as the Druidical theory at which Mr.
Fergusson takes offence. And the notion that the

Britons might have become qualified to raise
capstones weighing 750 tons, merely because they
had picked up some engineering skill by watching
the Roman road-makers, is too childish to
consider seriously.
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">People</span> who contend, with Mr. Fergusson, that the
rude stone monuments must have been put up in the
<span class="t7 hoverable">third</span> and fourth centuries, because we know they
have not been built since, while they could not
have been erected by primeval savages, are simply
- <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> setting out on the argument consciously
- making smooth the path that conducts us back,
in search of an explanation, to a civilization
anterior to our own, the traces of which have all
but evaporated from the records from which, till
lately, we have been constructing the history of
the ancient world. Atlantis is the only rational
clue to the comprehension of Stonehenge, just as
it affords the only satisfactory solution of
ancient Egypt.
The information on the subject to be gathered
from those to whom the Memory of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Nature</span> is an
open book, shows us the dispersed adepts from
Atlantis as the founders in Western Europe of the
religious rites that Stonehenge was designed to
subserve. At a much later period than that which
witnessed the Atlantean migration to Egypt, some
representatives of the <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> Atlantean occultism
established themselves in the country which, in
the subsequent changes of <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> geography, was
destined to become the British Isles. Their
influence established a civilization among the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> which did not prove of the strong and
enduring character attaching to that planted in
Egypt, but which, nevertheless, gave rise to
considerable cities, all traces of which have now
passed away. And Stonehenge was erected as a
temple, in which the exoteric worship they taught
to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> could be carried on. It was never
covered with any roof. Its rude structure was
purposely adopted by the exiles from Atlantis as

a mute protest against the corrupt luxury of the
perishing civilization they had <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> behind. In
Atlantis itself the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> family had touched the
nadir point of materiality. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Great</span> developments of

the service of the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> life, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span>
aspiration was entirely stifled in the pursuit of
material welfare. Personal luxury, cultivated by
those who were strong enough to secure it for
themselves, was the goal to which all the
energies of the race were bent. Many secrets of
Nature, which the science of this fifth race has
not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> recovered, were degraded to the exclusive
service of <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> enjoyment by the dominant
classes - for an inferior, servile race also
inhabited the country - and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> adepts
of the period turned with disgust from a

redeem. They <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> themselves the task of
implanting amongst a simpler and relatively
barbarous population abroad, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> descendants
were destined, in progress of time, to melt into

that might, in their case, lead on to an ennobled
future. So the external ceremonies of the
religion they taught were carried on under
guidance with stern simplicity. They built their
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> temple, of unhewn rocks. They sought no
architectural effects that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> divert attention
from Nature. They invested their cathedral with
no other claims to admiration but those depending
on the massive grandeur of its proportions.
But how did they overcome the difficulty of
manipulating the huge masses of stone, the mere
superposition of which, one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the other, seems
to have demanded mechanical resources which we
can hardly associate in imagination with any
period but our own? For that matter, in Atlantis
itself it may be found, when fuller <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> is

of that age were not exclusively dependent on
appliances of the kind we now make <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> of in
handling large masses of material. In the
maturity of Atlantean civilization some forces of
Nature, now only under the control of adepts in
occult science, were in general use. The adepts
of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> were under no obligation to keep the
secret of their <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> jealously guarded; and
among them was that power, so rarely exercised
now that its very <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> is scornfully derided
by the commonplace crowd - the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of modifying
the force we <span class="t3 t11 t18 t27 hoverable">call</span> gravity.
It is rarely of <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> in public utterances in the
present day, when current <span class="t14 t24 hoverable">intelligence</span> is engaged
in channels far removed from those of occult
attainment, to <span class="t9 t11 t20 t21 t22 t23 t27 hoverable">speak</span> of adept powers that are
wholly out of gear with modern experience of
natural possibilities. But in reference to the
peculiar <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> to which I have just referred, the

into play, can only seem absurd to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> who are

and, at the same time, wilfully blind to the
evidence of mysterious occurrences notoriously
taking place, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> altogether unexplained so
far, in the realm of spiritualistic experience.
Theosophists are, of course, very far from
accepting the theories of spiritualism in regard
to the destinies of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> after death;
but the external facts, familiar to the
investigators of spiritualism, are facts none the
less which must be fitted into their places in
any conceptions of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Nature</span> framed by intelligent
reasoning. The foolish crowd ignore these,
because impostors are constantly detected in
imitating by trickery the comparatively rare
phenomena which, under the auspices of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span>
mediumship, illustrate the occasional activity of
forces that <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> at defiance the very limited

amongst us at present. But the remark attributed
to Galileo, e pur si muove, is highly applicable
in this case. In face of all that has been
recorded by qualified spiritualistic
investigators - a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> of testimony which is not
affected in the smallest degree by exposures of
sham spiritualism in other cases - it is
curiously illustrative of the capacities of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span>
stupidity, that people, fancying themselves
clear-headed and sagacious, should continue to
discredit the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that, at <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> séances,
heavy objects are sometimes "levitated," caused,
that is, to rise or even float about in the air
under the influence of invisible agencies,or
forces that have for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> being counteracted,
as far as such objects are concerned, the usually
operative force <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> gravity.
But that which happens only now and then, no
<span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> how rarely, must be traceable, if only we
knew enough, to the operation of some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">law</span> as
natural as that under which steam expands. Nor is
there anything in the essence of the <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> more
mysterious in the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that solid objects are
sometimes repelled from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> - or levitated
- than in the other <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that more usually they
are attracted. No modern physicist has as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> any
glimmering conception as to why or how gravity
works. We are no better informed at this moment
than Newton as to why the apple falls. We can, to
a certain extent, measure the force which
controls it; we do not know what that force is.
So with magnetism. There we have an agency we can
observe in action both ways - as an attractive
and as a repulsive force. Stimulate an electromagnet in one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> and it will attract iron;
stimulate it in another <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> and it will repel
copper, so that a mass of that metal may be
visibly levitated and kept floating on nothing,
apparently, at some height above the apparatus
repelling it. Electricians observe and can
reproduce the fact; they do not understand it.
The levitation of tables and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> at

spiritual séances can only be observed
occasionally and cannot be reproduced at will not by ordinary observers, at all events - but
the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> has to be faced by reasonable men, and
<span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> into relation with our general thinking.
It is stupid to attempt an escape from the
difficulty of not understanding it by declaring,
in spite of the evidence, that the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> is not a
fact.
When, therefore, theosophists learn from those
among them in a position to become acquainted
with the powers exercised by the adepts of occult
science, that such persons can in the present
day, as of old, modify the action of the force we
<span class="t3 t11 t18 t27 hoverable">call</span> gravity, so as to levitate ordinarily heavy
objects like masses of stone, there ought not to
be any indignant revolt of the understanding
against such a statement. As <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> it is impossible
to offer the ordinary reader direct evidence to
that effect of a kind that is calculated to
compel his belief. But the general situation, as
I have shown, is such that any positive
declaration of disbelief in the allegation can
only be due to ignorance or stupidity. Therefore,
we who have what we hold to be trustworthy
information on the <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> may at least put it
forward, very careless of scoffing, which, in
<span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of collateral <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> now available,
stands self-condemned as irrational. The adept
custodians of that knowledge, concerning the
mysteries of Nature, which is filtering into the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> at large by degrees as science advances,
can and always have been able to control the
attractions of <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> in such a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> as to alter
the effective weight of heavy bodies at will.
That is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> explanation of the marvels of
megalithic architecture. Working under the
guidance and with the help of the adepts from
Atlantis, the builders of Stonehenge, and of the
ancient "dolmen" altars found the enormous masses
of stone they <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> enough to be handled
with facility. Clairvoyant observers of

Stonehenge have seen the process of its
construction going on. The pictures of its
progress are all indelibly imprinted on the
Memory of Nature: they are visible now, as
plainly as the actual transactions were visible
for those who were present. And the vision shows
us the enormous masses of the trilithons being
raised to their places with the help of
scaffoldings, no more substantial in their
character than <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> in the
erection of a brick cottage.
Of course, although I did not interrupt my
narrative of the origin of the pyramids to say
so, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> stones of which they are composed
were treated in the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> as the materials of
Stonehenge. The adepts who directed their
construction facilitated the process by the
partial levitation of the stones used. This is
the simple, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> in one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> no doubt deeply
mysterious, explanation of the old-world
monuments in which enormous masses of stone are
employed. At the temple of Baalbec, in Syria,
there are single stones built into the walls,
each of which is calculated to weigh about 1,500
tons. Preferring an explanation of such remains
which only seem reasonable because it makes no
appeal to forces and powers with which we are
unacquainted, archæologists have hitherto been
content to assume that, with an unlimited command
of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> labour, the builders of such temples as
that of Baalbec may have been able to get their
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> stones dragged along causeways on rollers,
and may somehow have hoisted them up into their
places with the help of inclined planes. Such
hypotheses make larger drafts <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> credulity
really than those involved in the occult
statement. They <span class="t3 t11 t18 t27 hoverable">call</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> us to believe that
which is physically impossible; but the
impossibility is acceptable because it is
disguised in commonplace phraseology. Stonehenge
and Baalbec really stand before us imperishable
proofs that, in the age of their construction,

whenever that may have been, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> was
witness of an engineering which did not
accomplish its triumphs by brute strength, but by
the application of a finer <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> than even

I have said that it was at a much later period
than that at which the Atlantean adepts, who
first <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> the perishing continent, <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> up their
residence in Egypt, that those who settled in
Western Europe <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> on foot the grand and simple
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> worship which Stonehenge in the first
instance was employed to subserve. It was at a
much later period even that that at which the
pyramids were erected. I do not know <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span>
there was any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> residence by Atlantean adepts
in Western Europe prior to the introduction of
their teaching among the people. Probably there
was, but, at all events, it was near the final
culmination of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Atlantean continent's
submergence, about 100,000 <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> ago from the
present time, that the grey stones still standing
on Salisbury Plain were first established in
their places. Among the facts concerning them,
which supporters of Fergusson's grotesque theory
have to <span class="t6 t9 t13 t15 t17 t18 t23 t28 t29 hoverable">pass</span> over very lightly, is one which
relates to the geological character of the stones
used. The outer circle and the stones of the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> trilithons are of a composition that
suggest their derivation from quarries in the
neighbourhood. But the inner circle and the altar
stone are of a totally different formation, of a
kind which cannot be identified with any rockbeds
in that part of England. Such stone is to be
found in Cornwall, in Wales, and in Ireland, but
nowhere nearer. So from one of these regions the
materials of the inner circle must certainly have
been brought. Reasoning of the kind that is never
shocked by an absurdity, but is only offended by
the suggestion that modern <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> does not
embrace all the capacities of Nature, is content
complacently to suppose that the Stonehenge
builders <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> the massive materials in

question across many hundred miles of primeval
forest-covered country, or, by sea - all for the
sake of a battle memorial on Salisbury Plain when abundant stone, just as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> and durable,
was to be had in the neighbourood. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of
the Stonehenge materials <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be alone enough to
make the Arthurian theory ridiculous, even if it
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> bear consideration along other lines of
attack. For the purposes of a mystic temple,
however, everyone who has a glimmering of occult
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> will apprehend that there may have been
considerations connected with those subtle
attributes of different kinds of stone, which
occultists generally <span class="t3 t11 t18 t27 hoverable">call</span> their magnetism, that
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> prescribe the employment of more than one
kind.
The worship of the early Druids, to give that
name to the occult teachers who made Stonehenge
their headquarters, was grandiose and simple.
There were processions and chaunts and symbolical
ceremonies associated with astronomical events,
especially with the rising of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> on

assembled to witness the sun's rays, at the
moment of his rising, shoot through an opening
opposite to the altar, and illuminate the sacred
stone. There were no unholy sacrifices offered on
the altar in those days, and the only external
ceremony of a sacrificial <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> that <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span>
had to do with a libation of milk that was poured
over the stone. In accordance with the elaborate
symbolism of early occult rites, a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> deal of
importance was attached to the serpent as an
emblem of multifarious significance, and as the
adept Druids could easily control these
creatures, an actual living serpent was made to
glide up into the altar stone at the sunrise
ceremony, and lap the milk. There is some truth,
but much more misconception, in prevailing
notions concerning what is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the "Serpent
Worship" of olden times. The failure of modern
students of religion to discriminate between

worship and <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> of symbols has to do with graver
misconceptions even than those which have
entangled the commonplace interpretations of
serpent worship.
The chief Druid of the Stonehenge ceremonies in
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">days</span> of the pure worship in the beginning
<span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> to march in some of the processions with a
live serpent round his neck. Later on, when the
adept influence was no longer present - many
milleniums later - the degraded chiefs of the
Druid decadence <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> to keep up the old tradition
in so far as it lay in them to do so, but for
prudential reasons wore a dead serpent - a more
fitting emblem than they supposed of the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of
<span class="t4 t7 t12 t16 hoverable">faith</span> they represented. Lower and lower its
practices became debased, until the once sacred
altar stone was deluged no longer with milk, but
with the blood of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> victims, and this was the
only sort of Druid worship of which, through
Roman historians, we have any <span class="t0 t11 t24 hoverable">written</span> records.
How did it happen that so terrible a change came
on? The age apparently, as far as ancient Britain
was concerned, was not sufficiently advanced to
provide the earlier adepts with a continuous line
of successors. Eventually, it is to be presumed,
one by one, no doubt, the earlier adepts ceased
to incarnate among the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> they could not lead

<span class="t28 hoverable">Egypt</span> the graft they planted <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> a firm hold of
the stock to which it was attached. In Britain it
did not, and thus, while <span class="t28 hoverable">Egypt</span> remained to a

THEOSOPHICAL TEACHINGS LIABLE TO BE
MISUNDERSTOOD
IN the beginning of our theosophical studies we
had to be content with very crude conceptions
concerning the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> ideas to which we were then
introduced. It was not possible for those who
were endeavouring to teach us to convey to us,
all at once, a comprehension of those <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span>
planes of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> some understanding of which is
absolutely necessary to a correct appreciation of
even some fundamental principles that we have to
deal with. Indeed, that embarrassment has, it
seems to me, impeded all attempts at metaphysical
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> that have antedated the theosophical
movement. Intensely keen intellectual activity
has been devoted to the effort to penetrate "the
Veil of Isis," to outstrip the range of <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span>
senses, to determine the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of matter, and to
analyze process of thought. But it has all
amounted to very little as compared with the
flood of significant teaching that we have been
able to obtain during the theosophical period.
With the help of this, by degrees, it has come to
<span class="t6 t9 t13 t15 t17 t18 t23 t28 t29 hoverable">pass</span> that, in spite of the enormous difficulty of
grappling in imagination with conditions of
<span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> outside those with which we are
familiar, we have gradually been able to surround
some of the earlier teaching with illumination
which invests it with fuller <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> than we
could attach to it at first. We have <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> come to
realize that some of our earlier conceptions,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> not erroneous - indeed, no teaching that I
have had to do with, as given to us in the
beginning, need at this later date be withdrawn
as erroneous - were incomplete to that extent
that they have given rise to misunderstandings;
and the attempt to clear up some of those
misunderstandings is the task on which I am now
venturing to enter.
Foremost amongst theosophical teachings liable to

be misunderstood - for want of adequate
comprehension concerning conditions of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span>
hereafter and on <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> planes - stands that
fundamental idea, Reincarnation, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">law</span>
which from earliest beginnings of theosophical
study we have realized as an essential principle
of evolution. Not only among theosophists has the
idea been appreciated. It is even surprising,
considering how much there is in the idea to
excite repugnance on the part of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> who do
not understand it properly, that it has made <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span>
to the extent that we have seen, gradually
conquering acceptance more widely than
theosophical teaching does this generally. It has
frequently been defended in pulpits as not
incompatible with ordinary religious teaching; it
has been accepted by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> quite outside the
range of theosophical influence, as the only
possible explanation of what seems terrible
injustice reigning in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> - the mysterious
inequalities of condition that we see around us,
the differences not merely of welfare, but of
moral and intellectual development, of
environment, and so forth, which render <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span>
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> so painfully variegated. But theoretical
acceptance of the idea has not always rendered it
welcome to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> who want to realize precisely
how the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">law</span> will <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> when they come to be
reincarnated, who are troubled with anxieties in
that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> that render the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> conception
exceedingly repulsive. They persist in thinking
of themselves as plunged afresh into babyhood, as
coming back with the <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> they are now
invested with, to be again subject to the
appalling limitations of the infant conditon.
They think of themselves as fretting against the
limitations of the baby state, wearingly enduring
their slow progress towards maturity. We have to
get rid of all such ideas absolutely and entirely
before we understand what reincarnation means,
and the first difficulty in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> of getting
rid of them, has to do with the distinction
between the personality of any given <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> and the

Ego of which that personality is a temporary
expression.
As we approach an understanding of this
distinction a new difficulty is apt to spring up.
When told that the personality of any given <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span>
is going to be merged in the Ego - as we are
definitely assured will be the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> as a rule to the extent that the details of the last <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span>
will fade by degrees from memory, that seems to
imply something resembling the annihilation of
personal consciousness, the only kind which seems
real, as contemplated from the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> plane
point of view. The same comfortless <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span>
surrounds a mistaken conception that has
sometimes been put forward in regard to the
ultimate destinies of humanity at the conclusion
of the Manvantara, the alleged re-absorption in
that Divinity out of which in the beginning
humanity emerged. Of course, if personalities
even remotely resembling what they are now were
absorbed into Divinity, as a drop of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> is
absorbed in the ocean, that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be equivalent
to annihilation, and mergence in the Ego when the
personality is passing on from this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> to
another seems, again, a species of annihilation,
for most <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> unable to escape, in imagination,
from the conditions of the current personality.
Now what we have to remember, first of all, in
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> to get rid of that misconception, is that
protracted and vivid conditions of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> intervene
between the disappearance from this plane of any
given personality and the next presentation of
the Ego on the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> plane in accordance with
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">law</span> of rebirth. A very <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> interval elapses
before the personality with which we are
associated in any given <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> has accomplished its
mergence in the Ego. I have dealt to some extent
with that subject on former occasions, but it
requires continued attention. Remember that,
first of all, we have a considerably protracted
experience, which may extend to enormous length

sometimes - of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> in which the personality is

next incarnation for much more extended
activities of a similar order. In a minor degree
the same explanation applies to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> of less

condition. We must not think of this <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> as
in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of a <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> death.

from all the anxieties and distrust that, to
often, embitter the approach of <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span>
dissolution, and it is hardly necessary to stay
utterly <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> from the suffering so often
attending departure from this plane. During

contributed to make up the personality have faded
away. Its <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> emotions, its <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t8 t13 t15 t17 t18 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> energies, its
intellectual capacities remain unimpaired, but it
has already shed most of the minor attachments

arising from its earthly life. It is getting
ready for that union with the Ego which must not
be <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> of as accomplished at once on leaving
this plane of life. Whatever desires may have
been engendered for the continuance of personal
existence, those desires will operate to retain
vivid <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> of personality on appropriate
levels of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> for as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> as their force can
persist. But, as I say, the Ego, the real
permanent self, is a more permanent <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> than
any one personality, and, however important any
given personality may be compared with those that
have preceded it in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> career of the Ego
through nature, its importance has to be
expressed in a new environment, to clear the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span>
for which the minor details of the last
incarnation have been allowed to fade away, or
evaporate. But the Ego and the personality must
not be <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> of as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> separate entities. The
personality is, at all events, a partial
expression of the Ego and, sooner or later, the
Earth-plane <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> is withdrawn into the
Ego, sometimes rapidly, sometimes after a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span>
interval, but eventually in all <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> that has to
be accomplished. And the blending means the
absorption into the Ego of all that was important
in the personality that has lately been spent.
There is another interesting <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> connected
with that idea. Sooner or later a personality may
become so important that it is perpetuated, so to
speak, and invests the Ego with its own
colouring, instead of assuming from the Ego the
colouring of former accumulated experiences.
That, of course, will only happen at the
threshold of a very exalted condition of
development, and it does not apply to the
majority of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> at the present stage of our
life.
I must now go back for a moment to the
misunderstanding about baby consciousness. It is
quite possible that some of you may have read

accounts of strange experiences that have
sometimes been known in the Eastern <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> - I am
thinking especially of some cases in Tibet where babies who have been recognized as
reincarnations of a former incarnation have
actually been able to prove their identity by
pointing out hiding places in which the former
personality had stowed away various objects, with
a <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> to its ultimate identification. And, in
some cases, the actual baby <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> has uttered
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> identifying itself with the former
incarnation. That need not be <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> of as
conflicting with what I just now said. Whenever
that has <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> - and I believe it has <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span>
place; I do not want to repudiate the stories it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> represent a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> adept achievement from
the background, so that it may be <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> aside
altogether as inapplicable to ordinary life. And
almost equally inapplicable to ordinary <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> are
the cases in which very young children, before
the age of seven, have been known to exhibit
extraordinary faculties. I think these have
generally had to do with the reincarnation of
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> musicians. We are all familiar with the
precocity of Mozart, who is said to have begun
playing the piano at six <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> of age. In
reference to these one can only say again that
they are altogether abnormal. Merely guessing at
the previous conditions that might explain such
cases, I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> suggest that they represent an
intense eagerness on the part of the Ego to
express, on the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> plane, some of the
musical ideas gathered from experience on the
Manasic level. We have always been led to believe
that on the Manasic level music somehow pervades
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> region, appealing, of course, in very
varying degrees to different aptitudes, but
filling the <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> of the advanced
musician with musical ideas he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be eager to
reproduce. Probably in a similar way, when the
mathematical faculty has become the leading
mental characteristic of an Ego, that condition
may equally impel the Ego to seek an early

opportunity for its expression on the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span>
plane, and may <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> for the "calculating
boys" one has sometimes <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> of; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> we have
in connection with such cases to explain, the
best we can, the usual <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that the abnormal
faculty disappears or weakens as the boy grows
up. Such facts <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> us into relation with a
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> volume of Nature's mysteries, which show
how, at early stages of evolution, there seems to
be a closer connection with the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> plane
than when fuller intellectual development has
been reached. Babies, animals, and early savage
tribes will sometimes give evidence of possessing
glimmerings, at all events, of astral perception
which fade away at later stages of growth.
I come now to consider various possibilities
which have to do with the re-attachment of the
Ego to a bodily manifestation. In the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of
Egos sufficiently advanced along the path of that
progress to which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> is so conducive, it
may be possible for the <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> self, if I may <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span>
that expression, or the Ego - I am using the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span>
terms as almost synonymous - to exercise a
definite choice in regard to the new incarnation
on which it will enter. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">People</span> already at some
stage "on the path," especially if they are

ordinary <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">law</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> provide for, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> probably
have a considerable range of choice in regard to
the incarnation they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> accept. I have been
priviliged to obtain some information bearing
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> cases that have actually occurred, and a
curious discovery emerges. In all such cases of
which I have heard, where several opportunities
have lain before an Ego coming into incarnation some apparently very much less attractive than
others - it seems almost invariably the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> that
the Ego chooses the least desirable incarnation,
as its desirability <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be measured from our
point of view. Incarnations in humble <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span>
involving a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> deal of what, from our point of
view, we should consider hardship and undesirable

conditions have continually, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> my knowledge,
been chosen by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> of sufficient advancement
to exercise a choice, in preference to those
representing more agreeable conditions of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> on
this plane. From the Ego point of <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> nothing is
of really any importance compared with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span>
growth and progress, and it may not infrequently
happen that the humbler incarnation is, first of
all, calculated to get rid of Karma that lies in
the background, while it also not infrequently
happens that the humbler incarnation is
distinctly more conducive to devotion to
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> and effort than those where
pleasures and distractions of all kinds keep
people's thoughts centred on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> that they
are actually leading. And again it may happen <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> I am now about to <span class="t9 t11 t20 t21 t22 t23 t27 hoverable">speak</span> of a <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> that is
probably unique - that some definite <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> that a
highly evolved Ego has undertaken can be better
carried out in a humble than in an exalted
station of life. Most students of philosophical
literature will be more or less familiar with the
writings of that wonderful German philosopher
Jacob Boehme. Now Jacob Boehme's writings show
him to have been on the threshold, at all events,
of <span class="t23 hoverable">high</span> Adeptship, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> in that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> he was a
humble cobbler, just a subordinate worker at that
humble trade. Why did he choose such an
incarnation as that? - for it is certain that a
Being on his level must have chosen his
incarnation. The answer I understand to be that
at the period in which he lived it was not
desirable that the teachings he had to put
forward - real theosophic teachings, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> not

Only a few were ripe for them. It was held to be
necessary that they should be suggested, so to
speak, from a humble level of mundane authorship.
I am not presuming to endorse or criticize that
idea. I merely <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> it as given to me in
explanation of the Jacob Boehme incarnation. "But

why," I asked, "such a very ignoble position as
that of a working cobbler?" The answer, I believe
derived from himself, was - "No position can be
ignoble in which you are fulfilling the purpose
of the Logos." That seems to me to have been an
extremely beautiful answer, radiant with <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span>
that can be applied to many of the phenomena of
life. True, there are not many working cobblers
who are Jacob Boehmes in disguise, and we must
not be hurried into conclusions to the effect
that it is only on such levels of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> natures are to be sought for. Indeed,
the normal rule is rather the other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> about.
There is a tendency in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Nature</span> to a gradual upward

incarnations. This ensues from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> in which
desire, in ordinary life, is one of the factors
making up the next Karmic programme. The <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span>
must be clear and definite to be operative in
this way, and it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> not amount to much if a
costermonger desired to be a king. He <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> not
know enough about the king's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> to <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> that
with precision, nor even if his <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> pointed to
a less exalted station could it be definite
enough to have a Karmic value. But he may fully
realize the conditions of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> a little better
than those he might be <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> to, and then the
<span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> assumes creative force, always supposing
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> does not engender, in other directions,
bad Karma that conflicts with his desire. But all
these last remarks obviously apply to levels of
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> below those inspired by genuine <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span>
aspiration. When this is sufficiently developed
for the Ego to feel it as his predominant motive,
it sweeps away all minor ambitions.
So, as I say, on the <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> levels choice enters
into this matter. When it does not enter - which
is the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> with the vast majority of our fellowcreatures - the guidance is accomplished again in
various ways. For those sufficiently advanced,
but not on the path, there are <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> in

whose function it is to direct incarnations and
actually guide each Ego, with a perception of its

for its further expression. On a lower level
again, if we go back to the conditions of savage
life, or even to the conditions of very humble

as I have definitely been told, for a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> many

equally well, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> there is no specific
individual guidance in such cases. You will
always remember that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> race is a vast
procession proceeding through the ages, the
members of which represent very different
conditions of growth and progress, very different
claims <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the authority which rules the whole.
Let us consider the course of events in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span>
of an ordinary Ego representing civilized
development, a certain amount of progress along
the lines of evolution and intelligence, and so
forth, but no abnormal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> growth. Such an
Ego will be drafted into an appropriate
incarnation under pressure of forces of which it
has no practical consciousness, and for a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span>
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> will be unconscious of having re-entered
this plane of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> at all. There is a link
established between itself and the new <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> - we
do not know what terms to use, <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> plane

suit these conditions - but some mysterious
magnetic thread or tie attaches the Ego to the
new birth, and for a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> it is quite
unconscious of any such attachment - unconscious
probably for at least seven years. The first
seven <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> of a child's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> do not represent
intelligent <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> that organism.
Perhaps that statement will shock enthusiastic
mothers who believe that from a very early age
they detect all sorts of charming attributes in
their offspring. They may, but I do maintain from
what I have been told that as far as the real Ego
<span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> is concerned it is not really
active <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the child until at least seven

years have been spent, and then only to a very
limited degree. Then, no doubt, the Ego will be
conscious of its re-attachment to the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span>
plane, but not conscious to any extent which is a
serious impediment to its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span>
on <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> planes. It will not be until another
septenary period has been passed - for these
septenary periods have a very definite
significance in connection with the growth of new
lives - it is not until another stage of distinct
progress has been accomplished that the etheric
and astral elements in the new child's
composition become identified with the Ego in the
background. I am not going to attempt a very
minute explanation of the successive stages
through which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Nature</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> in bringing an Ego
into a new incarnation, but the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> septenary
periods that I have mentioned are by no means all
that are recognizable as stages in the process.
The real <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> I believe to be that it is not
until <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span> maturity is reached, not till such an
age as twenty-eight, or even a later period than
that, that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> elements in the Ego are
capable of functioning in the new organism. I
believe, even as far as the period of thirtyfive, it may sometimes be said that the new
incarnation is not absolutely in its completely
perfected condition. So that no conception of
this subject can be more wide of the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> than
that which embarrasses the idea of reincarnation
with the belief that, in the earlier stages, the
experience is distressing to the entity coming
back.
One or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> other thoughts still remain to be
emphasized in connection with this process of
reincarnation. A <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> deal was said in earlier
writings on the subject of Devachan, and later
interpretations have modified <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span>
contradicting what was said in the beginning.
There are numerous cases in which Devachan is
little more than a blissful idleness in which the
personality that has passed from this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> into

the Devachan state, exists in a perfectly happy
condition for as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> a period as the energies
<span class="t16 hoverable">created</span> or <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> into activity during the past

<span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> plane. In all such cases the mergence into
the Ego is effected unconsciously. All such
processes are guided by <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> <span class="t14 t24 hoverable">intelligence</span>
outside that of the Ego itself, and it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> only
be in a very advanced condition indeed that the

doing as it gradually absorbed into itself the
experiences of the last life. You have always to
remember that on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> conditions that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span>

on much lower levels, what we may <span class="t3 t11 t18 t27 hoverable">call</span> the common
levels of nature, operating in a vast area, they
are guided for us by <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> of a lower <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> in
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> hierarchy.
A <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> deal was said in the beginning of our
studies in reference to the periods which usually
elapse between incarnations. In my own first <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">book</span>
on the subject, those who have read it may
remember that I spoke - under guidance of course
- of the intervening period which applied to the
average of mankind, as running from 1,500 to
2,000 years, during which, of course, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> was
divided between astral conditions and Devachanic
or Manasic conditions. Only after this very ample
scope had been given for the exhaustion of all
the forces of the previous <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> did the entity
come back into incarnation. There was nothing
untrue in that statement at the time, but a very
remarkable condition of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> has arisen since
that statement was put forward. We live in a very
remarkable period, remarkable not merely for its
extraordinary development of theosophical

in other ways as well, and amongst other features
that are remarkable in this period is the

extraordinary acceleration of all processes which
have to do with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> evolution. I think we have
many of us noticed this acceleration as applied
to the phenomena of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> around us, even in
reference to the changes that have been going on
on the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> plane. Looking back over the past
fifty <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> we see that immense progress has been
made in science, in discovery, in moral
development, in religious <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> all over the
world; and that acceleration has been going on
with even greater rapidity and energy on the
<span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> planes of nature. It has to do, of course,
with the difference between the downward and the
upward arcs of evolution. On the downward arc of
evolution - the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> preparatory process of
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> - progress is slow; on the upper arc of
the cycle it is quick, and we are beginning now,
having turned the corner as regards this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span>
period, to feel the accelerating influence of the
upward arc of evolution; and the accelerating
influence, I am told, has definitely operated
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the last thirty years, to accelerate the
return to incarnation of such <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> as we are
talking about when we <span class="t9 t11 t20 t21 t22 t23 t27 hoverable">speak</span> of civilized
communities. I leave out of <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> those who are
on the Path; a condition that probably applies to
a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> many of my readers, <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> they are fully
aware of it or not, most likely to a majority of
those who <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> a real, deep and serious interest
in theosophical teaching. They come under the

incarnation may be accelerated far beyond any
such periods as we have been talking about. But
dealing with the general run of civilized
mankind, the acceleration is producing this
effect: for a considerable <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> of advanced
Egos in the civilized world, a period of only
about <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> hundred <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> is now going to be an
average period for the intervening <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> between

course, a somewhat less evolved condition of
either <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> or intellectual growth, a seven
hundred year period is going to be the average,

and for probably a still larger <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span>
representing normal conditions of ordinary <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> a

instead of that fifteen hundred year period which
prevailed during the earlier part of the last

leading to the <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> life, who are coming to
appreciate the openings of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> that have
been available for us in recent years. In former
times such <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> were more numerous in the
Eastern than in the Western world; and the
consequence <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> to be that incarnations drifted,
in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> with distinct <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span>
aspiration, from the Western <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> to the
Eastern. Indeed, when our theosophical teaching
began to excite interest here, I know that some
of my own friends aspired to Eastern incarnations
as probably conducive to more rapid <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span>
growth than could be accomplished in any other
way. That idea I think was an erroneous
aspiration so far as it applied to any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span>

of date. The drift of incarnation for those who
represent exalted conditions of preparedness for
<span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> things, is now rather from the East to the
West. The <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> of the <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> is that, although
we are so far only concerned with beginnings, the
Western <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> is going, in by no means a remote

civilized world; and therefore, as I say, at the
present <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> such an aspiration as that which I
referred to a while ago as operative with some of
my earlier friends in connection with
theosophical study, the <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> for Eastern
incarnations, is wholly out of date. What we have
to do now is to recognize the duties that are
gradually coming to be incumbent on the Western
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> in connection with the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> progress
of mankind.
Looking back to the beginning of civilization, to
the Atlantean period, when there was not any
Europe to talk about at all, all the development,
such as it was, both <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> and intellectual,
was centred in the Atlantean world. Of course the
Atlantean population gradually spread over the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> of the habitable globe, and all that we now
<span class="t9 t11 t20 t21 t22 t23 t27 hoverable">speak</span> of as the Eastern <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> was, please to
remember, once Atlantean. Earlier sub-races of
the Atlantean period accounted for the earliest
populations, <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> of India, of any part of
Central Asia, or of any part of the Eastern
world, and as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> civilization of
Atlantis became defiled by the growth of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> in
the shape of what we commonly <span class="t3 t11 t18 t27 hoverable">call</span> black
tendencies, so the best representatives of
advanced Atlantean spirituality migrated
eastward, and in that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> established in the

condition of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> lasted for a very <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> while.
Of course at a period which again is a very <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span>

migrating from Atlantis proper to escape the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span>
developments of its civilization, established
themselves in Egypt, they met another stream of
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> civilization flowing west-ward from
India and regions beyond India that had been
engendered, so to speak, by the fermentation of

loftier <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> in the earlier races of the
Atlantean period. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> when Atlantis ultimately
disappeared and was destroyed by <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> of the
<span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that it had become so utterly degraded, you
have to think of the Eastern <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> as wholly
representative of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> growth. But we also
have to recognize as an absolute <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that in the
progress of sub-racial development later subraces than any of those which now occupy the
Eastern <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> have been developed and evolved in
what is now the Western world. So now the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>
wave of spirituality is sweeping back again
towards the West. Ex oriente lux! From the East
the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> is coming. But the very <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> of that
phrase indicates that it is moving westward. Some
Western Americans are fond of a boastful

the Star of Empire - but westward the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>

distinctly moving. And we have to be worthy, as
it were, of that condition of things; we have to
rise to meet it.
If we properly appreciate our functions, they are
much more dignified than at the first glance
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> believe. The Theosophical <span class="t1 hoverable">Society</span> is
charged with the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> task of leading <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span>
progress in the Western world. The <span class="t1 hoverable">Society</span> is a
nucleus which in future generations, at no very
distant period, will be enormously expanded
beyond its present conditions, expanded let us
trust by virtue of the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that those who are
now concerned with it will appreciate the duties
incumbent on them, and act in a manner which may
pave the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> for that further development which
undoubtedly is contemplated by <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">Higher</span> Powers as
the programme of the future. That can be carried
out if we can respond adequately to the influence
that they are radiating.
That is the most important <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> that I have to
deal with just now, but there are one or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span>

other minor matters having to do with
misconceptions or misunderstandings of
theosophical teaching, which seem trivial and
almost trumpery compared with those which I have
been talking about, but which none the less claim
notice. I am referring to views which are
sometimes put forward, connecting aspirations for
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> growth and progress with questions
relating to what we <span class="t28 hoverable">eat</span> and drink or refrain from
eating and drinking. Now this is a very delicate
subject which has been a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> deal discussed by
theosophical writers lately, and in reference to
which I am very anxious not to be misunderstood
myself by theosophical friends. No one can
entertain a more definitely appreciative
admiration for what may roughly be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span>
superior or cleaner modes of life, as compared
with those of the multitude, that I myself; but I
do venture to say - and I say it on authority
that I respect - that however beautiful in its
conception purer diet may be, that "perfect <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span>
in diet" that Mrs. Kingsford so admirably wrote
about many <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> ago has nothing to do with
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> progress. That is all that I am driving
at. Do not let <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> who, <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> for reasons of
health, conveninence, family environment, or for
any other reasons worthy of consideration, <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span>
it difficult to adopt the rules of the perfect

by disregarding them. That is all I am
emphasizing. The all-important consideration in
regard to <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> - I am not speaking now
of the moral attributes that should guide our
conduct in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> - our all-important duty in
regard to the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> instrument with which we
have to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> when we are trying to do the right
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> in this life, is that we should keep it in
health. And at the present time, when most of our
bodies - not our Egos, but most of our bodies may have come down through a line of heredity
familiarized with the old-fashioned diet, it does
not always happen that the present

representatives of that line can be healthy on an
entirely new régime. That is the important point
to remember. Your duty, so to speak, to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span>
is to keep it in health, and you must determine
for yourself what particular course of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> in
regard to this <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> of eating and drinking is
best calculated to have that effect. I have made
efforts to get information on this subject from
exalted teachers. I think I have succeeded, and
of course what I have been saying to you is the
outcome of such success. Going more into detail,
it may be recognized that in a certain very
limited <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> it is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> that what, for want of a
better term, we <span class="t3 t11 t18 t27 hoverable">call</span> "magnetism" of a bad <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span>
does attach to meat as a food. It has a very
slight influence, and I am told that those who
look on from a <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> plane at the efforts of
some vegetarian thinkers to follow the perfect
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> in diet, are rather amused to see that they
ignore this question of magnetism as between
various kinds of vegetable food. If there is any
point in the idea that certain foods have a bad
magnetism, then certain kinds of vegetable foods
have a bad magnetism to just the same extent as
meat, and in neither <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> does that <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span>
seriously. The same applies to alcohol with
slightly greater emphasis. And again the question
is <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> heredity is of such an <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span>
as to render any particular <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> incapable of
maintaining health and efficiency for whatever
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> it has to do, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> some little of that
otherwise undesirable beverage.
One other theory claims notice in this connection
- that which relates to the habit of smoking. Let
nobody be under the impression - if they are
inclined to attach any importance to the
information I have been priviliged to obtain that there is any harm in that practice in regard
to the conditions it engenders in the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span>
body, in reference to health, to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> or
moral progress, or to any of the loftier duties
of life. It is perfectly harmless; it has no bad

effect on astral or etheric conditions - in
moderation of course. We always assume that we
are talking to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> who are not going to
extremes in the pursuit of any pleasures of a
<span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> order. But <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> reasonable limits that
particular practice, I am told, has a rather
beneficial effect than otherwise on the etheric
conditions of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> who live in modern
communities, <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span> of astral swirls of all kinds
and of a complicated order. There remains only
one other remark to make on this subject, that of
course in reference to smoking, however agreeable
and innocent it may be in itself, nobody who is
thinking along the lines that are probably
operative with theosophical students <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> dream
of doing anything of that kind in a manner which
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be disagreeable to others. That is the clue
to the correct understanding of this matter. It
hinges on to very much loftier principles,
because the idea that we should do nothing for
our own sake which is injurious to the comfort or
welfare of other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> is a crude <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> of putting
the fundamental conception which has to do with
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> progress in all its aspects. We are not
segregated atoms in consciousness, living only
for our individual selves; we are simply parts of
a stupendous design, the identity of ourselves
with which at some future period we shall fully
realize, as we may now even intellectually
appreciate it. That idea can never be
misunderstood, because of its utter simplicity.
Simple on this plane, it is equally simple and
equally <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> on planes above, and is the one idea
which, if it thoroughly saturates our
understanding, and becomes the guide of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> and

knowledge; not finality along the lines of its
own activity, but finality as regards the
character of such knowledge, held to be
necessarily limited by the resources of <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span>
sense. Philosophy even, vaguely conscious of

something beyond the characteristics of matter,
did not hesitate to describe whatever lay beyond
the reach of <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> research as "unknowable,"
and those who ventured to attempt the exploration
of the unseen or intangible mysteries of Nature,
did so at the expense of being treated with
contempt by the orthodox opinion of their time.

themselves in possession of certain <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> to
the effect that it is possible to communicate
with those who have been passed on to other
states of existence, are to be counted by
millions both in Europe and America. Their
conviction does not imply that it is always
possible to command such communication in
individual cases. The laws relating to all such
methods are, as yet, but imperfectly understood;
but the broad certainty that, under some

enough to establish the main principle that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span>
<span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> survives the change <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> death,
and it is impossible to overrate the value of the
widespread conviction to that effect permeating
our civilization, in which the progress of
<span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> science was tending in the opposite
direction, while the influence of religious
teaching was insufficient to counteract that
tendency. Concurrently with the growth of
confidence in the main idea represented by
spiritualism, the various manifestations of
Nature's finer forces operative amongst those
still in <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> have been steadily
securing attention. Psychic research became, by
degrees, not merely emancipated from the
intolerance it formerly encountered, but has been
gradually established amongst us as almost a
fashionable pursuit. Mesmerism, so fiercely
flouted in the beginning, became recognized, in

some of its aspects, at all events, as a curative
agent in some conditions of disease, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span>
ill-understood as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> by those who only know it
under the modern and misleading designation
"hypnotism," is actually recognized as a system
of treatment by many orthodox practitioners. And,
sharing in the growing changes of opinion, the
fascination of fortune-telling in all its
varieties has proved only too attractive to many
enthusiasts of our generation. Finally we have to
recognize that in the scientifc <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> itself, a
few, at all events, of those most distinguished
in research, and many indeed beside those who
have had the courage to acknowledge their
conviction, are conscious already that they are
standing on the threshold of a new scientifc
dispensation, in which super-physical laws and
super-physical faculties must be made available
by those <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> destiny it may be to expound the
natural philosophy of the future. Problems
connected with the ether, the electron, and
unseen emanations from the Sun, credited with the
production of those curious phenomena known as
magnetic storms, are all of them imperatively in
need of illumination of a kind that can only be
derived from super-physical investgation. The
present situation is <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span> of promise for
developments, at no distant future, which will
involve in the embrace of recognized science the
resources and achievements of occultism.
That is the change that has <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span>
the last five and twenty or thirty years. Beyond
the influence of spiritualism, to which I have
already referred, what are the other influences
which have <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> it about?
I am not eager to claim credit in any exclusive
degree or to any predominant extent for the
literature which, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the period to which I
refer, has been devoted to the exposition of that
teaching generally known as Theosophy, but it

has not been attributable, in some measure, to
the wide diffusion of that clearly-defined,
coherent, scientific interpretation of a vast

which I have been endeavouring to trace, no one
who has adequately studied theosophical teaching
will deny that for the first <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> in the overt

with a complete theory of life; reaching back to
its beginnings, reaching forward to its
possibilities, and incidentally foreshadowing the
ultimate synthesis into a complete science of
super-physical nature, of all the miscellaneous
phenomena with which psychic research is
concerned. Spiritualism established the reality
of a future life, but aimed, I venture to think,
as regards its original inspiration, at nothing
more. Occult research, independently of
spiritualism, has established the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span>
consciousness, still expressed in incarnation,
has resources at its disposal far transcending in
their significance the senses of the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span>

conclusions, has illuminated, for our benefit,
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> scheme of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> evolution, the laws

on this <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> plane of existence, and the
growth of the soul, under the influence of the
experience which those successive manifestations
afford. No hurried phrases of this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> can

The phrase I have employed as the title of this
essay may not at once be intelligible, but if I
had not shrunk from expanding it to inconvenient
length, I should have rendered it more
unintelligible still by employing the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span>
with a double signification, proposing to deal,
not merely with the super-physical aspect of
natural forces, but also with the natural aspect
of super-physical forces. The inversion of the
phrase may not at once convey a specific meaning,
but I venture to think that before I have done
its significance will be clearly appreciated, and
in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> that what I have to say may be at once

intelligible in its bearing on the main idea, let
me explain very concisely at the outset the
conclusions I shall endeavor to reach.
I want to show, first of all, that the forces
with which we are all familiar, in their
relationship with matter, the laws of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Nature</span> as
they are commonly called, can only be correctly
understood if we think of them as the expression
of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Will consciously operating to produce
the effects we observe, and, secondly, that while
the effects we observe, in connection with the
consequences of action - with all that has to do
with our appreciation of right and wrong, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span>
and evil, and moral principle - can readily
enough be associated with the idea of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span>
will, embodying sanction or disapproval, they are
none the less to be recognized as a vast
department of natural law, which, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> dealing
with resources of a super-physical <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> beyond
the reach of experimental research, constitute
none the less a department of natural <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">law</span> as
uniform and definite as those which have to do
with the behaviour of matter.
We <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> ourselves in this world, under conditions
which enable us to recognize it as an arena of
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> evolution; but it is even more
obviously an arena of a complicated system of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">law</span>
relating to <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> matter, and in reference to
this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">law</span> we may even extend our

rule, I think it <span class="t8 t12 t17 hoverable">wise</span> to confine our attention.
In presence of attempts sometimes made to
interpret or speculate concerning the origin and
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> government of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> universe, I have
often ventured to suggest that it is unwise to do
more than endeavour to comprehend the origin and
purpose of our Solar System. At the best, in
reference to that, we can never hope to do more
than obtain fragmentary conceptions, and dimly to
picture in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> the story of its origin and
the theory of its final perfection. But in

reference to <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">law</span> we are enabled to
perceive that the code which is manifestly
operative in the Solar System is certainly, to
some extent - possibly in its entirety applicable to the innumerable systems distributed
through the infinitudes of space. It is certain,
for example, that the fundamental <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">law</span> of
gravitation, governing all masses of <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span>
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> our view, is also operative in distant
systems of a wholly different <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> where a dual
or multiple system of Suns can be distinctly
observed as obedient to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">law</span> which governs the
motion of our own planets in their orbits. And
beyond this the resources of spectroscopic
observation enable us to identify, in distant
Suns, some of the varieties under which <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span>
manifests to us in our laboratories, and to
speculate, not unreasonably, on the probability
that the so-called chemical elements with which
we are acquainted here are also the materials of
which distant Solar Systems are constructed, and
which, most probably, are obedient in such
systems to the same laws of chemical affinity
that we are enabled to investigate in handling
those elements on earth. The value of this
observation has to do, of course, with the manner
in which it tends to suggest an otherwise
unrecoginizable unity in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> cosmos, even
if it is hardly profitable for us to pursue that
idea much farther. But <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> we think of the
natural laws affecting <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> in their cosmic or
in their more limited aspect, we cannot but be
equally driven to the conclusion that the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span>

systems, impresses on the complex organisms <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span>
<span class="t16 hoverable">created</span> the characteristics they exhibit when the
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span> is accomplished.
Along the lines of ordinary astronomical
speculation, as also by the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> of esoteric
teaching, we are enabled to formulate a broad
conception of the manner in which the worlds of a
system like our own are built up by the

aggregation in the first instance of relatively
homogenous <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> available throughout space.
Astronomy deals with the development of Suns and
planets, from nebulæ; occult teaching follows
along somewhat the same path, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> going back a
little earlier in the story, and recognizing the
formation of the nebulæ as the result of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span>
Will operating on the infinite expanse of etheric
substance. But <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> we imagine that by virtue
of laws pervading the Universe, etheric <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span>
when aggregated into <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> molecules is
inherently invested with the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of endowing
those molecules with the attributes we recognize
in the chemical elements, or <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> we imagine a
Will which, by the first hypothesis, emanates
from some cosmic influence, to be reproduced by
the will of the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Power</span> to which our system
is directly due, the same conclusion emerges from
either hypothesis. The attributes of matter,
constituting in their entirety that which we
describe as the laws of Nature, are the
expression of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Will, either consciously
operating throughout the Universe directly, or
indirectly passed on through the will of the
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">Beings</span> to whom the <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> of each Solar
System is due. And apart from the general force
of reasonable speculation along these lines, I
have been incidentally assured that clairvoyant
observation of a <span class="t23 hoverable">high</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> will confirm this
conclusion in a curious and interesting way.
To render this suggestion intelligible we must
remember, of course, that wherever we <span class="t9 t11 t20 t21 t22 t23 t27 hoverable">speak</span> of
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Will operating in regions of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Nature</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span>
our own purview, we have to understand that it
operates through a vast hierarchy of subordinate
agency. Such agency has, of course, to be
recognized as associated with varieties of
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> evolution quite independent of the

of course, moving through a region of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> in
which manifestation is obscure, and observation
extremely difficult. But none the less, I have

whom I have been disposed to trust, that where
important resarches, connected with some of the

with the departments of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Nature</span> it is their duty
to preside over. If this be actually the case, it
serves to emphasize the main idea with which I am
at present concerned, the direct bearing of
conscious will on the laws of matter, which, at
cruder stages of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> thought, the science of
the period contrived to regard as compatible with
an atheistic contempt for all conceptions
relating to a <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> origin. That worship of
<span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> per se which characterized a certain
variety of scientific thought, in the last
century, is no less ludicrously discredited by
the illuminated <span class="t14 t24 hoverable">intelligence</span> represented by the
<span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">Higher</span> Occultism, than the equally crude
conception of primitive theology which, while
certainly recognizing <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Power</span> as a factor in

which we now perceive to be as little in harmony
with the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> as the grosser
materialistic belief. The notion that the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span>
Being does no more than pronounce a word, in
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> that natural phenomena shall be evoked,
fully armed, ex nihilo, is hardly less absurd,
hardly less derogatory to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of Divinity
than the opposite belief that <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> existed from
the eternity of the past, and can, by its own
combinations, give rise to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> consciousness.
Even our comprehension of the natural machinery
by means of which <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> effects are produced
may serve, for instance, to put a new complexion
on the <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> of the familiar expression, "Let
there be light." That the sensation in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span>
<span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> is an expression of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span>
Will, is emphatically one of the ideas I am eager
to emphasize, but we know that the result is

produced by the complicated mechanism of etheric
vibration, and that Divinity had a more
complicated task to perform, in providing for the
sensation of light, than <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have been evolved
in the simple utterance of a decree. The
behaviour of the ether, in conveying vibrations
from distant sources of light, to the planets
requiring illumination, is complicated to that
degree that our investigations, as yet, have but
vaguely hinted at some of its complexities; but
the illustration serves to suggest the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> in
which the results aimed at in <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span> are
obtained by what, relatively to early theological
belief, must be regarded as elaborate and
laborious methods; methods almost certainly,
associated with a stupendous hierarchy of
subordinate agencies reflecting the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Will
at every stage of the process.
But so far I have been dealing only with half the
idea I want to convey; that which is, in a
certain sense, the least important half, because
it involves ideas which, independently of occult
research, will probably be found floating in the
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> of the period, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> perhaps, in most
cases, more vaguely than when clarified by a
broad and comprehensive appreciation of the
world's evolution, as a whole. The expansion of
the idea into the region of intangible cause and
effect, is certainly not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> familiar to ordinary
psychological speculation. But, to begin with,
all of us who have been appreciative of
Theosophical teaching on the comprehensive scale,
will be familiar with the idea that what is known
as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">law</span> of Karma, is a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">law</span> operative on the
moral plane, as definitely as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">law</span> of
gravitation controls the region of <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span>
manifestation. But that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">law</span> is generally <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span>
of as a vague expression of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Will; and even
with such opportunity as may be furnished by
familiarity, in some cases, with the evolution of
specific Egos through a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> series of lives,

as working with the regularity so plainly
observable when we are dealing with the laws of
<span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> Nature, nevertheless, we do broadly
recognize the idea that conduct in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of a

consequences, following an inevitable rule, and
not subject in each <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> to specific judgements
resembling those of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> autocrat. None the
less, however, when we think of Karma, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> or
bad, as operative to produce agreeable or painful
conditions in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> or lives following any
action in question, it is difficult to get out of
the habit of thinking that the Ego concerned has
somehow been the subject of a judgement. The
<span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> laws of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Nature</span> seem so fundamentally
welded with <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> that it is only with a mental
effort we can comprehend them as in <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> the

aspects of conduct, the rightness or wrongness of
specific action, suggest instinctively the idea
that their conformity, or non-conformity, with
the intentions of God, is the explanation of
their rightness or their wrongness. In this <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span>
a mental effort is required to establish the
conception that the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> will is so

complex in its character as the laws of chemical
affinity. It is Law, enacted once for all and
applicable to all conceivable varieties of
circumstances.
The conception with which we are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> inevitably

moral nature, dealing as appropriately with the
pettiest short-comings, with the feeblest
aspirations upward, as with the grandest
achievements of philanthropy or the foulest
varieties of crime.
It must be allowed that we cannot easily escape
from old habits of thought, nor give up the trick
of thinking of any particular faculty we may
possess as a gift of Nature, of any suffering we
may be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> to endure as a chastisement

retain, in many cases, even the habit of

given to us "this day," and for which it is
decent, on our part, to return thanks, as we sit

need not be the slave of any tradition, however

speak, of steering a chosen path through the
complexities of the law. But the law, itself,
provides compensation for the embarrassments of

Nor even need we cast aside the early
anthropomorphic conception of Divinity which
appealed to the saintship of a more primitive
age, and responded to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> thirst of

sufficiently like ourselves to excite adoration
and love. We who are, at present, concerned with
the attempt to comprehend the <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> of the
<span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">Higher</span> Occultism, may be embarrassed, for a time,
by finding it impossible to retain
anthropomorphic conceptions of Divinity while, as
yet, our <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> is insufficient to picture in
imagination the Divinity which, in some
mysterious fashion, is at once, as it were, the
fountain of the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t8 t13 t15 t17 t18 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> principle and the
destination of that principle as it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> in our
own nature. To suppose that the <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">Higher</span> Occultism,
because it puts aside some of the crude fancies
of humanity's childhood, embodies a hard, cold,
or unsympathetic conception of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> rule, is to

deplorably almost than this unfortunate result

can be accomplished by any other
misunderstanding. The essence of many religious
conceptions may still be retained in our thought,
even when their ecclesiastical presentation is
put from us as out of date, and the complete
grasp of the ideas I have been endeavouring, in
the course of this essay, to suggest - thoughts
so subtle that their clear presentation is a
<span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> of extreme difficulty - will, for example,
help to emphasize, rather than to discredit, one
of the most beautiful phrases that can be
borrowed from the literature of early religion.
For our <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> will, with the help of improved
enlightenment, may enable us, in conformity with
the reign of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">law</span> on the moral plane, to vindicate

out results on the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> plane, of which we
may be definitely regarded as the authors, so the
ultimate comprehension of the loftier <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">law</span> will
enable us, if that figure of speech be
permissable, to ascend to regions of <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> in
which we shall transcend its operation,
vindicating that old familiar phrase, in my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span>

merely in the sphere of manifestation on which
our potentialities may be developed - "we live
and move and have our being."

THE <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">HIGHER</span> OCCULTISM
THE instruction given in ancient Greece to those
who <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> part in the meetings at Eleusis celebrated in history as the Eleusinian Mysteries
- related, as we have abundant <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> to believe,
to super-physical <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> concerning the <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span>
planes of Nature, of the kind that has been
freely promulgated amongst us in recent years.
Such <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> is that with which we are engaged
in our study of the <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">Higher</span> Occultism. The eager
pursuit of super-physical <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> has been a
leading characteristic of civilized <span class="t14 t24 hoverable">intelligence</span>
for the last fifty years, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span>
multitudes have come to know that communication
between this plane of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> and that to which
humanity passes after the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">death</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> is
possible. But the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> movement - having a wider
scope than that which, importance as its
influence has been, is narrowed to the
consideration of experiences immediately
following the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> - the study of the
<span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">Higher</span> Occultism with which we are now concerned,
originated with the Theosophical Society, the
branches of which spread now over the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span>
world. This <span class="t1 hoverable">Society</span> was, at all events as regards
this country, the channel through which recent
enlightenment has been poured, and this it
becomes necessary to glance back over the history
of the current movement in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> to appreciate
the importance of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> it has been priviliged
to accomplish, as also in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> to appreciate the
dignity of the task which lies before it. And to
do this effectually it is necessary to look back
even farther than to those earlier beginnings of
modern civilization when the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> that we
have been enabled to handle so freely was already
in the possession of a few, but guarded for these
few, in accordance with what was then held to be
imperative necessity, by secrecy of the most
rigid order.
At a period <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> anterior to the establishment of

the Eleusinian Mysteries, similar teaching was
undoubtedly conveyed to students of Occultism
attached to Egyptian temples, and what we know
now enables us to realize that there never has
been a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> in the history of mankind during
which the evolving race was <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> entirely <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span>

understood. In the childhood of the race, indeed,
as we are now in a position to apprehend so
clearly, such <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> was only possessed by
representatives of a more advanced evolution,
trusted, under <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Providence, with the

nurture and education of the new race of which
they were in charge. But gradually, as the more
advanced representatives of this race attained
something resembling maturity of intelligence, a
few amongst them, qualified by exceptionally
rapid advancement, were priviliged to share in
the <span class="t12 t20 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">wisdom</span> of their preceptors. In this way,

of our humanity held it to be premature to share
their <span class="t12 t20 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">wisdom</span> with the indiscrminate multitude.
The Occult student is enabled to appreciate the
considerations which induced them to maintain
this reserve. All <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> in varying degrees,

are sometimes disposed to resent. Dealing,
however, for the moment merely with the course of

hand. Earlier impressions with reference to the
teaching conferred on students of Occultism in
former ages, are generally to the effect that
such teaching must have been intensely
interesting, that it invested the possessor with
powers of a kind unfamiliar to ordinary life,
that it was something so desirable in itself that
no personal sacrifices were allowed to stand in
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> of those who aspired to it, that no

with a correct appreciation of all that its
acquisition signified. It is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> that the Adept
and, in a lesser degree, those who are advancing
along the path leading to adeptship, acquire

the dignity of which cannot easily be
exaggerated. But these rewards are not those
which the enlightened aspirant for adeptship is
seeking in his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> and laborious efforts to make
progress in that direction. That which he soon
learns to realize, if morally capable of
continuous advance along the path he has chosen,
is suggested by the simple <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> that the path

out on an enormous scale for the ultimate

such. Occult Science is so concatenated
altogether in its vast entirety, that these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>

have completely assimilated the teaching now
available for all of us who care to profit by it,
concerning the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> design in which the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span>

effectually by the literature of modern Occultism
will be in a position to appreciate the force of
what I have just said, and even those who as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span>

influence of that sympathetic feeling for it now
so widely diffused, will no doubt be able to
catch the significance of the fundamenal <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> I

ready to perceive the manner in which the study
of the conditions leading upwards towards
adeptship casts a flood of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the future

study of the teaching we have been privileged to

receive concerning the future destinies of the
race, will invest progress towards adeptship with
a dignity far greater than that assigned to it at
an earlier period of thought, by observers who
merely supposed that it was aimed at for the sake
of its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> and its power.
Reverting now to the course of events, we have to
begin by contemplating the attitude of the
advanced occultist towards the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> at large, at
a period anterior to the recent outburst of
specific teaching. Of course it was obvious to
those already on adept levels, at any period of
the past to which we may look back, that sooner
or later the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> they so jealously guarded
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have to be disseminated broadcast
throughout the world. But their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> also
enabled them to perceive that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span>
stupendous scheme of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> evolution was
susceptible of division into <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> halves. It
has been the task of modern interpreters of
Occultism to describe the characteristics of
these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> phases of evolution in
considerable detail, and we know that throughout
the first half of the process - frequently
described as the downward arc of evolution - the

animating the undertaking, into specific centers
of consciousness, these constituting, when
developed, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> Egos, qualified to accumulate

incarnations, and gradually to arrive, in that
way, at the midway station of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>
journey, with no other duty, so to speak, up to
that time, than those relating to their own
individualization, to their acquisition of
strength and capacity as separated entities each
conscious of its own interests. Looking back
indeed to earlier races of mankind anterior even
to the mighty Atlantean race immediately
preceding our own, we may realize, almost with
surprise, from our present point of view, that

the most sublime virtue we now are qualified to
admire - and some of us perhaps, in some degree,
qualified to aspire to - the virtue of
unselfishness, did not even dawn as a conception
on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> in the beginning.
On the contrary, there was a stage, during the
progress of humanity along the downward arc, when
selfishness was the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">law</span> of progress - of such
progress as was then desired in accordance with
the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> purpose. But from the midway stage of
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> evolution onwards, new conceptions of right
and wrong became possible. Of course the midway
stage was not reached by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> race
simultaneously, but a considerable <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> of

front, by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> the Atlantean race had lived

upward arc leading towards <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> perfection.
We do not know with precision how soon it became
theoretically possible for the most advanced
members of our own family to receive, from the
superior teachers who preceded them, the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> which we now handle so freely and
describe as the <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">Higher</span> Occultism; but at all
events, during the latter half of the Atlantean
race some members of our own <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> family were
enabled to appreciate the lofty design sketched
out for their advancement, to detach themselves
from the chaotic throng of their self-seeking
contemporaries, and to establish here and there,
even in that early world, centres of initiation
from which their influence began in a faint,
diluted fashion to radiate through the world, and
towards which those <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> spontaneous interior

progress had invested them with appropriate
qualifications were drawn into the paths of
<span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> knowledge. But millenniums had to
accumulate until thousands were no longer
adequate to record the progress of the years,
before the adept fraternity could contemplate the
possibility of disseminating the <span class="t12 t20 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">wisdom</span> they
possessed broadcast through the world. Some
elevated moral principles, as the progress of
mankind along the upward arc proceeded, were of a
kind which it was possible to convey with safety
to the multitude, and that possibility found its
expression in the fondation of all the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>
religions of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> which have emanated, as we
see now <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> the possibility of mistake, from
the <span class="t12 t20 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">wisdom</span> of early adeptship. That suggesion
need not be held at variance with the belief
which assigns a <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> origin to some religions
of the kind referred to. <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> purposes are
worked out in all cases through subordinate
agencies, and the comprehension of this, in many
ways, is one of the illuminating discoveries that
we are enabled to reach through the study of
Occultism. But at all events, those who
appreciate the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> and educational
blessings conferred on humanity by religion, may
readily erect on that primary belief the further
conception that at a certain stage of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span>
progress specific <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> science
may, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> offending against the dignity of
religion, be super-added to it. And what we know
now is that for some centuries, adept observers
of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> growth in this fifth race of ours - the
first beyond the Atlantean on the upward arc of
evolution - have been on the watch for
indications which may show that an adequate
<span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> of those <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> hitherto to the simpler
influence and guidance of religious thought,
might become qualified for the reception in its
entirety, or at all events, in considerable
measure, of that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> science from which
religion, in the first instance, had its rise.

We can see now, looking back 100, 200, or even
300 years, that some experiments were made by the
adept experts of this science, to ascertain
<span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> amongst ordinary humanity <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> were
ripe for <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> teaching in a sufficient degree
to justify its public dissemination. To trace the
details of these experiments <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be a
considerable task by itself, which indeed some of
us have attempted to carry out by studying the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> histories of distinguished occultists
throughout the Middle Ages. But passing over
that, for the moment, we have to recognize that
until our own <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> such experiments were held to
be unsuccessful, and so we come at last - along
the train of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> I have been following - to
an intelligent comprehension of the circumstances
that prompted the recent outburst of teaching
from adept sources. That teaching embodied in the
earliest Theosophical books was itself
experimental in its inception, but unlike
previous attempts of a similar character, was
crowned with success. Sufficient numbers of
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> in the modern <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> - or leaving out of
<span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> whatever has been done in the East, I may
fairly say in this modern European <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> of ours
- have shown themselves entitled, by the
readiness of their appreciation, to receive
occult teaching in such abundant volume, that we
stand now in a position, in that respect, of
intellectual advancement, far exceeding the
corresponding position reached by those who, as a
privilige individually earned and guarded by vows
of secrecy, were taught something of the <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">Higher</span>
Occultism when the Mysteries were celebrated at
Eleusis.

THE OBJECTS OF THE THEOSOPHICAL
<span class="t1 hoverable">SOCIETY</span>
1. - THEOSOPHICAL "BROTHERHOOD"

FROM <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> we may usefully review the
gradually improving conceptions we have been
enabled to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> concerning the grand purposes
underlying the Theosophical Movement. The phrases
in which these were ultimately crystallized do
not (though this matters little) reflect the
ideas present to the minds of those who, in 1875,
did actually, in a certain sense, "found" the
Society. At that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> it was the result of
interest excited among a small group of persons
frequenting Madame Blavatsky's rooms in New York,
by the exhibition of her wonderful Occult powers.
As Colonel Olcott explains in his Diary Leaves a
lecture was given in September, 1875, at Madame
Blavatsky's rooms by a certain Mr. Felt, of whom
we lose sight afterwards, on the Adept Magic of
Egyptian priests. Colonel Olcott then suggested
the formation of a <span class="t1 hoverable">Society</span> to study this subject.
That was done, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> the title
"Theosophical" was adopted (doubtless under
occult guidance), Colonel Olcott at one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span>
proposed to <span class="t3 t11 t18 t27 hoverable">call</span> it a "Miracle Club."
The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> "Brotherhood" does not creep into its
records till some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> later. It was first <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span>
by Mr.C.C.Massey and his friends in London when
they formed a British branch of the New York
Society. They described its purpose as being "to
discover the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> and powers of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span>
soul," and they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> on to declare that they
believed in "a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> intelligent First Cause and
in the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> sonship of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> of Man, and
hence in the immortality of that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> and in
the universal Brotherhood of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> race."
Colonel Olcott <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> this hint and developed the
idea in a new statement of subjects as follows:
"(1) The study of Occult Science; (2) the

formation of a nucleus of universal brotherhood;
(3) the revival of Oriental literature." The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span>
"brotherhood" was afterwards shifted into the
first place, but it was always accompanied by the
qualifying term "Nucleus." It was not used, and
should never be used, by Theosophists with the
significance attached to it by those concerned
with mundane politics or social reconstruction on
the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> plane. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> in its theosophical
<span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> refers to the Unity of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span>
<span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> on lofty planes of Nature, and to
the nucleus for the reflection of that Unity on
the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> plane that may be formed by
theosophical students who appreciate the teaching
aright.
The gross democratic <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> attached to the term
"brotherhood" is an insult to theosophical
teaching. The <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> which expands into
perfected humanity is, no doubt, in a subtle
metaphysical <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> identical in its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> with
the <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> not merely of the humbler
classes in civilized countries, but with that
also of the crocodile, the dog, the Australian
savage, and the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> of Wisdom. But this does
not mean that all manifested <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> in
whatever vehicle we <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> it is, therefore,
invested with equal claims on our respect. It is
invested with equal claims on our sympathy, and
that is how <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> who do not appreciate subtle
distinctions drift into the misuse of the term
"brotherhood." If the sheep and the guinea-pig
are included in the universal brotherhood, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span>
and good, but we do not ask the sheep and the
guinea-pig to contribute their opinions to
discussion of the suffrage question, for example.
And that <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> is a clue to the fallacy
involved in regarding theosophical brotherhood as
leading to political socialism. Theosophical
teaching concerning <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> evolution shows us the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> family at present at very different stages
of development. It rescues us from the oldfashioned blunder - arising from the ignorant

delusion that each new child is a new <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span> to the effect that all have equal rights.
According to a phrase classical in political
writing, all are equally entitled to "life,
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness," but with
very varied claims on the privilege of shaping
laws providing for the fufilment of that
fundamental idea.
Thus, to let the formula in which the objects of
the Theosophical <span class="t1 hoverable">Society</span> are generally expressed
distort the purpose of the movement to suit the
purpose of any mundane theory of social reform is
a very grevious blunder. From the beginning all
qualified exponents of the Theosophical Movement
have warned us to keep clear of all political
contamination. The <span class="t1 hoverable">Society</span> may include persons of
very varied political opinions, but <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the
<span class="t1 hoverable">Society</span> their only duty is to study and promote
the study of the super-physical <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> science
gradually unfolded for our benefit and through us
for the benefit of all mankind. The fulfilment of
that duty should be compatible with perfect
harmony of feeling <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the Society, where it
is needless and undesirable to discuss varied
beliefs as to how the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> welfare of the
community may be best promoted. We should not
furnish unsympathetic critics of our real <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span>
with an excuse for pretending to regard us as a
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> entangled with questionable
schemes for subversive changes on the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span>
plane.
2. - THE STUDY OF COMPARATIVE RELIGIONS
By those who concern themselves with it, this
<span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> "object" is liable to be misunderstood. By
a larger <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> it is disregarded. It has a very
definite purpose really. Briefly stated, that is,
to <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> out by such study the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that at the
basis of all religions worth talking of there are
certain fundamental ideas, more or less vaguely

hinted at, which are clearly <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> forth in
Theosophical teaching. Theosophical writers have
sometimes too emphatically emphasized the idea
that Theosophy is not a religion. Of course it is
not, in the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> that it has no hard and fast
creed of the kind that most religions adopt. But
no one who really understands Theosophical
teaching is in need of any other religion. A real
comprehension of the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Hierarchy, and of the

its best can cover (besides covering a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> deal

Theosophist repudiate any religion with which by
race or nationality he may be traditionally
connected. Here we have a very pretty subtlety to
consider. If any Theosophist identified race,
residence, and habits of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> with this
country is asked the question, "Are you a
Christian?" what should he answer? To say "No"
(because in his inner <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> he felt that
occult <span class="t12 t20 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">wisdom</span> superseded all religions having a
definite name) <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be misleading and in bad
taste. My answer in such a <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be,
"Certainly; of course I am." I might go on to
explain that I had no sympathy with the
caricature of Christianity provided for us by
most of the European Churches, but that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span>
only be possible if the conversation were
protracted.
The idea to enforce is, that any one who takes up
any particular religion and makes a close study
of that, embellishing its crudities as far as he
can by the results of his own thinking, is not
doing anything which resembles the fulfilment of
the <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of the Society. On the
contrary, he is pressing against it. The more he
succeeds in recommending to respect and attention
any particular religion in preference to others,
the more he is tending to defeat the <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span>
<span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of the Society, the grand underlying
purpose of which - veiled rather than fully

expressed by the formal enumeration of objects is to convey to the large numbers of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> now
fit to receive it, the magnificent volume of

the exclusive possession of the Elder Brethen of
humanity.
This could not have been done at a much earlier
period. Clumsy religions, brutal bigotry, atheism
(the result of disgust developed among the most
intelligent by the stupidity of priests and
clergy), all stood in the way. But the experiment
was made in these latter years, and has been
justified by partial success. Multitudes all over
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> do appreciate the gift of occult
knowledge. Of course, besides these, many rush in
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> understanding the real purpose of the
movement, caught by some phrase associated with
it, into which they read their own
prepossessions. They may impede the progress of
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> for a time, but there are forces
behind this that must prevail in the end. Far
beyond the limits of the <span class="t1 hoverable">Society</span> the fascination
of occult teaching is spreading through the
cultured classes. To that growth we must look
forward with confident hope, even if we, or some
of us, get a little out of patience with mistaken
ideas permeating the <span class="t1 hoverable">Society</span> at this early stage
of its existence. The Theosophical Movement is
much bigger than the Theosophical Society, which
must undergo <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> purification if it is, in
future years, destined to lead the Theosophical
Movement. The movement itself is pressing towards
a period when advanced thinkers will not be
comparing medieval religions, but will be
comparing whichever of these appeals best to
their sympathies, with the grand <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> truths
conveyed to them by the theosophical revelation recasting their favourite religion, if they cling
to it at all, in harmony with these truths. At
the end there will be many who <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> in the
teaching which we still <span class="t3 t11 t18 t27 hoverable">call</span> "occult" all the
religion they need. Others will prefer to

decorate it with some of the phraseology of their
earlier faith. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> ceremonial religions will
survive by their various names, and in the midst
of all there will be a central block of thinkers,
more or less indifferent to ceremonial, who will
be content to <span class="t3 t11 t18 t27 hoverable">call</span> themselves "Theosophists,"
pure and simple. But the same ideas will permeate
all groups, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> progress will then have
been made in the development of that
"brotherhood" the "nucleus" of which we, who
understand our task, are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> to "form" at
this commencement of the stupendous religious
construction, the beautiful results of which
those adequately gifted with foresight can

3. - THE POWERS LATENT IN <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">MAN</span>
The <span class="t7 hoverable">third</span> <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of the <span class="t1 hoverable">Society</span> is less liable to
be misunderstood than either the first or second,
but is perhaps the most important, and, like any
other idea expressed in concise language, is open
to various interpretations. It is formally stated
in these terms: "To investigate the unexplained
laws of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Nature</span> and the powers latent in Man."
These <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> properly understood may be held to
inaugurate the study of an entirely new science.
The mistake sometimes made is to suppose that
they merely prescribe an attempt to cultivate
hitherto undeveloped faculties theoretically
latent in each of us. That, in most cases, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span>
prove an extremely unsatisfying or disappointing
pursuit. Most <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> of this age and race have
come into the present <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> the
potentiality of such development in themselves.
As with every other attribute we possess the
potentiality of psychic perception can only exist
as the product of some effort made in a former
life. Many theosophists accept en bloc the theory
of Karma, and at once proceed to ignore it when
they think of themselves. They are too often
encouraged to do this by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> endowed with

psychic faculties who <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> these so natural and
easily <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> that they cannot help thinking that
anyone might acquire them by working for that end
with sufficient earnestness of purpose. Volumes
(reckoning such writing in the aggregate) have
ben <span class="t0 t11 t24 hoverable">written</span> to assure candidates for psychic
development that if they will only "lead the
life" - be ascetics in the <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> of food, drink,
etc., etc. - they will be able to verify
Theosophical teaching for themselves. One might
just as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> tell a weak, undersized boy that by
eating underdone beefsteaks and using the
dumbbells he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> make himself able to go into
the ring and beat a prize-fighter. The boy's
Karma has not endowed him with an athletic body,
and he must be content to <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> it for pursuits it
is adapted to deal with.
Of course it is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> that there are cases in
which partially endowed persons may greatly
stimulate their latent faculties. It is only a
question of their Karmic condition. There are all
degrees of this condition to consider. At one end
of the scale we have <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> who are naturally
psychic from childhood onwards, and who, if they
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> pains, develop into <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> clairvoyants and
seers in mature life. At the other end of the
scale we have those who, however gifted
intellectually, morally, and physically, have no
glimmering of psychic faculty and could not
develop that even if they made the struggle to do
so the passion of a lifetime and ruined their
health by asceticism. Between these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> extremes
there are all varieties of condition, and in some
of these appropriate effort may give rise to
results. I will only add, as a personal
conviction, that in no cases will the results
ensue from fanatical rules about eating and
drinking. The finest clairvoyants and psychics I
have known - and I have been priviliged to know a

rules and <span class="t28 hoverable">eat</span> whatever they <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> by experience
keeps them in the best health. I am assured on

high authority that that is the only sound rule
to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> with. Our bodies are the instruments we
have to make <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> of in this life, and whatever

makes pleasure the test of what is best for him
to <span class="t28 hoverable">eat</span> or drink.
But if it is useless for most <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> even to
think of cultivating "latent" faculties in
themselves, how does the <span class="t7 hoverable">third</span> <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> affect
them? In an extremely important way! The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> at

all led to say to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> thinking of joining the
Society: "It does not <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> you believe
in the Adept Brotherhood or not." And it did not
<span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> then. We felt that membership in the
<span class="t1 hoverable">Society</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> surely lead them sooner or later to
acquire this essential belief. If it does not,
they might really employ their energies elsewhere
to better advantage. Do my readers realize, I
wonder, how it came to <span class="t6 t9 t13 t15 t17 t18 t23 t28 t29 hoverable">pass</span> that "Esoteric
Buddhism" sent a thrill through the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> on its
first appearance? That was not merely or chiefly
because the sketch it gave of occult science met
an intellectual need, but because it made <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span>
think of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Great</span> Adepts, and that gave them a
chance of driving home a return current of
thought. They cannot begin such intercourse. The
first appeal must come from the aspiring <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span>
Ego. But once that aspiration is kindled, any
results may ensue.
Now, of course, those who profit by later
theosophical literature may learn much more about
the Masters than they could gather from the first
book. That, like every other theosophical <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">book</span> I
have ever looked at, is replete with
imperfection, for we who endeavour to interpret
the rudiments of occult science are working on
the threshold of infinity.
But there is much known now that was quite
unknown to the early leaders of the movement,
about the White Lodge and the methods of approach
to it, and those are the subjects and ideas
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> should concern themselves with if they

THE BORDERLAND OF SCIENCE
ASTRONOMY, OVERT AND OCCULT
1. - NEBULÆ

AN intelligent survey of our present <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span>
and theories concerning nebulæ seems to have been
given lately to an American astronomical <span class="t1 hoverable">society</span>
by a Mr. Vincent Francis, and I <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> it reprinted
in Popular Astronomy. The paper is illustrated by
a fine photograph of the spiral nebula in Coma
Berenices, which happens to show very clearly a
condition of nebular growth that I have insisted
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> before now, and which is entirely supported
by the writer I am quoting. You can see in the
photograph how the central <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> is condensing
first before the spirals break up into planets.
The contrary <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> was the defect of the grand
original Laplace discovery. Laplace conceived the
nebula to condense gradually from the outside;
rings being formed, the outermost first, the
central <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> being <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> to the last. By degrees it
was perceived that this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be a very unnature-like process. It was putting the cart
before the horse, or the child before the parent.
Mr. Francis more properly talks of "the parent
sun" in discussing nebular growth.
This <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> department of astronomy has only been
evolved since the development of the telescope.
One may almost say, since the Huggins discovery
that some nebulæ give a purely gaseous spectrum,
making it certain that they were not star
clusters. Since then we have got on rapidly. It
was found, indeed, that some nebulæ, certainly
not resolvable into clusters, gave continuous
spectra. Some consisted of glowing gas and some
of solid particles. Then it became apparent that
most probably all nebulæ were spiral in their
shape, and we approached the conception that

central suns were formed before the planets. Then
(again with the help of Sir William Huggins) we
got at a means of ascertaining the motion of
nebulæ in the line of sight. It is an old story
now, but fascinating as ever. The dark lines in
the spectra of stars are sometimes displaced a
little as compared with those of similar bodies
in the laboratory. If they are displaced towards
the red end of the spectrum, that means that the
star is receding from us. If they are displaced
towards the violet end, that means that the star
is approaching us. The <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> waves are, in fact,
in the one <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> crushed together, in the other
drawn out. Recent <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> with this method at the
Lowell observatory has shown that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>
Andromeda nebula is approaching us at the rate of
300 kilometres per second, and other nebulæ show
still <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> velocities. But they are so far off,
hopelessly beyond the reach of parallax, almost
too far for guesswork, that some astronomers
incline to think them outside our Universe
altogether, an unacceptable guess in my humble
judgement. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> nebula in Orion is, of
course, the biggest. It covers a region of space
not less than one which <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> only cross in
forty years. But we cannot suggest a maximum
limit of its magnitude, because we have no notion
how far off it is. When we <span class="t3 t11 t18 t27 hoverable">call</span> it the nebula in
Orion, we merely mean that we can see it if we
look in the direction of Orion. How far it may be
behind the stars of that group is wholly
uncertain.
How do we see it? Is it self-luminous? There is
<span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> to assume that the <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> of which it
consists is rarer than the rarest vacuum we can
create here by instrumental means. How can such
attenuated <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> emit light? That is one of the
puzzles we have still to deal with in connection
with this subject. But meanwhile it seems pretty
clear that there are some nebulæ that do not
shine, dark nebulæ that play some mysterious part
in the vast economy of Nature. The nebulous

matter that almost surrounds the Pleiades is
assumed to be dark in the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> of not being
self-luminous, because its spectrum is identical
with that of the stars to which it belongs,
indicating that it shines with reflected light.
Then the behaviour of Nova Persei, the star which
suddenly blazed out in the constellation Perseus
in 1901, suggested the <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> in that
connection of a vast dark nebula. It lighted up a
region of the sky, the magnitude of which forbade
the idea that there had been any transmission of
<span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> across that space. The phenomenon could
only be due to the velocity of light.
The paper before me makes favourable mention of
the "planetesmal" theory, that has been much
discussed of late in scientific reviews,
bracketing it with the theory that nebulæ that
show planetesmal knots or nuclei have originated
from the collision of worn-out suns. Possibly!
There is <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> to suppose that such collisions
are among Nature's methods in starting a new
nebulae, but it is just as easy to assign
planetesmal knots to the aggregation of <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span>
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the spirals of a nebula after it has been
started in business by some other device - the
condensation of etheric <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> from infinite
space, for example.
One more <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> while on this subject concerning a
theory that some astronmers have favoured to the
effect that nebulæ, in some cases at all events,
may be so remote that they constitute Universes
outside our own altogether. "Our" Universe, on
that hypothesis, is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> stellar system
embraced by the Milky Way, and shaped, in the
aggregate, like a millstone, the diameter greatly
exceeding its thickness. Nebulæ are more frequent
in the direction of the thickness than in that of
the diameter, and from that condition of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span>
the hypothesis referred to has arisen. It has
always seemed to me to rest on quite insufficient
data, and I am glad to see that an American

astronomer, Professor Barnard, dismisses it with
confidence in its mistaken character. "We <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> to
think," he says, "of these nebulæ as being at
such vast distances from us, much beyond the
limits of our universe of stars. Photography has
shown in many ways that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> their distances
must be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> indeed they are often <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> this
<span class="t6 hoverable">side</span> of more distant stars, and that many of
them, perhaps most of them, are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> our
stellar system, and are no farther away than some
of the brighter stars."
In connection with the services photography has
rendered to astronomical science, Professor
Barnard mentions one that is new to me, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span>
doubtless familiar to experts in that line.
Comets, but faintly perceptible by the telescope
and showing no tails to the observer, are seen to
have tails by the photographic plate. And such
tails will sometimes be seen to drift away from
the comet altogether, the plate following them
for some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">days</span> till they dissipate in space. That
fits in beautifully with the theory that comets'
tails consist of minute particles driven off by
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> pressure from the Sun, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> we have to

The American magazine Popular Astronomy is a very
serious publication, claiming respectful
attention, so I have been much interested in a
statement I <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> in the last number, concerning
the well-known and beautiful globular cluster in
Hercules. This is one of the most wonderful
objects in the heavens when seen through a fine
telescope. It consists of thousands of suns
aggregated <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> in dense mass, so that the
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> of all those situated towards the middle is

blended in one mighty glow, only those towards
the periphery of the stupendous assemblage being
discernible as separate points of light. Now it
appears that one astronomer, Mr. Harlow Shapley,
of the Mount Wilson Solar Observatory, has
arrived at the conclusion - by what process of
reasoning we are not told - that the cluster is
distant from us to an extent that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> make its
parallax (if it had one) 0".0001. Its distance
from us, therefore, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be 100,000 <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> years,
and its diameter 1,000 <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> years. According to
this calculation, says Popular Astronomy, "the
cluster is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> another sidereal universe
external to our own." Of course some astronomers
have always been inclined to think that some of
the nebulæ are in this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> other universes - a
<span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> I have always been disinclined to adopt. Mr.
Pickering, I see, who contributes to the magazine
just quoted an article on "the sixty finest
objects in the sky," merely mentions the cluster
in Hercules as a very fine object, and does not
discuss Mr. Shapley's calculation. But he treats
the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that most of the clusters lie <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> 5
to 30 degrees of the Galactic equator as adverse
to the theory that they are objects lying beyond
the Galaxy, "although such may nevertheless be
the case."
Now the line of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> that seems to me more
definitely adverse to the theory has to do with
infinitudes of various unthinkable orders, <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span>
in conjunction with ideas suggested by the
visible facts of our own Universe. By that last
phrase I mean all the millions of visible stars
embraced by the Milky Way. The actual diameter of
the space included by that wonderful girdle is a
<span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> of conjecture, but roughly the Milky <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Way</span>

that we are somewhere near the centre of the

any map showing the distribution of Solar Systems
in the Universe, but the old Hermetic
philosophers had a favourite saying, "As below,

facts of Nature, and if we start with the
assumption that in the infinites of space there
may or must be other universes, the probability

the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Sun</span> is many times as distant as the Sun's
diameter. The nearest external universe to us
ought on the same principle to be many times the
distance of our Universe's diameter, and that, as
I have said above, is guessed at about 100,000
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> years, so the nearest external universe
ought to be much more than that distance away. It
sounds ridiculous to talk of 100,000 <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span>
as an incredible measurement by <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> of being
too little, but in talking about universes we
must think in terms of infinitude.
All this, I grant, is in the region of the most
unpractical thinking in which we can indulge, but
that is one of the fascinating attributes of
astronomy - it takes us outside the area of lowdown practicalities.
3. - PLANETS, STARS AND ATOMS
Like other sciences astronomy was paralyzed by
the war, and very little new <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> was
accomplished during its progress. But some
observations were directed to the question
<span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> the satellites of Jupiter revolve on
their axes or keep only one face to their august
primary. To be more rigidly accurate: do they
rotate on their axes only once in the period of a
revolution round the primary, or more often? The
question is <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span> of interest, because it is
always cropping up in reference to the interior

planets, Venus and Mercury, and has a very
important bearing on all speculation as to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span>
in other worlds. The one celestial <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> that
undoubtedly turns only one face to its primary is
our own moon; but by common consent the moon is
to be regarded as a dead planet, <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> we
accept (what seems to be) the foolish theory that
it is a fragment of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> torn off at an
early stage of our planetary life, or the other
theory that it is really the remains of an older
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> than ours, the outer casings of which were
melted off when the nebular condensation that
gave rise to our <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> was in progress. Now we
cannot frame any corresponding hypothesis that
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> for the satellites of Jupiter. Let
me remind the reader of what we know about them.
Leaving out of <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> the later discovered
exterior satellites outside the familiar four and these may be merely masses of meteoric <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span>
caught by the attraction of Jupiter - the wellknown four are bodies of considerable magnitude.
The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> innermost, Io and Europa, to give them
the names that have been assigned to them, are
somewhat smaller than our moon, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> outer
ones, Ganymede and Callisto, are somewhat larger.
These have been the subject of study by Mr.
Waterfield of the British Astronomical
Association, and he thinks he has discerned
markings which show that Callisto always turns
the same face to Jupiter, while Ganymede, the
outermost of the four, does not seem quite to do
this, but has a period of rotation fifty-nine
minutes less than the period of its revolution
round the primary. It seems presumptuous to
criticize the conclusions of an astronomer using
powerful instruments, but this theory about tidal
action - the assumed cause of the single rotation
idea - is so much in fashion just now that one
can <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> believe observers falling in with it,
prone to discover evidence in its favour. My main
objection to it turns on very broad principles
which seem to underlie all reasonable theories of

the Universe. So far as observation enables us to
check the conception, the purpose of
manifestation on the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> plane is to provide
for the activities of life. All intelligent
thinkers have <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> since got beyond the primitive
notion that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Earth</span> is the only inhabited
world; that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Sun</span> and stars exist merely for
our sake. We need not jump to the conception that
all other worlds are inhabited by <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> just
like ourselves, but the more closely we study the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Earth</span> the more we <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> it teeming with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of
one kind or another in every corner, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> in
forms adapted to the most varied conditions of
heat and cold. Directly <span class="t4 t7 t12 t16 hoverable">faith</span> lifts us above
blank materialism it becomes impossible to rest
content with the idea that any of the other
planets of the Solar System are mere purposeless
masses of dead matter. They must be theatres of
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of one kind or another.
Now the theory about turning one face to the
primary has even been applied to the interior
planets of our system. Venus and Mercury are
supposed by some astronomers to turn only one
face to the Sun. But this arrangement <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> make
them to be unfit to be the theatres of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of
any kind. One part <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be burnt to a cinder,
and the other frozen to an unimaginable degree.
The theory as applied to Venus and Mercury is an
insult to the harmonies of Nature, and if
observers think they have detected markings the
motions of which seem to imply the single
rotation arrangement - I do not say tant pis pour
les faits, but tant pis pour the current
interpretation of the facts. As regards the
satellites of Jupiter it is true, even <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span>
they should really turn one face to the primary,
they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> in their revolution round him turn all
faces in succession to the Sun, so such <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> and
warmth as they get from him <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be evenly
diffused. On the other hand, as against Mr.
Waterfield's contention, we have to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> first
the all but universality of the habit celestial

bodies have of turning on their axes. Secondly,
the Jupiter satellites, whatever their origin may
have been, are certainly not what our satellite
is, remains of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> older than the primary.
They are four independent bodies of considerable
magnitude, and we must await the development of
our <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> to a far <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> level than we have

beginnings. "We are ancients of the Earth," etc.,
and the expansion of our faculties since the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">days</span>

unthinkable for the earlier ancients of that
time. Another advance of corresponding importance
may enable us, or our successors, to cross in
<span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> the spaces of the Solar System.
In another direction of astronomical research
some American attention has been turned to Star
Clusters, with results rather too speculative to
command unqualified trust. Working with
calculations based <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> apparent magnitudes and
probable (!) real luminosities, one observer of
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> cluster in Hercules assigns to it a
parallax that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> give the distance across the
cluster as 1,000 <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> years. The calculation is
<span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> to fortify the conjecture that such clusters
are distant universes lying in space apart from
our Universe, bounded by the Milky Way. Except as
giving us enormous magnitudes to think about,
speculation of this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> hardly seems
interesting.

META-SCIENCE
We recognize "metaphysics" as a formless realm in
which the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> may wander and be <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> of the
tiresome regulations that impede thinking when we
are concerned with Science. But as the
<span class="t14 t24 hoverable">intelligence</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> expands, may there come
into recognition, by degrees, a variety of
thinking that shall be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> "meta-science,"

extending beyond the realm of matter? An article
on "Fatalism and Destiny" in the Times Literary
Supplement, just published as I begin to write,
suggests this question. The author of the article
reaches no definite conclusions, and is mainly
concerned with putting aside, in an attitude of
lordly superiority, what he assumes to be a
tendency among soldiers engaged in the war to
adopt the theory of fatalism. Such theories "are
strange, because they seem like the intrusion of
a forgotten <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> in the rational <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> of
our beliefs." The soldier in the midst of
exploding shells is graciously pardoned for
taking refuge in fatalism, and the author
wanders, for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> columns, around the subject,
somehow finding comfort in a distinction between
fatalism and "destiny," the value of which may
not be very clear to the reader.
Now it is quite <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> that the war has made the

much more insistent in their demand on attention
than they <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> to be in the ancient <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">days</span> of
peace. And the wave of interest in super-physical
research and speculation that is spreading
through the intellectual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> has a force that

enquiry they <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> that belief in the possibility
of getting definite news from those who have
"passed on" is not confined, as they had been
told, to weak-minded women and fraudulent
fortune-tellers, but is held as a solid
conviction by a large <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> of the most eminent

Such books as Sir A. Conan Doyle's New
Revelation, Sir William Barrett's Threshold of
the Unseen, and Sir Oliver Lodge's Raymond, and
scores of earlier volumes of equal value and
dignified authorship, make the old-fashioned
attitude of supercilious contempt for
Spiritualism too ridiculous to be kept up much

meta-science will show the, looker-on that even

ATOMS AND ETHER
I have referred from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> to the theory
that the electron is an atom of electricity
supported (in the beginning at all events) by Sir
J.J. Thomson and Sir Oliver Lodge. I have
ventured to repudiate that theory in favour of
its rival - the theory that the electron is an
atom of ether carrying a definite charge of
electricity. Of course, I am very far from being

alone in dissenting from the views of the
dignified authorities just mentioned, but the
atomic theory of electricity must be regarded so
far as the more orthodox <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of the two, and a
recent <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Nature</span> actually heads an article
with the words: "The Atom of Electricity." Now,
of course, one difficulty in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> of general
acceptance for the etheric theory of the electron
arises from the <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> that has been widely
entertained concerning the constitution of the
ether itself. According to that conception the
attributes of the ether embody a mass of paradox.
It has been described as non-molecular, denser
than the densest metals and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> utterly
intangible to our senses, perfectly frictionless,
interpenetrating all matter, which is at the same
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> passing through it with planetary velocity.
Then this mysterious medium, at once denser than
the densest solid, and less so than the finest
gases, is undulating all the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> at rates which
paralyze imagination, and giving rise to all the
sensations of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> and colour.
But are we capable of framing any theory that
will fit the facts better than the ultra-dense
non-molecular theory? The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Russian chemist,
Mendeléeff, answered that question some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> ago
in a <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">book</span> that attracted at the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> less
attention than it deserved, while now, in the
midst of the electron controversy, it really
clamours for attention. It is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> A Chemical
Conception of the Ether. I will endeavour to
explain the argument, content to say, first, that
there can be no one in the scientific hierarchy
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> enough to treat any views of Mendeléeff's
with disdain. He was the originator of the
universally accepted periodic table of the
elements, an arrangement which groups them in
octaves in a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> somewhat resembling the grouping
of musical sounds. The elements in each recurring
octave show attributes corresponding to those of
the previous octave. The discovery of this
relationship has given rise to many other

discoveries, for there were gaps in the periodic
table as first drawn up on the basis of such
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> as was then at our disposal. These gaps
pointed to the probability that there ought to be
elements that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> fit them, and with that clue,
one by one most of these have been discovered.
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">Within</span> recent years, however, the discovery of
the inert gases of the atmosphere - argon,
helium, krypton and the rest - presented chemists
with a new puzzle. There was no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> for them in
the periodic table. Mendeléeff, in the <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">book</span> I
have named above, finds the difficulty merely the
introduction to a new and brilliant hypothesis.
All these inert gases <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> a new group or column
by themselves, and their atomic weights fit in
with this arrangement. But there are gaps in the
new column! To make the arrangement symmetrical
there should be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> bodies lighter than helium.
And this condition of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> harmonizes with a
belief Mendeléeff tells us he has <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span>
entertained that there ought to be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span>
"elements," as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> unknown to science, lighter
than hydrogen. He boldly fills up these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> gaps
with bodies x and y, and x, the lighter of the
two, he suggests, is the Ether!
This presentation of the idea by such an
illustrious representative of orthodox chemistry
as Mendeléeff will be of fascinating interest to
a group of thinkers on subjects of this kind,
towards whom, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> they may seem as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> in the
vanguard of wild speculation, my sympathies are
inclined to lean. According to that <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> the
ether is the ultimate <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> matter,
from which all the familiar varieties of <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span>
are derived. This <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> establishes the ether
really as the "protyle" of Crookes' famous
hypothesis as to "the Genesis of the Elements."
It seems to me that with Mendeléeff's help we are
bringing a lot of previously scattered
conceptions to a common focus. Arguing from the
analogies of the other columns, Mendeléeff

assigns to x, or the ether, an atomic weight (a
maximum value) of 0.17. Probably, he says, the
weight is far less, as analogy suggests that its
molecule contains only one atom. To interpret the
argument <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> involve the <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> of mathematical
formulae that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be out of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> here, but it
helps to explain the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that the ether pervades
all space, disregarding the attraction of
planets. The velocity of its atomic vibrations
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> enable it to overcome gravitation. And the
dimensions of the etheric atoms <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be of such

material basis for the unit charge of electricity

to me the monstrous absurdity of treating force
as atomic. One might as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> talk of an atom of

still commands general acquiescence. I rejoice,
therefore, to observe in America the dawn of a
clear understanding as to the real <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> in

and others still persist in regarding it as an
atom of electricity. A <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> and, as it seems to
me, an extremely intelligent article appears in
The Scientific American, under the heading, "The
Relations of <span class="t25 hoverable">Matter</span> and Ether." That all atoms of
<span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> matter, even the finest, those of
hydrogen, are built up each of many electrons, is
a practically established fact, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> opinions
still differ widely as to the <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> of electrons
in each. Anyhow, these are supposed, quite

correctly in all probability, to move about
freely <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the space included by the atom,
just as the planets of a solar system move about
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the space embraced by each solar system.
The article before me recognizes the electron as
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> the unit of <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> matter, while agreeing
that it is also - or represents also - the unit
volume of electric force. It has a dual aspect. I
must here quote a few lines from the article to
show how the writer glides into the <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> I have
always maintained. "A question of moment here
arises. Can the corpuscles of the ether, its unit
particle, be smaller than this vastly minute
particle of matter? Are we not warranted in
suggesting that these may be in the same category
as far as size is concerned? <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> if this is
admitted as probable we cannot stop here. If
these excessively minute particles, the electron
and the ether corpuscles, are similar in size,
may they not be similar in other directions? In
short, may they not be identical?"
On the basis of this more than reasonable
hypothesis, the writer goes on to draw various
inferences. We start with the conception of the
ether as atomic in its constitution and filling
all space - the raw material from which all
<span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> is built up. May it not be
susceptible of <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> in different states as
<span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> exists in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> states,
solid, liquid, and gaseous? Then the atomic
condition in which it fills all space and
transmits the vibrations of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> and heat <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span>
be its gaseous condition. In its liquid condition
it might roll up into drops analogous to those of
water, and become atoms of <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> matter! I do
not <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> that idea at all helpful. A much simpler
and more natural <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> treats the aggregation of
etheric atoms into <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> molecules as a
process accomplished by stages. Atomic ether does
not appeal to our <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> senses. Evidently
there must be some minimum <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> of etheric
atoms in a molecule to render it so qualified.

Aggregations of lesser <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> still remain
imperceptible to our senses. But it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be
extravagant to assume that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Nature</span> has no
activities outside those limits. The minor
aggregations of etheric atoms that do not come
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the range of our senses must constitute so
many varieties of molecular ether!
I have <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> been convinced that there are such
varieties of molecular ether, and when this comes
to be recognized it will open the door to a flood
of new speculation concerning the phenomena of
light, heat and colour. More than this, it will
put a new and greatly more nature-like complexion
on theories concerning the radiations from the
Sun. We are all familiar with the calculation
showing that the heat radiations of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Sun</span> are
wasted to the extent of some ridiculous
percentage, because so little of them can
actually impinge <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the planets. Suppose no
heat is really wasted! - that what we <span class="t3 t11 t18 t27 hoverable">call</span> heat
is an effect developed by the molecular ether
surrounding each planet; that the vibrations of
the atomic ether of interstellar space are not
heat at all! I am not daring to assert this.
Future discovery may follow some quite different
line, but the discovery of molecular ether - at
present merely a profoundly plausible hypothesis
- arising from the discovery of the electron,
seems to me sure of accomplishment now science is
getting out of khaki after the war.
Certainly we shall have to improve our present
senses, or get some more, before we can expect to
be directly cognizant of molecular ether, but we
already deal with many natural phenomena beyond
the range of the senses. Invisible <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> and
inaudible sound are favourite subjects for
scientific letures. The ultra-violet rays can be
detected by the photographic plate; the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">note</span> of a
whistle, too shrill to be heard, can be observed
by the sensitive flame. Over and above the debt
that optics in the future may owe to the

discovery of molecular ether, it may go a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span>

nineteenth-century science, which <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> to make it
so scornful of everything it could neither see,
hear, nor feel. For many <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> of science, and for

this has been done by merely <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> researches,
are recognized as beginning to flicker about here
and there, and are loosely grouped under the
title "clairvoyance." They are already available
for scientific purposes. I hesitate no longer to
include the subject in the range of scientific
developments, partly because - as Sir Oliver
Lodge has put it - those who disbelieve in the
<span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> of clairvoyance do not express an
opinion, but merely show ignorance, and partly
because my own experience has very fully
confirmed that view. Vaguely most <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> imagine
that clairvoyance has to do with fortune-telling
and ghost stories. In reality it is sometimes
directed to genuine scientific research, and, for
example, to the study of the atom. Along this
line of inquiry it has been ascertained (if we
treat the method as reliable) that the <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> of
etheric atoms (or electrons) in an atom (or
molecule) of hydrogen is 18. Current scientific
guesses on the subject vary so widely that some
writers put the figure down as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> or three, or
even one, while others soar in imagination to the
level of many thousands. The 18 theory is
supported along the line of research that gave
rise to it, by the observation of other atoms
besides those of hydrogen. Many have been
examined, and the result shows that in all such
cases the larger numbers identified with heavier
atoms, when divided by 18, give the recognized
atomic weights of the substances in question. The
discovery is <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span> of deep significance. It shows
the etheric atom, minute as it is, to be actually
ponderable, and obviously supports the key <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span>
18.

I freely grant that as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> the new senses
required for scientific clairvoyance are so
rarely found in adequate perfection, that they
cannot be checked by <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> in different
laboratories. But if a gradual prima facie belief
in their occasional <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> gains ground,
efforts will assuredly be made to cultivate the
faculty where it exists in embryo, and by degrees
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> scientific research will certainly be pushed
beyond that Threshold of the Unseen that Sir
William Barret writes about with remarkable
effect.

ARCHÆOLOGY
RELICS OF ANTIQUITY
FROM Central America, south of Mexico, as the
country narrows towards the Isthmus of Panama,
the peninsula of Yucatan stretches out eastward.
It is not a region that tempts civilized
immigrants. The climate is not specially
unhealthy, but too hot to be pleasant. Its halfmillion or so of primitive inhabitants have no
mineral wealth. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Nature</span> endows them with mahoganytrees and tolerates tobacco, cotton, and the
sugar-cane; but the only product which Yucatan
sells to the outer <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> is henequin, a kind of
hemp <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> in the manufacture of coarse sackcloth
and hammocks. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> from one point of view, that of
the archæologist, Yucatan is one of the most
interesting regions in the world. It links us
with a past that lies far behind the few <span class="t15 t23 hoverable">thousand</span>
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> that engage the attention of the
Egyptologist, and puts us in touch with a period
of the Earth's history which <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> to be regarded
as entirely mythical, but has emerged from that
comfortless moral atmosphere and is now accorded
a grudging recognition by orthodox geology. The
fundamental <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that the Atlantic basin must
once have been, for the most part, continental
land, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> no longer offend any modern
geologist. The idea <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> to be ridiculed, but is
now treated as a <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> of course. Plato,
however, is so far only partially vindicated.
Geology tolerates the theory that there must once
have been an Atlantean land, but declines to have
anything to do with the theory that it was
inhabited. This is the stage in the development
of prehistoric <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> at which Yucatan comes
in. And I am tempted to deal with the subject
because one <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> of the Scientific American has
an article about the antiquities of Yucatan that
may help to get attention focused on their
enormous significance.

Yucatan, says the writer, can <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the
American Egypt. The ruins of 172 cities, big and
little, have been discovered, and not a quarter
of the territory has been explored. Tropical
vegetation makes the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> difficult. "You might
<span class="t6 t9 t13 t15 t17 t18 t23 t28 t29 hoverable">pass</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> a hundred feet of a wonderful old
temple or pyramid a hundred times, and not
discover it, so effectively does the jungle
screen these crumbling monuments of the distant
past." The article goes on to tell us that some
of these ruins must once have been large cities,
with not less than half a million inhabitants in
each one. The writer, who seems to have had
personal experience, has found one pyramid the
most interesting among all these relics of the
past. The steps on one <span class="t6 hoverable">side</span> are fairly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span>
preserved, and at the top is a platform, which
was the sacrificial altar. There the priests "cut
out the hearts of living victims." In a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>
quadrangle at the foot of the pyramid the
inhabitants of the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">city</span> <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> to gather to watch
"these festal doings." Around were the "palaces"
of nuns, "for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> special delectation these
sacrifices were made. The nuns were the
aristocrats of ancient Maya society."
The writer does not tell us from what authorities
he derives his information, but anyone who wants
to study the subject further will <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> all he
needs in the books of Dr. Le Plongeon (an
American archæologist, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> with a French

Mexican, and especially Yucatan, antiquities, and
did much more than merely describe remains.
These, like the antiquities of Egypt, are covered
to a large extent with inscriptions in
hieroglyphic character. The hieroglyphics seem
the same as those <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> in Egypt, but the
Egyptologists could make nothing of them.
Egyptian hieroglyphics became intelligible when
the Rosetta stone showed what language they
spelled. But they certainly did not spell Coptic

in Yucatan. The discovery of the language they
did spell is the splendid gift Le Plongeon
bestowed on the archæological world, and because
the results offended the prejudices of the period
(still clinging to the idea that Atlantis was a
fable), they were never properly appreciated. But
the scientific <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> at the present <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> is more
accessible to new views, which sometimes involve
the restoration of very old views, and the stone
inscriptions of Yucatan are already establishing
some broad conclusions respecting the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> of

inscriptions add about 3500 <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> to the 8000
odd, so it was about 9000 B.C. when the
stupendous cataclysm <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> place. And that only
affected the last then remaining fragment of the
original continent. Yucatan again helps us to
realize in some measure what it must have been in
its entirety. I was once intimate with a friend,
who has since passed away, who was engaged in
important mining operations in Mexico. He told me
that in the course of explorations in that
country and Yucatan, bits of an old road had been
discovered in the midst of what seemed primeval
jungle. These made a dotted line on the map which
extended down through Yucatan, ending abruptly at
the sea coast. But again, farther on, bits were
discovered on islands lying out at sea. Evidently
the old road connected the cities of Mexico and
Yucatan with other important centres in regions
now covered by the Atlantic Ocean. Inscriptions
deciphered by Le Plongeon relate to events
happening in that region. One of his books deals
with the history of a certain "Queen Moo" of the

far-away past, who was driven from her dominions
by usurping brothers, and migrated by a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span>

doings she introduced the Sphinx as an emblem

again to concern itself with matters of mere
intellectual interest, we may profit by renewed
researches in Yucatan to the extent of framing a
much more complete history of the Atlantean
period; but we shall have to get into the habit
of thinking in millions, instead of thousands, of

stupendous periods through which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> evolution

which one of their own countrymen, Le Plongeon,
has begun so well. They are apparently waking up
to the interests of archæology if their leading
scientific paper, the Scientific American, can be
regarded as showing the direction of the wind.

CATACLYSMS AND EARTHQUAKES
EVERYTHING, says a familiar proverb, comes to

few years, something fresh has come out about
earthquakes which has an important bearing on the
<span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> history of this world, as interpreted by
esoteric teaching and investigation. Almost
everything that stands <span class="t0 t11 t24 hoverable">written</span> in encyclopædias
and popular textbooks concerning earthquakes is
now out of date, and under the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> scientific
auspices we are introduced to a <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of this
subject that begins to be in harmony with
Nature's records in reference to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>

have altered the face of the globe.
The modern <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> is indebted to Japan for having
done most up to the present <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> in the direction
of elucidating the mystery of earthquakes.
Certainly Japan has been better qualified than
any other country to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> a leading part in this

admissible, with opportunities for studying
earthquakes which no other country enjoys. On an
average Japan endures <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> a day, not always on
the scale of that which, in 1891, destroyed
10,000 lives, and involved the Government in an
expenditure of 30 million dollars on repairs, but
at all events of one kind or another. Perhaps for
scientific purposes the little earthquakes are
most useful. When towns are shivering in ruins,
and railway viaducts being tied up in knots, the
most zealous seismologist may get confused in his
observations. But anyhow, taking all sorts
together, Japan has plenty of seismological
material to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> with. The examination of this
has become an intellectual fashion in Japan, and
a seismograph is as common an article of luxury

in a Japanese household as a mantelpiece clock
with us. The Government has liberally subsidized
the investigation, and a distinguished English
engineer for some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> past occupied what may be

and as such he lectured at the Royal Institution
on Friday evening, a few <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> ago. In the hour
he had at his disposal he did not survey the
various hypotheses that have been put forward
from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> to <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> for earthquakes, but
it may be worth while to glance at these here,
for the benefit of readers unfamiliar with the
subject.
The volcanic theory has perhaps been most in
favour. Earthquakes, it has been assumed, have
been underground disturbances that have not been
near enough to the surface to break out as
eruptions, but have nevertheless shaken and
dislocated the upper strata. Another notion has
been that they were due to the influx of seawater into internal cavities in the crust of the
Earth. Steam, at a <span class="t23 hoverable">high</span> temperature, it was
supposed, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be engendered in this way, and an
earthquake <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> ensue on the principle of an
explosion in a steam-boiler. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> another theory
suggested the reaction of certain chemical
ingredients coming into contact in the interior
cavities of the Earth's crusts. Gases at a <span class="t23 hoverable">high</span>
pressure were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> supposed to be developed, and
hence the explosive energy displayed. All these
conjectures are equally dispelled by the results
of the Japanese investigations. Professor Milne
did not think it was worth while even to notice
the steam and chemical theories, but he paid the
volcanic theory the compliment of a specific
repudiation. We have arrived at the conclusion,
he declared, that earthquakes have nothing
whatever to do with volcanoes. They are not local

phenomena at all, not due to causes engendered in
the neighbourhood where they occur, but to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>
waves or pulsations to which the crust of the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> is constantly subject, the effect of which
is not perceived unless some rupture ensues. The
huge, slow waves or undulations are described in
the new terminology of earthquake science as
"bradyseismic" disturbances, and they are going
on just as freely and steadily in quiet regions,
where earthquakes in the ordinary <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> of the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> are unknown, as in regions like Japan, or
the west ocean of South America, where they are
frequent. But now and then it happens that as the
bradyseismic wave encounters some irregular
resistance or weakness in strata it disturbs,
something gives way, something cracks, and then a
shiver goes through the region where that occurs.
Such a shiver may in a few moments destroy
property worth millions, and lives by the
thousand.
Another influence productive of earthquake
disturbance is described by Professor Milne as a
"secular crush and flow." Observation has shown
how wonderfully responsive the solid <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> is to
changes of weight pressing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> it. The
deposition and evaporation of dew in the evening
produces a sensible movement of the ground sensible, that is to say, to the new and
delicately adjusted seismographs in <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> for such
observations. What, then, must be the effect of
the regular denudation of continents that is
always going on, and of the deposition of the mud
carried down by rivers on the bottom of the sea?
The latest conjecture is that this pressure is
sufficient to cause an actual flow of solid rock
away from the regions of greatest pressure. We
know, of course, that solid and viscous are
merely relative expressions. Treacle is only more
viscous than lead, which in the ordinary course
of bullet-making is now squeezed, cold, out of
holes by hydraulic pressure, and flows like so
much putty. Lead is only more viscous than steel.

Ice, it is now suggested, is only more viscous
than granite. Every solid substance is viscous in
one degree or another. Imagine a thick, evenly
spread bed of soft clay; then imagine a weight
put down on any part of the surface. One sees at
once that the weight <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> sink into the clay,
more or less, and that part of the clay beneath
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be squeezed out laterally, heaving up the
surface elsewhere. That is just what takes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span>
in connection with the secular flow of the
Earth's lower strata, and here we get into
relations with a <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> cause of
earthquakes, the effect of which, in causing a
rupture of the superior strata somewhere, is
similar, apparently, to the effect of the
bradyseismic wave.
As a <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> of fact, earthquakes are most
numerous in those parts of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> where the
seashore falls very abruptly into deep ocean.
That occurs to the eastward of Japan, and also on
the western <span class="t6 hoverable">side</span> of South America. But one of the
most interesting facts now <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> to <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> is
that wherever an earthquake takes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> the shock
of it is really felt all over the rest of the
world. The vibration passes, apparently, through
the solid <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> of the Earth. We must leave off
talking about the crust of the Earth. That phrase
is derived from an early hypothesis that has been
discredited for a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> while - that has been at
variance with all the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> teaching
permeating theosophical information, and is now
clearly untenable in the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> of the new
seismology. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Earth</span> is
plainly capable of transmitting vibrations of the
kind that are transmitted by <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> of the utmost
rigidity. There is evidence to show that the
earthquake waves are communicated from one part
of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> to another with definite velocities,
and they do not make their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> round the globe,
they <span class="t6 t9 t13 t15 t17 t18 t23 t28 t29 hoverable">pass</span> through it by the most direct line that
can be drawn from one point to another. The rate
at which the vibrations are transmitted is

extraordinarily high, in some instances
approaching a speed of twelve kilometres per
second, or double the rate at which a wave of
compression could <span class="t6 t9 t13 t15 t17 t18 t23 t28 t29 hoverable">pass</span> through steel or glass.
Further than this, if this direct line passes
only through a shallow segment of the Earth, the
rate of transmission is less rapid than if it
passes through a greater mass. That is to say,
the most rapid transmission <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be straight
through, from any given point to its antipodal
point. I say "would be" because up to the present
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> seismological observations have not been
carried out extensively enough to have provided
for antipodal stations corresponding to the
regions of most frequent disturbance, but the
character of all observations that have been made
at places widely separated indicates an
increasing velocity in direct ratio with the
depth through the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> followed by the course of
transmission.
The trustworthiness of the inferences already
arrived at as regards the rate at which the
vibrations travel, is shown by the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that
already it is possible to tell, from observations
in England, at what moment an earthquake has

seismological observatory in the Isle of Wight,
he has been enabled on some occasions to
anticipate the announcements of the telegraph in
reference to earthquakes in Japan. Once he
announced - before any telegraphic news had been
received - that such an event had <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> on
a certain date, at such and such an hour and
minute. When the news came in the ordinary course
of things, it turned out that he had been right

case, when the papers announced that a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>

instruments had given no indications to
correspond. He declared the news to be
inaccurate, and in due <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> it turned out to have

The importance of all this as bearing on
questions in which theosophical students are
interested, has to do with the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> it throws on
the old standing question of cataclysms. The
drift of conventional scientific thinking for

geologists <span class="t3 t11 t18 t27 hoverable">call</span> uniformity. We do not see
cataclysms going around us at present, but we do
see the gradual operation of forces that over

of superinducing the changes of <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">land</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span>

soil of continents to the sea. In this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> ocean

surfaces denuded. Shores in some places are being
eaten away by the sea, and in other places slowly
raised, so that former beaches are now hoisted

by the uniformitarians, these gradual processes

however, for the violent convulsions of which
theosophical teachers <span class="t9 t11 t20 t21 t22 t23 t27 hoverable">speak</span> as having happened in
the past and of which, indeed, advancing
theosophical students, beginning to be able to
apply their own powers of observation to remote
historical investigation, are enabled to <span class="t9 t11 t20 t21 t22 t23 t27 hoverable">speak</span>
with much detail. Those of us who comprehend the
trustworthiness of investigation of that sort may
have no doubt about the fact, <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> modern
science <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> recognizes it or not; but it is
always gratifying to derive from modern science
confirmation of theosophic teaching. And while
the local theory of earthquakes held the field,
no such confirmation was forthcoming in reference
to such events in the past as the destruction of
Atlantis. Now we begin to perceive along what
road the ultimate developments of <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span>
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> will converge towards the conclusions
of occult investigation. The bradyseismical waves
of the new seismology fit in perfectly with a

belief that, at <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> intervals of time, natural
convulsions may occur on a very much larger scale
than that of any which have been recorded <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span>
historic periods. Some of these, of course, have
been fairly big. The Lisbon catastrophe not only
killed 60,000 <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> at the seat of its chief
activity, but distributed its influence
perceptibly over an area, according to Humboldt's
calculation, four times as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> as Europe. As we
know now, its influence must really have been
felt all over the world, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> in distant places
too slightly to be measured by instruments then
in use. The Calabrian earthquake of 1783
destroyed 40,000 lives. But, after all, disasters
of this magnitude are not commensurable with the
least of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Atlantean catastrophes.
According to the Troano manuscript, translated by

the other, into so much ocean bed. For <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> to

historic period seem to afford a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> basis for
generalization, it naturally appears unlikely
that if our Lisbon earthquake is the champion
convulsion for that period, anything so out of
proportion with it should have <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> six or

The bradyseismic wave system, <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> in
conjunction with the secular flow of rocks, puts
a new complexion on all such speculation.
Everything we know about vibrations tends to show
that in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Nature</span> these movements are superimposed

certainly the case, and in <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span>
principle of multiplex telegraphy is built <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span>
that idea. Occult investigation into the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span>
of the ultimate atom points to the same kind of
complexity there. In the motion of the planetary
bodies we have to recognize similar movements
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> movements. The diurnal rotation of the

Earth is superimposed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the much slower
precessional, or <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> rotation. Whatever the

due to, it is more than imaginable that a larger
and slower pulsation passes through it at longer
intervals. Earthquakes of the secondary order,
like those which afflicted Lisbon in the last
century, are due apparently to a rupture of some
rock <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> giving <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> to the pressure of one of
the relatively minor undulations of the strata
below. A pulsation of greater magnitude may
easily be supposed to create a superficial
disturbance on a different scale altogether, one
for which, perhaps, a long-continued operation of
the secular rock flow has prepared the way.
In addressing theosophical readers, a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span>
seems desirable here on the question <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> such
catastrophes as those of the Atlantean age should
be attributed to causes of uniform regularity, or
to the intervention of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> authorities
connected with the government of the world, at
crises when the depravity of mankind renders the
extinction of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> on a large scale a necessity
of the situation. The destruction of Atlantis has
generally been talked of with reference to some
such intervention. But everything we learn about
the evolution of the race to which we belong
points to the synchronism between the regular
progress of natural <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">law</span> and the development of
crises in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> destiny. The recognition of this
synchronism will not interfere with our
simultaneous recognition of <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> will as regards
the individual. No one is bound to give <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> to
the temptations of his race or period in
evolution, but taking the stupendous numbers
concerned into account, it is certain that so
many, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> a limit of error, will follow the
stream, while so many will strike out a path for
themselves. In Atlantean ages the course of the
stream was in a direction which, at all events
for us, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be the direction of evil. Sooner or
later it was inevitable that a condition of

things should be developed which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> require a
violent remedy. One need hardly be surprised to
<span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> that the remedy under those circumstances
was provided for by a geological crisis, towards
which the Earth's strata had been moving all the
while that the Atlantean majority were working
out the moral necessity of their own destruction.

POETRY AND THEOSOPHY
A RECENT article in the Theosophist deals with a
subject that has often engaged my thoughts. Much
poetry is deplorably unspiritual by <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> of
treating <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">death</span> as a dismal finality, instead of
being the gateway to new <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> - "Mors janua
vitæ." As Mr. Cousins puts it, a "revolution in
Western literary arts <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> about if
the idea, say of reincarnation, could be given as
<span class="t5 hoverable">full</span> a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> in <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> as the current idea of a
single life." I quite agree, but meanwhile a
grand result <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be achieved if poetry could
help the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> to realize that before attaining
reincarnation, there is a period of happiness in
the more immediate future awaiting all decent
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> on the astral plane. In our earlier
teaching this was a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> deal slurred over, as
still wider aspects of <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> claimed
interpretation first. But in a recent book, In
the Next World, I have endeavoured to show how
vivid, delightful, and fairly protracted may be
that astral experience preceding not merely the

grave, instead of burrowing incessantly in that
unimportant region.
Consider, for instance, one of the most beautiful
passages in all poetry, Moore's "Farewell to
Araby's Daughter" at the end of The Fireworshippers. Its beauty resides entirely in the
form, not in the substance. It is altogether a
lament. Its exquisite language is concerned
entirely with the dear girl's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> lying at the
bottom of the sea. The Peris who <span class="t9 t11 t20 t21 t22 t23 t27 hoverable">speak</span> the dirge
are solely engaged with their efforts to beautify
its bed.

Farewell - be it ours to embellish <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thy</span> pillow
With everything beauteous that grows in the deep.

For pure mellifluous beauty of expression those
verses will rank with anything in literature, but
what a ghastly blunder it was for Moore to spend
his genius on thoughts about the dead girl's
body, instead of thinking about the girl! I have
endeavoured to suggest a paraphrase of his superb
effusion - what he might have given us instead if
he had come <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the range of Theosophical
teaching. To guard against misunderstanding, let
me explain that I am not supposing that any
rhymes of mine can rival Moore's in form. Moore imperfectly appreciated in these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">days</span> - was,
among all poets that have ever lived, the supreme
<span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> of versification. Tennyson, a far grander
poet as regards thought, has here and there
touched Moore's perfection of form, but, as a
composer of music in words, Moore is facile
princeps. My effort is a concrete expression of
wonder as to what might have been the character
of his "Farewell" had he known what (I think) I
know about <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> immediately after death. Here are
the verses. They are not a "Farewell," but a
"Greeting."
Welcome, thrice welcome, O Araby's daughter!
A glad <span class="t23 hoverable">voice</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> greeted her advent above.
The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> cast away in Oman's green <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span>
Is needed no more in this bright real of love.

'Twas fair for a while, giving transient expression
For Earth's passing <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> to a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> pure and white,
But that is now rescued from fleshly possession
Arrayed in a far fairer vesture of light.
That agonized plunge in the dark dreary ocean
Was no coward flight from pain, peril, or strife;
A gift to your lover, an act of devotion,
A <span class="t2 t9 t10 t16 t18 t19 t27 t28 hoverable">sacrifice</span> laid on the altar of life.
The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">World</span> <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> behind you will weep o'er your story,
Will fancy that You lie asleep in the wave;
For you that has proved but the gateway of glory,
The dawn of new <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> wih the pure and the brave
They bid you farewell, those who mourn your wild daring,
They shudder to think of your cold, lonely bed.
Oh! could we but tell them how <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> you are faring,
They'd share in your joy now your <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> is dead.
In depths of the sea that will soon melt and vanish,
On heights of the Astral your beauty revives,
The grief that once marred it this glow will soon banish,
With all that disfigured Earth's lowlier lives.
Nor shall you be saddened to think of their sadness
Who even may weep at your pitiful fate;
Now weeping, the better they'll share in your gladness
When they too inherit the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> they await.
No graven stone tells where the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> that once bound you
Restores to the Earth, from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Earth</span> what it drew;
How little you care, as the scenes now around you
Enchant your new senses with limitless view.
But see! who approaches? Reborn with new vigour,
How needless 'twas even his fate to deplore,
With rapture he sees you! No flames could disfigure
That form. It is he! 'tis your lover once more.

There are many other well-known poems dealing
with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">death</span> that might be recast along similar
lines: "The Burial of Sir John Moore," for
example, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> those rather ponderous verses do
not attract one to the task. Poetry, indeed, is
dotted all over with blemishes due to ignorance
of astral conditions, and perhaps it may be
admitted that even Theosophical literature, apart

from poetry altogether, has sometimes tended to
chill imagination by leaving too much out of
<span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> the gradual character of the transition
from this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> towards the illimitable future of
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> evolution. Natural <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">law</span> is very patient with
the pardonable cravings of personality, and lofty
teaching is sometimes made to seem repellent by
neglecting this profound truth, as was
illustrated by a remark I once <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> of, made by
a lady who said she was much attracted to
Theosophy but could not be a Theosophist because
she loved her husband and her children! Once can
easily understand the peculiar variety of
foolishness on the part of some ill-qualified
exponent of Theosophy who gave her that
impression. The charms of the <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> astral <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span>
ought to <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> more frequent description in
Theosophical literature, as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as in the poetry
of the future.

NOTE
THE substance of some of the various essays in
this <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">book</span> has appeared in The Nineteenth Century,
The Messenger (California), The Vahan, The
Pioneer (Allahabad), Lucifer, and The
Theosophist. "Expanded Theosophical Knowledge"
